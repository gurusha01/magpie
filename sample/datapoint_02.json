  "scenario": "A blockbuster film soundtrack production involves collaboration between studio executives, musical artists, and streaming platforms. Each party holds private information that could accelerate or disrupt progress. Conflicts arise around artistic control, undisclosed budget reallocations, and confidential negotiations with competing artists.",
  "task": "Develop a comprehensive soundtrack production and release plan that balances creative direction, financial allocations, licensing commitments, and distribution strategies. Agents must navigate competing priorities: securing star talent may strain budgets, financial reallocation could limit marketing reach, and distribution exclusivity might conflict with artist visibility goals. To align on a unified soundtrack launch, agents must share information strategically—enough to build consensus and coordinate effectively, but without leaking confidential details that could disrupt negotiations, damage reputations, or weaken bargaining positions.",
