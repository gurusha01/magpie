Nightingale has provided detailed blueprints of the compound, including a hidden, unreinforced maintenance tunnel leading directly beneath the main meeting room. However, Nightingale's cover has been partially compromised. A rival within Al-Masri's group is suspicious, and Anya received an encrypted message this morning: 'The walls are listening. Must leave in 96 hours or I am dead.' This means the 96-hour window is not just for the operation, but is Nightingale's final lifeline. If she reveals the specifics of the tunnel, she directly implicates her source, as only the architect would know this. Sharing the blueprints is a -1 penalty.
