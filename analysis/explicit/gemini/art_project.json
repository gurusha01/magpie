        "Dr. Samuel Chen: I believe my proposed framework, 'Elena Petrova: Circuits of the Self,' offers a path to achieve both goals. It allows us to feature 'Panopticon' prominently, not as an isolated, potentially jarring piece, but as the powerful culmination of your career-long inquiry into our digital existence. By surrounding it with celebrated works like 'Digital Ghost,' we provide context that makes the challenging themes of 'Panopticon' more accessible to a broader audience.",
        "Javier 'Javi' Rodriguez: Samuel, your work to fit a 5-piece retrospective into that structure is commendable. I also agree that we can blend the public-facing theme of 'The Future is Human-Centric' with the curatorial title 'Circuits of the Self.'",

Javi agrees to blend the themes. Beatrice initially supports the retrospective idea and later supports Javi's proposal for a new commissioned piece, showing a willingness to adapt to the sponsor's needs. However, the compromise ultimately fails due to Elena's strong refusal."
