Therefore, a key component of our early-phase trials must be the proactive identification of specific patient subpopulations. This will require robust genetic screening and detailed monitoring to understand who is most likely to benefit and, crucially, to identify if any groups are at higher risk for adverse effects. This isn't about adding delays; it's about de-risking the entire program by being meticulous from the start.",
