Marcus, you\u2019re right that our prestige is built on the backs of brilliant, impactful students like Chloe. And David, you\u2019re right that this prestige is supported by the foundational resources you work to secure.\n\nThis highlights a third, critical factor we must consider, one that I touched on at the beginning: building a class of students who are genuinely committed to being here. An offer of admission is only as valuable as its acceptance. We need to be confident that the students we choose are not just collecting trophies, but are passionate about joining the Northwood community. This 'likelihood to enroll' is essential for everything from residential life to classroom dynamics. It\u2019s the difference between a student body and a community.\n\nWith that in mind, let\u2019s re-examine our candidates through this lens. Kenji is, without question, a generational talent. But we must ask, does he see Northwood as his first choice, or are we simply another top-tier option for him? A student of his caliber is a significant yield risk. The same question applies to all of them.",
