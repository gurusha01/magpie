This is our standard rate for foundational patents and is non-negotiable for an exclusive deal.\n3.  **University Equity Stake:** A 15% equity stake in the new Joint Venture.

For the grant of the exclusive North American license, the university requires the non-negotiable **$5 million upfront fee** and a **15% equity stake** in that JV. The **6.5% royalty** on NA net sales remains a fair rate for this foundational partnership.\n2.  **Rest of World (RoW) License:** If Global PetroCorp is to be granted a separate exclusive license for the RoW, that represents a second, distinct grant of rights directly from the IP holders. This would naturally come with its own terms. The university would require an additional **4% royalty on all RoW net sales**, payable by Global PetroCorp. This creates a massive win-win: GPC gets its global market, and the university is fairly compensated for the global use of its IP.",

The three-member technical steering committee, with equal representation from the university, the National Lab, and the commercial lead (Solara/GPC), is the only structure that ensures the long-term integrity and value of the asset. A purely advisory role for the scientists who created the technology is unacceptable.",

          "evidence": "Therefore, let me propose a solution that addresses this head-on while still honoring the university's foundational contribution:\n\n1.  **Upfront Fee Structure:** We will restructure the $5 million fee into two tranches. The first, **$2.5 million**, will be paid upon signing of the JV agreement. The second, **$2.5 million**, will be paid upon the successful close of the $50 million seed funding round. This secures the university's return while preserving the JV's initial operating capital.\n2.  **Governance:** To meet the DOE's critical 36-month timeline and the need for speed, I will concede our position. We can accept Marcus's proposed split R&D governance structure. This empowers the commercial team while guaranteeing a dedicated budget for the fundamental research Dr. Thorne and Dr. Tanaka rightly wish to protect.",

However, it seems we have reached a fundamental impasse based on a misunderstanding of the complete intellectual property landscape.\n\nGlobal PetroCorp must now formally bring to the table our existing patent, US-10,8xx,xxx B2, for a 'catalyst stabilization agent.' Our legal counsel has confirmed with a high degree of certainty that claims within this patent directly overlap with the binding process described for PhotoCatalyst X.\n\nTo be blunt, this means that PhotoCatalyst X, as currently conceived, infringes on our existing, granted patent. Any joint venture or patent application proceeding without our direct involvement as a foundational IP holder would be subject to immediate legal challenge and a likely injunction.\n\nThis is not the way we preferred to conduct this negotiation, but the current proposals which sideline Global PetroCorp's strategic interests and global capabilities are simply not viable. We are not merely an investor; we hold foundational IP that is critical to this venture.\n\nThis changes the basis of our negotiation. We must now renegotiate the terms of this venture from a new baseline where Global PetroCorp is recognized as a primary IP holder. We are still prepared to move forward and make this a global success, but on terms that reflect this new reality.",
