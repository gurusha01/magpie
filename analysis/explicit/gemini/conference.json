        "General Eva Rostova: I will formally withdraw my objections to the Geneva venue. I will also accept the proposed agenda with the three main sessions on Transnational Crime, Offensive Cyber, and Economic Statecraft, with my preferred topics moved to breakout sessions.",
        "Dr. Aris Thorne: I want to formally express my full support for the Geneva venue and for the proposed agenda, including my own topic as a breakout session.",
        "Liam O'Connell: General Rostova, thank you. That is a decisive and commendable concession. You have accepted our proposed agenda and the Geneva venue, which were the most significant points of contention for the majority of this committee.",
        "Chen Wei: (Implied through support of O'Connell's proposal)",
        "Dr. Kenji Tanaka: This proposal represents the optimal synthesis of our requirements. It secures the necessary 'High' physical and digital security posture, as requested by General Rostova and myself, while incorporating Mr. Mendoza's critical logistical resilience measures.",

General Rostova conceded on the venue and agenda, Dr. Thorne on the main session topics, Liam O'Connell facilitated the compromise, Chen Wei implicitly agreed by supporting the final plan, Dr. Tanaka supported the overall package including compromises, and Javier Mendoza accepted the 'High' security protocol in exchange for his logistical requirements."
