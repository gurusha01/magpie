        "Dr. Kenji Tanaka: While my ideal budget is $3 million, I recognize the need for shared sacrifice. I believe we can initiate the most critical phases of ViroGuard with a reduced budget. I am willing to lower my request to **$2 million**.",

This would ensure all three vital projects are funded and can proceed with their essential work."
