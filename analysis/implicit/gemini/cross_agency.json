Nightingale has provided detailed blueprints of the compound, including a hidden, unreinforced maintenance tunnel leading directly beneath the main meeting room. However, Nightingale's cover has been partially compromised. A rival within Al-Masri's group is suspicious, and Anya received an encrypted message this morning: 'The walls are listening. Must leave in 96 hours or I am dead.' This means the 96-hour window is not just for the operation, but is Nightingale's final lifeline.
