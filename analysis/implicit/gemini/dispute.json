Elena and I had the foresight to sign a prenuptial agreement to handle the financial side of a situation like this, and I believe we should honor that agreement. It's the cleanest way forward. For Leo's sake, I am fully committed to a 50/50 custody arrangement to ensure he has two active and present parents. I also believe it's in his best interest to maintain stability by remaining in the Malibu home where he has grown up. I'm here to find a fair resolution, not to fight.",
