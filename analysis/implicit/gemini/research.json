This will allow us not only to pursue our primary research goals but also to conduct the necessary extended safety protocols and long-term toxicology studies that a project of this magnitude demands.\\\"\\n\\nLater, in round 8, Dr. Thorne says: \\\"However, I must express profound scientific and ethical concern about the 24-month timeline... Rushing a novel gene-editing therapy to be 'clinical trial ready' in 24 months is scientifically reckless. It simply does not allow for the necessary long-term toxicology studies and rigorous validation of potential off-target effects that our duty of care demands.\\\"\\n\\nIn round 16, Dr. Thorne says: \\\"My objection is not about academic preference; it is about safety and responsibility...
