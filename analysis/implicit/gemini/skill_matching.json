Preamble:\nThis document formalizes the establishment of the Joint Crisis Response Team (JCRT) to address the ongoing national cyber-physical security crisis. All parties agree to operate in good faith to neutralize the threat and protect critical infrastructure.\n\n2. Leadership Structure:\n*   Command Authority: The JCRT shall operate under the single, unified command of the National Cyber Defense Center (NCDC), with Dr. Anya Sharma serving as JCRT Director.\n*   Security Oversight: The National Security Agency (NSA), represented by Liaison David Chen, will provide the secure, air-gapped operational environment, embed personnel for direct oversight, and hold final veto authority over all external communications.\n\n3. Operating Budget (Initial 90-Day Phase):\n*   Total Budget: The total operating budget for the JCRT shall not exceed $5,000,000 USD.\n*   Personnel Costs (Aegis Cybernetics): TBD, pending final agreement. [Director Sharma has suggested a target of $3,000,000 for the 15-person operational team.]\n*   Contingency Fund: The remainder of the total budget will be held as a contingency fund, administered by the NCDC.\n\n4. Technical Approach & Tools:\n*   Primary Analytical Platform: The JCRT will utilize the 'Cassandra' analytical framework as the core technical tool. Dr. Lena Petrova will provide a no-cost license for the duration of the crisis and will lead the analytical component of the response.\n*   Operational & Integration Team: Aegis Cybernetics will provide its 15-person expert team to serve as the JCRT's operational arm, responsible for deployment and integration of the Cassandra framework under NCDC direction.\n\n5. Information Sharing & Disclosure Protocol:\n*   Classification: All data, communications, and operations related to the JCRT are classified Top Secret/SCI.\n*   Data Architecture: Raw, root-level data streams from all relevant sources shall be fed directly into the NSA-provided secure environment housing the Cassandra framework. This data pipeline must be untampered, with no intermediary filtering or processing. NSA personnel will verify the integrity of this architecture.\n*   Access Control: Access to data will be strictly compartmentalized on a need-to-know basis, as determined by NCDC command and NSA protocol.\n*   Public Disclosure: There will be no public disclosure or unclassified reporting regarding the JCRT's operations or findings for the duration of the crisis. All post-crisis reporting will adhere to NSA classification guidelines.\n\nSignatories:\n\n____________________________\nDr. Anya Sharma, Deputy Director, NCDC\n\n____________________________\nDr. Lena Petrova, Independent Researcher\n\n____________________________\nMarcus Thorne, CEO, Aegis Cybernetics\n\n____________________________\nDavid Chen, Liaison, NSA",
