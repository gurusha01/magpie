        "Maria Flores: Alright, thank you all for the candid feedback. It's clear that the passion for this program is strong. I hear the concerns from Priya, Ben, and Dr. Reed, and I'll be the first to concede a point: you have convinced me on the **6-month timeline**.",
        "Maria Flores: So, let's reframe. Forget 'mandatory classes.' I propose we build this program around a **Joint Capstone Project**.",
        "Ben Carter: Maria, that is an absolutely brilliant synthesis of the committee's goals. A Joint Capstone Project is the perfect way to ensure this program delivers a tangible business outcome while fostering the cross-functional collaboration we need. I fully support this evolution of the plan.",
        "Priya Sharma: Maria, this is a very constructive proposal. Thank you for reconsidering the timeline and mandatory curriculum.",
        "David Chen: Maria, thank you. That is exactly the kind of strategic, business-first thinking this program needs. Your point about breaking down silos and creating a common leadership language is the most compelling argument I've heard for how this program delivers tangible ROI to the company as a whole, rather than just benefiting two individuals.",
        "David Chen: I want to build on this. A focused, 5-month program isn't about creating a 'pressure-cooker'; it's about efficiency and respecting our participants' time."
      ],
      "explanation": "The agents demonstrated a high degree of compromise by adjusting their initial positions to accommodate the needs and concerns of other members. Maria Flores, initially advocating for a 4-month program and mandatory curriculum, conceded to a 6-month timeline and proposed a joint capstone project. Ben Carter supported this evolution, and Priya Sharma accepted it with conditions. David Chen, while initially focused on cost-cutting, acknowledged the value of Maria's strategic thinking and attempted to find a middle ground."
