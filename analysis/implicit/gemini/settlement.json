        "Maria Rodriguez: Dr. Reed, thank you for your candor. You've brought a crucial new element to the table and, I believe, opened a pathway to a resolution. You've linked two points: your refusal of a 'public admission of fault' and your demand for a court order to seal all R&D documents. Let's work with that linkage.",
        "Maria Rodriguez: My clients are not seeking to 'rewrite scientific history.' They are seeking acknowledgment of the devastating reality they now face. A public statement from OmniPharm acknowledging the 'unfortunate health outcomes' experienced by CardiaCure users, and outlining the concrete steps you will take to ensure patient safety moving forward, is not an admission of legal fault. It is an act of corporate responsibility, and it is essential for the victims to feel seen.",
        "Dr. Evelyn Reed: However, we are here to find a resolution that avoids a trial. To that end, any potential settlement must include a non-negotiable term from our side. For us to agree to any financial compensation, the settlement must include a comprehensive and permanent court order sealing all proprietary research, development data, and internal communications disclosed during this process."

      "explanation": "Maria Rodriguez showed willingness to compromise by reframing the 'public acknowledgment' demand into a 'statement of corporate responsibility' and linking it to the sealing of documents.
