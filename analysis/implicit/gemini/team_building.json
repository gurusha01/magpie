To win, we need to be first and make a massive splash. That means our launch target is the end of Q3. This is not just a goal; it's a must-do for the business. Investor and board expectations are crystal clear on this point.\\\"\\n\\nIn round 4, Anya states, \\\"First, the timeline. Let me be unequivocal: Q3 is not a preference, it's a hard business dependency tied to our next funding round. Missing it means more than just being late to market; it jeopardizes the financial future of the company. A Q4 launch is not an option, and Q1 is a non-starter. The entire project hinges on us being in-market by the end of September. The question isn't *if* we can do it, but *how* we will make it happen.\\\"\\n\\nIn round 17, Anya states, \\\"However, let's be crystal clear on one point: a Q1 launch is not an option.

To be clear, if we launch with this flaw, it could lead to a catastrophic and public failure. We'd be a case study in what not to do.\n\nThis isn't 'technical debt' or a preference for 'perfection'. This is a foundational, product-breaking issue.\n\nMy analysis, confirmed by external contacts, is that a proper fix requires a specialist with a deep background in adversarial machine learning\u2014exactly the profile of Leo Vance or Evelyn Reed. We cannot assign this to an internal engineer. The estimated time to fully patch, test, and validate the fix is 6-8 weeks of dedicated work, and that's *after* we hire them.\n\nThis discovery makes a Q4 launch impossible.
