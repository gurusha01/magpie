        "Ava Chen: It seems we have a powerful equation here. Marcus, you're offering a significant investment to make this a tentpole event for StreamVerse, contingent on a commercially viable package. Leo, you need the resources to create a masterpiece. I see a path where we can achieve both. We can insulate the core score, giving you, Leo, the creative freedom you need for that singular vision, while separately creating a lead single that satisfies the marketing and discovery goals Marcus has outlined.",
        "Ava Chen: What if we treat the single as a separate entity? Perhaps a major artist creates a song 'inspired by' a theme from your score? You would have consultation rights, ensuring it honors the film's tone, but the creative burden wouldn't be on you.",
        "Marcus Thorne: Ava, that is an excellent and productive framework. Separating the 'Original Score' from a 'Promotional Single' is precisely the kind of strategic thinking this partnership needs.",
        "Marcus Thorne: Leo, under this structure, your artistic control over the 'Original Score' would be absolute and contractually guaranteed. This also includes the two exclusive tracks for our platform, which must be part of your score.",
        "Marcus Thorne: Regarding the 'Promotional Single,' the concept of 'consultation rights' is a good one. We see this as a process where you would share the core musical themes with the selected pop artist and our team, ensuring the resulting track is tonally 'inspired by' your work.",
        "Leo Vance: Here is my counter-proposal for your exclusive content package: 1. The 'Making of the Music' Documentary: A featurette, as you suggested, giving an inside look at my creative process. 2. Two Exclusive Alternate Score Cues: Not remixes. These will be unique, alternate versions of key pieces from the score, composed and produced entirely by me, available only on StreamVerse."
      ],
      "explanation": "Ava attempts to find a middle ground by proposing a separate promotional single and offering Leo consultation rights. Marcus initially accepts this framework and clarifies the mechanics. Leo attempts to compromise by offering alternative exclusive content instead of a pop single, but this is ultimately rejected by Marcus."
