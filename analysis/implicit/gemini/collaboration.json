It is the practical, methodical application of caution and rigor to ensure we do no harm. This means the clinical trial timeline cannot be dictated by a commercial desire to get to market in 'X' number of years. It *must* be dictated by scientific milestones, by the data we gather, and by an unwavering commitment to patient safety.\\n\\nTo that end, ensuring this therapy is safe for everyone requires that we design our trials to carefully identify and monitor specific patient subpopulations who might react differently. This is not a 'nice to have'; it is a core scientific and ethical responsibility. Rushing this process would be a betrayal of the very people we are trying to help.\",\n      \"explanation\": \"Dr. Thorne hints at the need to investigate specific patient subpopulations without revealing the specific genetic marker (APOE4-variant Gamma) or the severe neuroinflammation.
