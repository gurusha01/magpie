        "Dr. Evelyn Reed: I will drop my request for double-time overtime. We can maintain the current 1.5x rate. I will also reduce my capital request by half: we will purchase only ONE STAT-X analyzer for now. In exchange for these concessions, we must lift the hiring freeze and approve the hiring of three new RNs.",

        "Dr. Ben Carter: A 10% stipend increase is a positive step, but it doesn't quite reflect the increased burden that a hiring freeze will place on the team. I believe a 20% increase is the necessary number to make this plan work.",

Sarah proposed a middle ground on the hiring freeze. The final agreement reflects a balance of everyone's needs."
