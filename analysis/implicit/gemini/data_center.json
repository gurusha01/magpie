A flat 25% cut of the developable land would challenge the viability of our campus footprint. Could we explore a more strategic approach? For instance, perhaps the easement could be applied to land less suitable for construction, such as the river buffer zones, thereby achieving the conservation goal while preserving the contiguous, flat acreage required for the campus itself.",
        "Dr. Alistair Finch: We can commit to a transparent process with binding mitigation requirements, but not a process that can unilaterally veto the project after we've committed millions. This is a critical distinction.",
        "David Chen: Your suggestion to focus the conservation easement on ecologically sensitive areas like the river buffer zones is a constructive one. That land is prime habitat for the Bell's vireo. We can agree on that principle."

      "explanation": "Brenda Chen shows a willingness to compromise on the land easement by suggesting focusing on less suitable land. Dr. Finch is willing to commit to binding mitigation measures instead of a binding EIR. David Chen agrees to focus the easement on ecologically sensitive areas."
