From a purely technical standpoint, there is an overlap.\n\nHowever, it is also important to note two additional technical points for context. First, the language of the patent claims is quite broad, which is a significant factor in this overlap. Second, from an engineering perspective, it is my assessment that designing a non-infringing alternative to the 'Dynamic-Charge' system is technically feasible for a team with OmniCorp's resources, though it would require a dedicated development cycle.",
