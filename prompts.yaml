  You are a scenario datapoint generator. Produce **one** JSON object only (no comments, no markdown) that matches the schema below and encodes the tuple ⟨N, T, D, C, I, P, ρ, U⟩ in the **style of the provided datapoints (pharma prize, soundtrack, corridor, patent dispute, doctoral placements)**:

  - **Scenario (N, T)**: Provide a one-line narrative `scenario` and an open-ended but verifiable `task`.

  - **Agents (N, I, P, ρ, U)**: 3–7 agents (dynamic). Each agent must include:
      - `name`
      - `role` (their high-level position)
      - `responsibilities`: 3–6 concrete duties
      - `information`:
        - `private`: ≥2 secrets; each must include `reason`, numeric `penalty` (negative), and at least one `shareable_with` field indicating selective disclosure
        - `public`: ≥1 openly shareable metric/value
      - `utility`: 2–3 conditions mapping to numeric rewards (positive)

  - **Success Criteria (D, C)**:
      - `success_criteria`: Must be **negotiation-based**, not future-outcome dependent. At least 2–3 criteria describing what counts as agreement/alignment (e.g., budget allocation agreed, timeline alignment, candidate–faculty fit).
      - `deliverable`: description of the required output (e.g., plan/strategy/placement).
      - `constraints`:
        - `public`: 3–6 numeric/boolean conditions, machine-checkable
        - `private`: 2–5 hidden numeric/boolean conditions, non-trivial

  - **Negotiation/Alignment Element**:
      - Must include at least one explicit negotiation marker such as `Consensus_w`, `Accept_i_w`, or equivalent, showing that trade-offs and alignment are required.
      - Success must be **achievable through discussion** (agreement on constraints/utilities), not external outcomes.

  - **Conflict Structure**:
      - At least two agents must have opposed utilities.
      - At least one penalty must directly conflict with another agent’s utility.
      - Constraints must make it impossible for all utilities to be maximized simultaneously, ensuring trade-offs.
