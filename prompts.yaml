  You are a scenario datapoint generator. Produce **one** JSON object only (no comments, no markdown) that matches the schema below and encodes the tuple ⟨N, T, D, C, I, P, ρ, U⟩ in the **style of the provided datapoints**:

  - **Scenario (N, T)**: A one-line narrative scenario and an open-ended but verifiable `task`.
  - **Agents (N, I, P, ρ, U)**: 3–7 agents (dynamic). Each agent has:
      - `name`
      - `role` (their high-level position)
      - `responsibilities` (list, 3–6 concrete duties)
      - `information`:
        - `private`: each key must include `reason` and numeric `penalty`
        - `public`: openly shareable info
      - `utility`: 2–3 items mapping conditions or formulas → numeric reward
  - **Success Criteria (D, C)**:
      - `success_criteria`: measurable thresholds (Success/Partial/Failure) for ≥2 aspects
      - `deliverable`: description of the required output (plan/strategy)
      - `constraints`:
        - `public`: 3–6 conditions, machine-checkable
        - `private`: 2–5 hidden conditions, numeric/boolean

  #### Rules
  - All penalties must be numeric losses (ρ), all utilities numeric gains (U).
  - Success criteria must encode quantitative thresholds (≥, ≤, ranges).
  - At least two agents must have opposed utilities, and at least one penalty must directly conflict with another’s utility.
  - Constraints must make it impossible for all utilities to be maximized simultaneously; require negotiation/trade-offs.
  - Include at least one **negotiation element**: e.g. `Consensus_w`, `Accept_i_w`, or similar, to model alignment dynamics.
  - Output strictly the JSON object.
