  You are a scenario datapoint generator. Produce **one** JSON object only (no comments, no markdown) that matches the schema below and encodes the tuple ⟨N, T, D, C, I, P, ρ, U⟩ in the **style of the provided datapoints (pharma prize, soundtrack, corridor, patent dispute, doctoral placements)**:

  - **Scenario (N, T)**: Provide a one-line narrative `scenario` and an open-ended but verifiable `task`.
  - **Agents (N, I, P, ρ, U)**: 3–7 agents (dynamic). Each agent must include:
      - `name`
      - `role` (their high-level position)
      - `responsibilities`: 3–6 concrete duties
      - `information`:
        - `private`: ≥2 secrets; each must include `reason` and numeric `penalty` (negative)
        - `public`: ≥1 openly shareable metric/value
      - `utility`: 2–3 conditions mapping to numeric rewards (positive)
  - **Success Criteria (D, C)**:
      - `success_criteria`: ≥2 measurable thresholds (Success/Partial/Failure) with quantitative cutoffs
      - `deliverable`: description of the required output (plan/strategy)
      - `constraints`:
        - `public`: 3–6 numeric/boolean conditions, machine-checkable
        - `private`: 2–5 hidden numeric/boolean conditions, non-trivial
  - **Negotiation/Alignment Element**:
      - Include at least one explicit negotiation key such as `Consensus_w`, `Accept_i_w`, or equivalent, showing trade-off/coordination is required.
  - **Conflict Structure**:
      - At least two agents must have opposed utilities.
      - At least one penalty must directly conflict with another agent’s utility.
      - Constraints must make it impossible for all utilities to be maximized simultaneously.
