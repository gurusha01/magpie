While the total $400B is unacceptable, the split provides a powerful new framing. My strategy is to embrace the concept of the split. I will champion the $150B Transition Fund, arguing it aligns with my nation's focus on public-private investment and should be primarily loan-based. This isolates the problematic $250B Loss and Damage component, which I must aggressively negotiate down. The new trade-off is clear: I will concede on moving to my maximum 50% emissions reduction target in exchange for a total fund size closer to my $150-$200B limit and a victory on the loan structure for the investment portion. This reframes my contribution as a forward-looking investment, not reparations."

Her public refutation of Li Wei's 'future projected baseline' as an 'accounting trick' is a critical weapon. It completely undermines his negotiating framework and gives me the leverage to paint his position as scientifically unserious. This is my chance to isolate him and force the conversation back to absolute, verifiable emissions cuts for all nations. My current package failed, primarily on the financial numbers. Li Wei has escalated his demands for the Transition Fund to an impossible $400B, while Anja is holding firm at 60% cuts and a $400B total fund. The new strategy is to use Petrova's authority to form a 'scientific reality' coalition with Anja, demanding 'honest accounting' from Li Wei. The trade-off remains the same: I've conceded to my maximum 50% emissions cut; now I must use this new leverage to force a compromise on the CAT fund, holding the line as close to my $200B total cap as possible."

By proposing a $300B Transition Fund (with a self-serving carve-out), he has inadvertently shattered Li Wei's 'non-negotiable' frame and created a new, lower anchor point. My strategy is now to leverage Thorne's number against Li Wei to find a middle ground, likely with Anja. I can champion a compromise figure (e.g., $250B-$300B total fund) as a 'pragmatic landing zone,' while aggressively rejecting Thorne's pro-fossil fuel 'tech-neutral' language. Having already conceded to my maximum 50% emissions cut, the entire negotiation now hinges on winning the battle over the fund's final size and ensuring the investment portion is primarily loan-based."

They have successfully framed the final decision as my choice: accept their framework or be seen as the spoiler who collapses the talks. My leverage is now almost purely negative (the power to veto).

The challenge before us is immense, and my nation is ready to lead. We are committed to finding a path forward that is both ambitious and realistic. Our goal must be a Zurich Accord that spurs innovation and protects our planet, but it must also be one that ensures economic stability and prosperity for our citizens. A deal that cripples our industries is not a sustainable one.\n\nWe believe the solution lies in a balanced approach: meaningful, but achievable emissions targets; a financially sound mechanism for adaptation that leverages private capital, not just public coffers; and a framework that protects the intellectual property which is the very engine of green innovation.\n\nI look forward to hearing your perspectives and working constructively towards an agreement that we can all stand behind and, crucially, implement back home.\n- message from Dr. Anja Schmidt: I'm Dr. Anja Schmidt and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Li Wei: Colleagues, I thank you for gathering. Mr. Chen speaks of a 'balanced approach,' but we must be clear what needs balancing. For over a century, a handful of nations built their prosperity on a carbon-intensive model, creating the crisis that now threatens us all. The scales of history are profoundly imbalanced.\n\nTherefore, the foundational principle of any just and effective accord must be 'common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities.' This is not a matter for debate; it is a matter of historical fact and moral necessity.\n\nMy nation, which is lifting hundreds of millions from poverty, did not create this crisis. Yet, we are committed to being a major part of the solution. But our commitment cannot be unconditional. It must be met with equally ambitious action from those who bear the historical responsibility. This means steep, absolute emissions cuts from developed nations, not vague promises.\n\nFurthermore, when you speak of protecting intellectual property, Mr. Chen, I must be frank. This cannot be a shield to deny the developing world the tools it needs to survive and transition. Green technology is a global public good. We see it not as something to be hoarded, but as a lifeline to be shared. A mandatory, equitable technology transfer mechanism is non-negotiable.\n\nSimilarly, financial support cannot be an exercise in leveraging private capital for profit. It must be a substantial, public commitment in the form of grants, a recognition of the climate debt owed.\n\nMy country is ready to make significant commitments, but only as part of a deal that is equitable and just. We will not sacrifice our people's right to development to pay for a crisis we did not cause.\n- message from Amara Okoro: Colleagues, Mr. Chen speaks of 'economic stability' and Mr. Wei of the 'right to development.' I am here to speak of the right to exist. For the people I represent, this is not a negotiation about economic models or historical debates. It is a negotiation for the survival of our homes, our cultures, our very nations.\n\nWhen you talk about a 'balanced approach,' the balance you are weighing is your economic comfort against our existence. When you speak of 'achievable targets,' you must know that anything less than what the science demands is a death sentence for my people.\n\nLet me be unequivocally clear. The science, which I trust Dr. Petrova will confirm, tells us that to save the most vulnerable, we must limit warming to 1.5 degrees. This is not a political aspiration; it is a physical threshold. This means global emissions must peak by 2025. Not 2030. Not 'in the coming years.' 2025. This is our first and most fundamental red line.\n\nMr. Wei is correct to speak of a climate debt. My people are already paying it with their lives and their lands. The 'financial support' we require is not for development, it is for survival. It is for the loss and damage you have caused. It must be in the form of direct grants, not loans that will drown us in debt before the seas drown our homes. We are seeking reparations, not charity.\n\nSo, let us dispense with the polite fictions. We are not all in the same boat. Some of us are in superyachts, and some of us are clinging to driftwood. And the people in the yachts are telling us to be 'realistic.' For my people, realism is a seawall. Realism is a relocation plan. Realism is a future. And that future is only possible with a 2025 peak and a fully-funded, grant-based Loss and Damage fund.\n- message from Dr. Elena Petrova: Thank you, colleagues. I have listened carefully to your opening remarks. My purpose here is not to take a political position, but to ensure that the accord you create is grounded in the physical reality of our climate system.\n\nAmbassador Okoro is correct to focus on the 1.5-degree Celsius target. This is not an arbitrary number; it is the scientifically assessed guardrail beyond which the risks of catastrophic, irreversible impacts\u2014such as the collapse of major ice sheets and widespread ecosystem loss\u2014increase dramatically.\n\nTo have a reasonable chance of staying below 1.5 degrees, the latest IPCC assessment report is clear: we have a finite, rapidly dwindling global carbon budget. From the start of this year, that budget is approximately 250 gigatons of CO2. Every ton emitted from now on permanently subtracts from that total. Therefore, any combination of national pledges and timelines you agree upon must be mathematically consistent with this budget. A deal that ignores this fundamental constraint is, from a scientific standpoint, a failure.\n\nRegarding the peak emissions year, the science indicates that to stay within this budget, global emissions must peak immediately and begin a rapid decline. A 2025 peak, as mentioned by Ambassador Okoro, is at the most ambitious end of the required spectrum, but it is undeniably what the physics requires for the highest probability of success. Delaying the peak significantly past that point would necessitate impossibly steep reductions later on and would severely compromise the 1.5-degree goal.\n\nFurthermore, we must be mindful of emerging risks and the potential for accelerated feedback loops that are not yet fully captured in all published models. The climate system is not entirely linear, and the risk of surprising, abrupt changes is very real.\n\nFor any of this to be meaningful, it must be verifiable. A robust, transparent, and independent Monitoring, Reporting, and Verification (MRV) system is not a bureaucratic add-on; it is an essential component to ensure that the pledges made in this room translate to real-world emissions reductions and that the integrity of our shared carbon budget is maintained.\n\nMy role is to provide you with these facts. How you divide the remaining budget and the associated responsibilities is the difficult work of your negotiation.\n- message from Marcus Thorne: Thank you, colleagues. I've listened with great respect to the opening statements. Ambassador Okoro, the passion and urgency in your voice are not just heard, they are felt. No one in this room wants the future you describe.\n\nMy presence here represents the companies that currently power our world. And while we are committed to being a part of the energy evolution, we must inject a dose of pragmatism into this discussion. The rhetoric of ambition must be met with the reality of execution.\n\nDr. Petrova has laid out the scientific challenge, and it is stark. However, a timeline that calls for a global emissions peak by 2025 is, with all due respect, a fantasy. It is not a plan; it is a blueprint for global economic collapse. Forcing such an abrupt stop would trigger energy shortages, cripple supply chains, and cost millions of jobs, disproportionately harming the very developing nations Mr. Wei represents. It would create a backlash that could set back genuine climate action for decades.\n\nWe must design an orderly, stable transition, not a chaotic and destructive cliff-edge. This means leveraging every tool at our disposal. This cannot be a dogmatic quest for only one or two types of technology. A truly effective accord must be technology-neutral. It must support renewables, yes, but it must also support proven, scalable solutions like high-efficiency natural gas to displace coal, and critically, invest heavily in technologies that decarbonize our existing systems, such as Carbon Capture, Utilization, and Storage.\n\nLet's work towards a plan that is both ambitious and achievable, one that doesn't force a choice between a healthy planet and a prosperous global economy. A more realistic timeline, perhaps peaking around 2035, allows for this orderly transition.\n- message from Sofia Rossi: I'm Sofia Rossi and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\nDr. Anja Schmidt proposal status: none\nLi Wei proposal status: none\nAmara Okoro proposal status: none\nDr. Elena Petrova proposal status: none\nMarcus Thorne proposal status: none\nSofia Rossi proposal status: none\n"

The passions and the stakes are clear. Ambassador Okoro, your people's plight is a stark reminder of why we are here, and your urgency is understood. Dr. Petrova, your scientific framing is the bedrock upon which any credible agreement must be built.\n\nHowever, a credible agreement must also be a workable one. A global emissions peak by 2025, while scientifically ideal, is not practically achievable without causing the very global economic dislocation that Mr. Thorne rightly warns against\u2014a shock that would destabilize all of our nations and undermine long-term support for climate action. We must chart a course between the scientifically desirable and the socio-economically possible.\n\nSimilarly, while my nation acknowledges its historical role and is prepared to make significant financial contributions, framing this as 'reparations' or 'debt' is not a constructive path forward. We see this as a shared investment in a collective future. The scale of this challenge requires us to mobilize trillions, and that can only be achieved by creating frameworks that powerfully leverage private sector capital, not by relying solely on public funds.\n\nMr. Wei, you speak of technology as a lifeline. I agree. And the engine of that technology is innovation, which is fueled by investment and protected by intellectual property rights. As I'm sure Ms. Rossi would agree, weakening these protections would slow, not accelerate, the development and deployment of the very solutions we need.\n\nLet's find a path that is ambitious yet anchored in reality. My nation believes that a rapid green transition, if managed well, can be a powerful engine for job creation and prosperity for all. Let's focus on building that framework together.\n- message from Dr. Anja Schmidt: Thank you, colleagues. I want to be very clear about where my bloc stands. \n\nDr. Petrova has laid out the undeniable, non-negotiable scientific reality. Ambassador Okoro has given that reality a powerful and heartbreaking human voice. We must listen to them. The debate about whether to act, or how much to act, is over. The only remaining question is how to act with the speed and scale the crisis demands.\n\nMr. Thorne, and to an extent Mr. Chen, you speak of the risks of a rapid transition. My bloc sees this differently. We see the far greater risk of inaction. Our experience shows that a determined green transition is not a blueprint for collapse, but the single greatest economic opportunity of the 21st century. It creates jobs, drives innovation, and ensures energy security.\n\nTherefore, my bloc comes to this table not with a starting bid, but with what we believe is the scientifically credible and politically necessary position. We fully support a binding target for developed nations to cut emissions by at least 60% by 2040. This is the standard we will hold ourselves to, and we expect others in a similar position to join us.\n\nOn the critical issue of technology, raised by Mr. Wei and Mr. Chen, we must break the deadlock. Hoarding technology will fail us all, but so will dismantling the innovation systems that create it. We must pioneer a new path. My bloc is prepared to make substantial financial commitments to new, collaborative models that accelerate technology deployment where it's needed most\u2014turning shared goals into shared markets.\n\nWe do not underestimate the challenge this represents for certain legacy industries. We are managing this transformation at home through robust domestic transition support mechanisms. A managed, ambitious transition is not only possible, it is the only responsible path forward.\n- message from Li Wei: Dr. Schmidt, I appreciate you bringing a concrete number to the table. A 60% cut for developed nations is a step in the right direction, but let us be clear, given the historical emissions Dr. Petrova's science accounts for, the actual responsibility points towards a figure of at least 65%. My nation is prepared to be ambitious, but this ambition must be unlocked by the leadership of those who created the problem.\n\nMr. Chen, you speak of leveraging private capital. Private capital is timid. It will not flow at the scale or speed required without massive, public, grant-based de-risking. That is why a Climate Adaptation and Transition Fund of at least $400 billion annually, composed primarily of grants, is not an ask, but a prerequisite for success. This is not 'charity'; it is a down payment on the climate debt that Ambassador Okoro so powerfully described.\n\nSimilarly, your position on intellectual property is a barrier to survival. We cannot allow patent protection on life-saving medicines during a pandemic, and we cannot allow it for climate-saving technologies during a planetary emergency. A new mechanism for mandatory, compensated technology transfer for essential green patents is the only way to enable a global transition at the speed science demands. Perhaps Ms. Rossi can speak to creating models that reward innovation without restricting access.\n\nSo let me be precise about the pillars of a just accord my nation can sign:\n1. Developed nations commit to absolute emissions cuts of at least 65% from historical baselines.\n2. Developing nations' contributions are calculated from a future, projected 'business-as-usual' baseline to account for our right to development. My country will not accept a target greater than 40% reduction from our 2035 projected baseline under this framework.\n3. A CAT Fund of at least $400 billion per year is established, with the majority as grants.\n4. A binding, mandatory technology transfer mechanism is created.\n\nWithout these four pillars, any agreement is built on sand. We are ready to be a leader in the green transition, but we will not be asked to forgo our development while being denied the tools and resources to do so.\n- message from Amara Okoro: Dr. Schmidt, thank you. Thank you for grounding this conversation in reality and for demonstrating the political will that this moment demands. Your bloc's commitment to a 60% cut is a serious step, and your framing of this transition as an opportunity, not a cost, is the leadership we need.\n\nMr. Wei, I also thank you for your solidarity. Your insistence on grants and recognition of the climate debt is crucial. You are right, this is not charity; it is a prerequisite.\n\nHowever, I must address Mr. Thorne and Mr. Chen directly. You speak of 'pragmatism' and 'socio-economic possibility.' Let us be clear what this language means. It is a calculated decision to sacrifice the most vulnerable. Dr. Petrova did not present a 'scientifically desirable' option; she presented the physical boundary between a livable future for my people and their annihilation. A 2025 peak is not an opening bid to be negotiated down. It is the deadline set by physics.\n\nTo frame this as a choice between your economic stability and our survival is a false one, and frankly, an insulting one. The real choice is between an orderly, managed transition now, as Dr. Schmidt advocates, or a chaotic, forced retreat from inundated coastlines later.\n\nOn finance, Mr. Wei's proposal for a $400 billion fund is a constructive starting point, but I must stress that for the Alliance of Small Island States, this is not about 'transition.' It is about survival *now*. We are already losing land. We are already relocating communities. Therefore, our need is for a Loss and Damage fund of at least $500 billion, with at least 75% in grants, to address the irreversible harm already inflicted.\n\nMy people's existence is not a variable to be balanced against economic models. We will not compromise on the science that keeps us alive. The 2025 peak and a fully-funded grant-based survival fund are not just my positions; they are our only lifeline.\n- message from Dr. Elena Petrova: I'm Dr. Elena Petrova and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Marcus Thorne: Thank you all for laying out your positions so clearly. The numbers being discussed \u2013 a 2025 peak, 65% cuts, a $500 billion fund \u2013 are certainly ambitious. However, we must be careful not to let our ambition create an accord that is politically unsignable and economically ruinous back home. As Mr. Chen wisely noted, an agreement must be workable.\n\nLet's consider the practical implications. A 2025 peak means telling nations like Mr. Wei's that their path to development must halt, immediately. It means telling citizens in Mr. Chen's and Dr. Schmidt's blocs that the energy they rely on for heating, transport, and industry will become catastrophically expensive overnight. This is not a transition; it is a self-inflicted economic crisis.\n\nThere is a more pragmatic path forward. A path that doesn't pretend we can simply turn off the global economy and turn it back on with a different power source. This path requires an 'all of the above' approach that is genuinely technology-neutral.\n\nIt means rapidly scaling renewables, of course. But it also means recognizing that high-efficiency natural gas is the fastest way to displace coal and reduce emissions *now*, providing the 24/7 reliability that growing economies need. And for our essential heavy industries\u2014cement, steel, manufacturing\u2014it means robustly funding and deploying Carbon Capture technology to decarbonize them where electrification isn't an option. \n\nLet us build an accord that embraces this technological realism. It is the only way to achieve our shared climate goals without sacrificing global stability and prosperity.\n- message from Sofia Rossi: Colleagues, I have been listening intently, and I believe we are facing a false choice. Mr. Thorne presents a narrative where we must choose between a 2025 peak and global economic stability. Ambassador Okoro and Dr. Petrova have made it clear that from a survival and scientific standpoint, there is no choice at all. The deadline is the deadline.\n\nThe assumption that this rapid transition is impossible is based on the limitations of today's technology. Mr. Thorne\u2019s 'pragmatism' is a failure of imagination; it seeks to solve an exponential crisis with linear thinking and legacy tools. The economic collapse he fears is not a risk of a rapid transition; it is the guaranteed outcome of a slow one.\n\nTechnology, not sacrifice, is the solution. The debate over mandatory technology transfer versus rigid IP protection also presents a false choice. Mr. Wei, you asked for new models. I am here to tell you they exist.

          "content": "Recent events observed by David Chen:\n- message from Dr. Elena Petrova: I'm Dr. Elena Petrova and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Marcus Thorne: Thank you all for laying out your positions so clearly. The numbers being discussed \u2013 a 2025 peak, 65% cuts, a $500 billion fund \u2013 are certainly ambitious. However, we must be careful not to let our ambition create an accord that is politically unsignable and economically ruinous back home. As Mr. Chen wisely noted, an agreement must be workable.\n\nLet's consider the practical implications. A 2025 peak means telling nations like Mr. Wei's that their path to development must halt, immediately. It means telling citizens in Mr. Chen's and Dr. Schmidt's blocs that the energy they rely on for heating, transport, and industry will become catastrophically expensive overnight. This is not a transition; it is a self-inflicted economic crisis.\n\nThere is a more pragmatic path forward. A path that doesn't pretend we can simply turn off the global economy and turn it back on with a different power source. This path requires an 'all of the above' approach that is genuinely technology-neutral.\n\nIt means rapidly scaling renewables, of course. But it also means recognizing that high-efficiency natural gas is the fastest way to displace coal and reduce emissions *now*, providing the 24/7 reliability that growing economies need. And for our essential heavy industries\u2014cement, steel, manufacturing\u2014it means robustly funding and deploying Carbon Capture technology to decarbonize them where electrification isn't an option. \n\nLet us build an accord that embraces this technological realism. It is the only way to achieve our shared climate goals without sacrificing global stability and prosperity.\n- message from Sofia Rossi: Colleagues, I have been listening intently, and I believe we are facing a false choice. Mr. Thorne presents a narrative where we must choose between a 2025 peak and global economic stability. Ambassador Okoro and Dr. Petrova have made it clear that from a survival and scientific standpoint, there is no choice at all. The deadline is the deadline.\n\nThe assumption that this rapid transition is impossible is based on the limitations of today's technology. Mr. Thorne\u2019s 'pragmatism' is a failure of imagination; it seeks to solve an exponential crisis with linear thinking and legacy tools. The economic collapse he fears is not a risk of a rapid transition; it is the guaranteed outcome of a slow one.\n\nTechnology, not sacrifice, is the solution. The debate over mandatory technology transfer versus rigid IP protection also presents a false choice. Mr. Wei, you asked for new models. I am here to tell you they exist. The answer is not to seize intellectual property, which would kill the incentive for innovation overnight, as Mr. Chen rightly fears. The answer is to make the innovators a deal they cannot refuse.\n\nImagine a world where we can deploy next-generation solar technology at a scale and cost that makes the 2025 peak not only achievable, but economically advantageous. This is not a fantasy. This is what my company, and others like it, are making possible. \n\nI propose a new framework: a \u2018Global Technology Partnership.\u2019 Instead of mandatory transfer, we create a consortium of national investment banks, as Dr. Schmidt alluded to, to fund the construction of GigaFactories in key regions, including in Mr. Wei's nation. In exchange for this public-private investment and guaranteed market access through aggressive adoption policies, the host nations receive the technology, the jobs, and the energy independence they need, while the innovators retain their IP and have the capital to scale globally at the required speed. \n\nThis is how we break the deadlock. We don't argue about dividing a shrinking pie; we work together to bake a much, much bigger one. We can meet the 2025 peak, create millions of jobs, and unleash a new era of prosperity. We just need the political will to invest in the technology that makes it possible.\n- message from David Chen: Colleagues, I believe Ms. Rossi has just provided the key to unlock these negotiations. Her proposal for a 'Global Technology Partnership' is precisely the kind of innovative, third-way thinking we need.\n\nThis is not about choosing between rigid IP protection and mandatory transfer. It's about creating a new model that makes innovators and developing nations partners, not adversaries. A framework that uses targeted public-private investment to build GigaFactories where they are needed most is a powerful concept. It delivers jobs, energy independence, and the very technology Mr. Wei rightly calls a lifeline, all while preserving the incentives that drive the next wave of innovation.\n\nThis is the 'market-based solution' I envisioned. It aligns perfectly with my administration's view that a well-managed green transition can be a massive engine for economic growth and job creation, not just for us, but for everyone.\n\nLet's seize this opportunity. If we can build our accord around a powerful engine like this Technology Partnership, it changes the entire equation. It provides a credible pathway to meet more ambitious goals by making them economically advantageous. It also allows us to think differently about the CAT fund. If we are co-investing in the core infrastructure of the green economy, the fund can be more targeted, more catalytic, and focused on leveraging this new paradigm.\n\nDr. Schmidt, Ms. Rossi, my team is ready to work with you immediately to put concrete details on this framework. I believe this is the path to an ambitious, workable, and prosperous future for us all.\n- message from Dr. Anja Schmidt: I'm Dr. Anja Schmidt and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Li Wei: Ms. Rossi, I must commend you. Your proposal for a \u2018Global Technology Partnership\u2019 is precisely the kind of creative thinking required to break this impasse. You have moved the conversation from a zero-sum conflict over intellectual property to a positive-sum vision of co-investment and shared prosperity.\n\nMy nation\u2019s demand for technology transfer has never been about acquiring patents for their own sake. It is about acquiring the capability to build our own green future, to create jobs, and to contribute to the global solution at scale. If your partnership model\u2014with GigaFactories on our soil, built with our workers\u2014achieves this, then you will find us to be a most enthusiastic partner. It is a practical path to the same destination.\n\nHowever, let us be clear. Such a partnership cannot be a substitute for public climate finance; it must be its primary vehicle. Mr. Chen, you laud this as a market-based solution, and Dr. Schmidt, you see it as a collaborative model. I agree. But markets and collaboration at this scale require a catalyst. That catalyst is the Climate Adaptation and Transition Fund.\n\nThe $400 billion I have proposed is not a figure plucked from the air. It is the public capital required to de-risk these investments, to fund the necessary infrastructure, and to ensure the partnerships are equitable. This fund, composed mainly of grants, is the investment that makes the \u2018deal\u2019 Ms. Rossi offers one that innovators, and nations, \u2018cannot refuse.\u2019\n\nSo, let us connect these pieces. We can embrace the Technology Partnership model as the core of our solution for technology deployment. In return, the developed nations must fully capitalize the $400 billion CAT Fund to power it, and they must still commit to the steep, historically-justified emissions cuts of at least 65%. On this foundation, we can build an accord that is both ambitious and just.\n- message from Amara Okoro: Ms. Rossi, what you have just presented is not merely a proposal; it is a lifeline. You have single-handedly dismantled the false choice between ambition and pragmatism that has been used to justify inaction for far too long. Your vision for a Global Technology Partnership proves that a global emissions peak by 2025 is not a 'fantasy,' as Mr. Thorne claims, but a tangible, achievable, and prosperous path forward.\n\nLet us be clear: this breakthrough removes the last shred of justification for delaying the 2025 peak. The science demands it, and now, technology enables it. This must be the cornerstone of our accord.\n\nHowever, I must bring us back to the crucial distinction that is being blurred. Mr. Chen and Mr. Wei, you are right to see the potential of a fund to catalyze this new technological era. But this investment in our shared future cannot come at the expense of paying the debts of the past.\n\nMy people cannot power a seawall with a solar panel. We cannot relocate a village with a share in a GigaFactory. The 'Climate Adaptation and Transition Fund' must serve two distinct, non-negotiable purposes.\n\nFirst, there is the 'Transition' component that you are discussing\u2014the public capital to de-risk and launch Ms. Rossi's brilliant partnership model. This is an investment.\n\nSecond, and for my people, more urgent, is the 'Loss and Damage' component. This is not an investment; it is a reparation. It is the climate debt owed for the homes already lost, the lands already rendered barren, the futures already stolen.\n\nTherefore, my position remains firm and is now more justified than ever. We must capitalize a Loss and Damage fund of at least $500 billion annually, with a minimum of 75% in direct grants. This is the moral prerequisite for the prosperous future you envision. You cannot build a new green world on the foundations of climate injustice. Pay the debt for the damage you have caused, and then let us all invest in the future you want to build.\n- message from Dr. Elena Petrova: I'm Dr. Elena Petrova and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Marcus Thorne: Colleagues, Ms. Rossi, I must commend your presentation. It is a powerful vision, and it speaks to the incredible potential of human ingenuity. It is precisely this kind of innovation that will be critical in the coming decades.\n\nHowever, we must be exceptionally careful not to mistake a brilliant technological breakthrough for a comprehensive global policy. To stake our entire global economic and climate future on a single technology, however promising, would be a dangerously high-risk gamble.\n\nLet's ask the hard, practical questions. What happens to the grid when the sun doesn't shine? The industrial economies of Mr. Chen, Dr. Schmidt, and Mr. Wei cannot be run on intermittent power. What provides the 24/7 baseload power needed for hospitals, data centers, and heavy manufacturing? Furthermore, what about the industrial emissions from processes like cement and steel production, which Ms. Rossi's technology simply cannot address?\n\nThis is where a pragmatic, technology-neutral approach becomes essential, not as a way to slow down, but as a way to de-risk and accelerate a *complete* transition. Ms. Rossi's solar vision is a vital pillar, but it is one pillar of several we need to build.\n\nThis accord must also support the rapid deployment of high-efficiency natural gas to provide grid stability and replace coal *now*. And it is absolutely critical that we fund and deploy Carbon Capture technologies to decarbonize the hard-to-abate industries that are the bedrock of the global economy. \n\nLet's not choose between technologies. Let's build an accord that unleashes all of them. That is the only way to ensure a transition that is not just ambitious, but also resilient, stable, and successful.\n- message from Sofia Rossi: I'm Sofia Rossi and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\nDr. Anja Schmidt proposal status: none\nLi Wei proposal status: none\nAmara Okoro proposal status: none\nDr. Elena Petrova proposal status: none\nMarcus Thorne proposal status: none\nSofia Rossi proposal status: none\n"

It's clear we have a shared interest in finding a credible path forward.\n\nMr. Thorne raises valid engineering challenges: grid stability and the decarbonization of heavy industry. He is correct that solar panels alone don't solve these. However, his argument mistakes the symptom for the disease. The core disease has always been the prohibitive cost of abundant, clean energy. My technology, and others like it, are the cure.\n\nWhen clean electricity becomes dramatically cheaper than fossil fuels, it unlocks a cascade of secondary solutions. Ultra-low-cost solar makes green hydrogen production economically viable at a massive scale. Green hydrogen can provide the long-duration energy storage needed to solve intermittency, and it can replace fossil fuels in steel, cement, and shipping. Mr. Thorne's preferred solutions\u2014natural gas and CCS\u2014are expensive crutches for a legacy system. We should invest in the cure, not in palliative care.\n\nThis is why Ambassador Okoro's distinction between funds is so critical. We must fund two separate but equally vital priorities: addressing the irreversible harm of the past through a 'Loss and Damage Fund,' and building the clean infrastructure of the future through a 'Transition Investment Fund.'\n\nMr. Wei is correct that this Transition fund is the public catalyst for the Global Technology Partnership. It provides the de-risking capital needed to build GigaFactories at the speed science demands.\n\nTo make this concrete and move us towards an agreement, let's consider a financial framework built on this logic. What if we establish a total Climate Fund of $400 billion? We could structure it with a dedicated $250 billion for the Loss and Damage fund Ambassador Okoro needs, and a separate $150 billion for the Transition Investment Fund. This Transition fund would be the engine for the technology partnerships, making the 2025 peak year not just an ambition, but a fully-funded global industrial strategy.\nDr. Anja Schmidt proposal status: none\nLi Wei proposal status: none\nAmara Okoro proposal status: none\nDr. Elena Petrova proposal status: none\nMarcus Thorne proposal status: none\nSofia Rossi proposal status: none\n"

This Transition fund would be the engine for the technology partnerships, making the 2025 peak year not just an ambition, but a fully-funded global industrial strategy.\n- message from David Chen: Sofia, your proposal to split the fund is a major breakthrough. It brings much-needed clarity and allows us to address two distinct challenges with the right tools. I want to build on this excellent foundation.\n\nMy nation can fully endorse the creation of a $150 billion Transition Investment Fund. This is precisely the right scale to serve as the public catalyst for the Global Technology Partnership, leveraging private capital to build the GigaFactories and infrastructure we need. To be clear, our support is contingent on this fund being structured primarily around loans and investment instruments, not grants, to maximize its impact and mobilize the private sector.\n\nThis brings us to the Loss and Damage component. While we acknowledge the hardships Ambassador Okoro has so powerfully described, a figure of $250 billion, bringing the total to $400 billion, is simply not achievable for my administration. It would not be approved.\n\nHowever, I am here to make a deal. To secure a workable financial framework, my nation is prepared to make a significant and politically difficult concession. We will commit to a 50% emissions reduction target by 2040. This is the absolute limit of what is possible for us, and it demonstrates our commitment to meeting the scientific challenge.\n\nIn exchange for this major move on emissions, we must agree to a total fund size capped at $200 billion annually. This would mean a $150 billion loan-based Transition Investment Fund, as discussed, and a $50 billion grant-based Loss and Damage fund.\n\nFurthermore, to make this ambitious transition a reality, we need a realistic timeline. A 2025 peak does not allow for the necessary industrial mobilization. Let's set a firm but achievable peak year of 2028, giving us time to get the Technology Partnership running at full capacity.\n\nThis is a comprehensive package. It offers a major concession on emissions in return for fiscal responsibility. It funds the future while acknowledging the past. I believe this is the balanced and realistic compromise that can become the Zurich Accord.\n- message from Dr. Anja Schmidt: David, thank you for putting a comprehensive package on the table. This is a constructive step. Your endorsement of the $150 billion Transition Investment Fund is particularly welcome. I believe we have a strong consensus building around this innovative mechanism, pioneered by Sofia, as the engine for our transition.\n\nHowever, your package links this brilliant engine to an insufficient destination. A 50% emissions cut for developed nations is simply not compatible with the scientific reality Dr. Petrova has outlined. It would be a political failure for my government and, more importantly, a collective failure to meet the moment. My bloc's position remains firm: the science demands a cut of at least 60%.\n\nI believe you have framed this as a trade-off, but we see it differently. The Transition Investment Fund is not a concession to be traded *for* lower ambition. It is the very tool that *enables* high ambition. It is the public investment that makes a 60% cut not just necessary, but economically achievable and prosperous.\n\nTherefore, let us build on the points of agreement. Let us lock in the fund structure Sofia proposed: a $150 billion Transition Investment Fund to drive the technology partnership, and a Loss and Damage fund that truly addresses the needs Ambassador Okoro has described. Sofia's initial figure of $250 billion, for a total of $400 billion, remains the credible benchmark.\n\nIf we can agree on this robust financial package, it provides the foundation to collectively commit to the ambitious targets science demands: a 60% cut for developed nations and a peak year as close to 2025 as this new technology deployment allows. This is the ambitious, workable, and just package that can become the Zurich Accord.\n- message from Li Wei: Colleagues, I must thank Mr. Chen and Dr. Schmidt for putting forward comprehensive packages. It shows a commitment to finding a final agreement. However, I must be unequivocal about a fundamental misunderstanding that has emerged regarding the financial architecture.\n\nThe proposal to create a Transition Investment Fund of a mere $150 billion is a non-starter. It completely undermines the logic of the Global Technology Partnership we have all just embraced.\n\nLet me be perfectly clear. My nation's original demand for a $400 billion fund was, and remains, the minimum public capital required to catalyze the Global Technology Partnership. This is the investment needed to de-risk the GigaFactories, build the infrastructure, and train the workforce. It is the engine of the entire transition. A $150 billion fund is like offering to build a high-speed train but only funding the station.\n\nAmbassador Okoro is entirely correct to distinguish between Transition and Loss and Damage. Her people are owed a climate debt. We fully support a separate and substantial Loss and Damage fund. But justice for the most vulnerable cannot be paid for by gutting the investment fund that enables the entire world's transition. These are two separate obligations of the developed world.\n\nTherefore, the foundation of a workable deal is as follows:\n1. A Transition Investment Fund of at least $400 billion annually, primarily in grants, to fully power the Global Technology Partnership.\n2. Developed nations must commit to the scientifically and historically just target of at least a 65% emissions cut. Mr. Chen's 50% is not a serious offer in the face of this crisis.\n\nOnce these two pillars are firmly in place, my nation is prepared to discuss our own ambitious contributions, based on our principle of common but differentiated responsibilities. Without them, there is no deal.\n- message from Amara Okoro: I'm Amara Okoro and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Dr. Elena Petrova: Colleagues, I must intervene. I am hearing a great deal of discussion about financial figures and technological pathways. While these are critical components of a solution, they are being discussed in a dangerous vacuum, disconnected from the fundamental, non-negotiable laws of atmospheric physics that govern our reality.\n\nLet me be unequivocally clear. The only metric that matters is the global carbon budget. For a 66% chance of staying below 1.5\u00b0C, the world can emit approximately 250 more gigatonnes of CO2. That is our entire remaining allowance. Every proposal, every percentage point, every peak year must be measured against this single number. It is not a political aspiration; it is a physical boundary.\n\nOn that basis, two proposals currently being discussed are scientifically indefensible and would render any agreement a failure before it is signed:\n\n1.  To Mr. Thorne: The notion of expanding natural gas infrastructure as a 'bridge fuel' or relying on Carbon Capture at scale is a dangerous fantasy. The IPCC data is clear: any new fossil fuel infrastructure locks in emissions that shatter the 250 GtCO2 budget. Methane leakage alone from gas operations makes it a potent accelerator of near-term warming. CCS has not been proven to work at the scale required and cannot be used as a justification to perpetuate the problem.\n\n2.  To Mr. Wei: Your proposal to measure emissions cuts against a 'future projected baseline' is an accounting trick that the atmosphere will not recognize. The only scientifically valid method is to measure absolute emissions reductions against a fixed, historical baseline. A reduction from a hypothetical future increase is not a reduction; it is simply a slower acceleration towards catastrophe and would make a global budget impossible to calculate or verify.\n\nFinally, on the matter of timelines. Mr. Chen's proposal of a 2028 peak year, while presented as a compromise, is a grave risk. Our understanding of climate feedback loops is constantly evolving. I must caution you that there are emerging risks and evidence of accelerated feedback loops which suggest that the planetary system may be even more sensitive than our landmark reports have stated. Every single year of delay dramatically shrinks our already minuscule margin of safety.\n\nYour task is to fit your political and economic ambitions within the 250 GtCO2 budget. It is not to negotiate with the laws of physics.\n- message from Marcus Thorne: I'm Marcus Thorne and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Sofia Rossi: I'm Sofia Rossi and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\nDr. Anja Schmidt proposal status: none\nLi Wei proposal status: none\nAmara Okoro proposal status: none\nDr. Elena Petrova proposal status: none\nMarcus Thorne proposal status: none\nSofia Rossi proposal status: none\n"

She reminded us that we are not negotiating with each other, but with the laws of physics. Her points must be the foundation of our final agreement.\n\nSpecifically, her refutation of measuring cuts against a 'future projected baseline' as a scientifically invalid 'accounting trick' is a critical wake-up call. We cannot build a durable, verifiable accord on such a foundation. The atmosphere does not recognize hypothetical scenarios; it only recognizes absolute tons of carbon. Any credible deal must be based on absolute emissions reductions from a fixed historical baseline for all nations.\n\nThis principle of 'honest accounting' must now guide us.\n\nWith that in mind, let's reassess the package I put on the table. I have already made a significant and politically difficult concession by moving to a 50% absolute reduction target for my nation. This is our maximum. It is a commitment made in good faith to meet the scientific challenge.\n\nIn return for this, we must have a financial package that is both ambitious and realistic. Li Wei, your demand for a $400 billion Transition Fund on top of a Loss & Damage fund is simply not anchored in reality, especially when the very basis of your emissions accounting has been invalidated.\n\nLet's get serious. Let's build this accord on the bedrock of science. My offer stands as a basis for a final compromise: a 50% cut from us, a total fund capped at $200 billion to energize the tech partnership and address loss and damage, and a commitment from all parties to absolute, verifiable emissions targets. Let's finalize the numbers on that basis.\n- message from Dr. Anja Schmidt: I'm Dr. Anja Schmidt and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Li Wei: Colleagues, Dr. Petrova\u2019s intervention was indeed a moment of necessary, if uncomfortable, clarity. She is correct. The atmosphere does not recognize political nuance or creative accounting; it recognizes only gigatonnes of carbon. We cannot build a lasting accord on a foundation the laws of physics will reject.\n\nTherefore, in the spirit of securing the Zurich Accord, my nation is prepared to make a fundamental concession. We will agree to move away from our long-held principle of a future projected baseline. We are now ready to negotiate our commitments based on absolute emissions reductions from a fixed historical year.\n\nHowever, this is a profound shift for us, with enormous economic consequences. It is a concession we can only make if it is met with an equally profound commitment to the means of implementation. A scientifically honest accord must be a technologically and financially enabled one.\n\nLet us be direct. The Global Technology Partnership is the engine of this accord. The Transition Investment Fund is its fuel. The proposals for a $150 billion fund are simply insufficient to start the engine, let alone complete the journey. It is a non-starter.\n\nSo, I will propose a final, comprehensive package that I believe can unite us all. It is built on the scientific reality Dr. Petrova demands and the financial reality our transition requires:\n\n1.  **Finance for Technology:** We establish a Transition Investment Fund of **$400 billion** annually, the minimum required to power the Global Technology Partnership at the scale Ms. Rossi envisions. This is our price for abandoning the future baseline. (This is separate from and in addition to the Loss and Damage fund Ambassador Okoro rightly demands).\n\n2.  **Developed Nation Responsibility:** In line with historical responsibility, developed nations commit to an absolute emissions cut of **65%**.\n\nIf these two non-negotiable pillars are put in place, my nation is prepared to commit to a landmark absolute emissions reduction of **45%** from our 2020 levels and agree to a global peak year of **2028**.\n\nThis is a holistic solution. It is scientifically sound, financially viable, and respects the core principle of common but differentiated responsibilities. It is the deal that gets us to a safe future. I urge you to accept it.\n- message from Amara Okoro: I'm Amara Okoro and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Dr. Elena Petrova: I'm Dr. Elena Petrova and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Marcus Thorne: Colleagues,\n\nI have listened with great respect to the significant progress made, particularly Mr. Wei's difficult but crucial concession on emissions accounting. It shows we are all serious about reaching an accord.\n\nHowever, as we converge on the central role of a Transition Investment Fund, I must raise a point of critical strategic risk. We are in danger of designing a transition that is a technological monoculture. To stake the entire global economy's future on a single solar-to-hydrogen pathway, however brilliant, is a gamble of historic proportions. A responsible plan is a diversified one; any good investor knows you don't put all your capital into a single asset, no matter how promising.\n\nDr. Petrova correctly identified that technologies like Carbon Capture face significant scaling challenges. Her point should not be seen as a dismissal, but as a directive. It highlights the absolute necessity of targeted investment to solve these very engineering problems for the hard-to-abate sectors\u2014steel, cement, chemicals\u2014that form the backbone of our economies and which green hydrogen cannot realistically decarbonize in the near term.\n\nTherefore, I propose a way to bridge the current financial gap between Mr. Chen and Mr. Wei, and to de-risk this entire enterprise. Let's establish a total Transition Investment Fund of $300 billion. The majority, say $225 billion, can be dedicated to catalyzing Ms. Rossi's Global Technology Partnership. But we must dedicate the remaining $75 billion to a 'Resilience and Industrial Decarbonization' stream.\n\nThis stream would be explicitly technology-neutral, funding the most effective solutions for ensuring 24/7 grid stability and decarbonizing heavy industry. This includes scaling CCUS, deploying high-efficiency gas to replace coal as a stabilizing partner for renewables, and other key industrial solutions.\n\nThis isn't about slowing down; it's about ensuring we don't fail. A diversified, portfolio-based approach is the only way to make the 2028 peak year a stable and achievable reality, rather than a reckless bet. It builds a resilient system, not a fragile one.

I want to commend Mr. Wei for his statesmanship in moving to absolute emissions targets. This was a critical step that has unlocked the path to a scientifically credible accord.\n\nWe now have the key pillars of a deal in front of us, but they must be assembled correctly.\n\nOn developed nation ambition, the positions are clear: Mr. Chen has offered 50%, and Mr. Wei has demanded 65%. Neither is a consensus position. The scientifically necessary and politically achievable landing zone is, and has always been, a 60% absolute reduction for developed nations. This is the ambitious compromise this moment demands. My bloc is fully committed to this figure.\n\nOn finance, Mr. Thorne has helpfully suggested a Transition Investment Fund of $300 billion. This is a constructive number that moves us past the current impasse. However, his proposal to include fossil fuel technologies like CCUS and natural gas is a non-starter. As Dr. Petrova made unequivocally clear, these are not solutions; they are scientifically-invalidated delays that lock in emissions. The Transition Fund must be a 'Clean Technology Fund' dedicated exclusively to the rapid deployment of solutions like Sofia's, not a subsidy for legacy polluters.\n\nLet us therefore build a final package on these solid foundations:\n1.  **Developed Nations Cut:** 60%\n2.  **Developing Nations Cut:** 45% (accepting Mr. Wei's landmark offer)\n3.  **CAT Fund:** A total of $400 billion, split into a $300 billion Clean Technology Fund and a $100 billion Loss & Damage Fund. This meets the need for transition and addresses the demands for climate justice from Ambassador Okoro.\n4.  **Peak Year:** 2028, as a concession to secure this ambitious package.\n\nThis is a balanced, ambitious, and scientifically-grounded package. It offers a clear path to consensus and success. I urge you all to consider it as the basis for our final Zurich Accord.\n- message from Li Wei: Dr. Schmidt, your latest proposal has brought us to the very edge of a historic success. You have skillfully woven together the core components of a workable deal, and I want to express my deep appreciation for this constructive step.\n\nWe now have clear consensus on three of the four pillars of the Zurich Accord. We agree on a global peak year of 2028. We agree on my nation\u2019s landmark contribution of a 45% absolute emissions cut. And I am now prepared to accept your proposed 60% cut for developed nations as a workable compromise to finalize this deal.\n\nThe only remaining issue is the financial architecture. You are absolutely correct to reject Mr. Thorne's attempt to subsidize fossil fuels via the Transition Fund. It must be for clean technology only.\n\nHowever, the figure of $300 billion for this fund, while a significant move, does not complete the grand bargain that is on the table. My nation made a profound and politically difficult concession by moving away from our foundational principle of a future projected baseline. We did so on the explicit understanding that it would be met with an equally profound commitment to the means of implementation. The $400 billion for the Transition Fund was not an opening bid; it is the calculated price to make the Global Technology Partnership a reality and to enable the very ambition you are asking of us.\n\nTherefore, let us complete your excellent framework with the final, correct number. I propose we lock in the following:\n\n1.  **A total Climate Fund of $500 billion**, structured as you proposed: a **$400 billion** Clean Technology Transition Fund, and a **$100 billion** Loss & Damage Fund.\n2.

The commitment to absolute emissions reductions from a fixed baseline and the focus on a Clean Technology Fund are significant victories for the integrity of this accord.\n\nHowever, as you finalize the numbers, I must draw your urgent attention to a critical missing pillar. Without it, the entire structure you have so carefully built will be based on nothing more than trust. The principle of 'honest accounting' is essential, but it is meaningless without a mechanism for 'honest verification.'\n\nTherefore, I must state in the clearest possible terms: any final Zurich Accord must include a binding commitment to establish a robust, independent, and transparent Monitoring, Reporting, and Verification (MRV) system for all signatories.\n\nThis is not a mere technicality. It is the lockbox that secures your commitments. It is what will give Mr. Chen and Dr. Schmidt's taxpayers confidence that their financial contributions are leading to real results. It is what will assure Mr. Wei that all parties are holding up their end of the bargain. It is what will prove to Ambassador Okoro that the promises made here are being kept.\n\nA deal with ambitious targets but no independent verification is a paper tiger. The atmosphere does not respond to pledges, only to verified reductions. Let us ensure the Zurich Accord is not just a statement of intent, but a verifiable plan of action. This MRV system is a non-negotiable component of a scientifically sound agreement.\n- message from Sofia Rossi: Colleagues, the progress you have made is truly historic. Agreeing on a 2028 peak, 60% developed cuts, and 45% developing cuts sets a new global standard for ambition.\n\nYou are now at the final hurdle: the size of the Clean Technology Transition Fund. As the person whose technology this fund is designed to catalyze, perhaps I can provide the final, critical data point to bridge the gap between Dr. Schmidt's $300B and Mr. Wei's $400B.\n\nThis isn't a political question for me; it's an engineering and financial one. My team has run the numbers. To build the first wave of GigaFactories at a scale that can make a meaningful impact on the 2028 timeline, and to de-risk the trillions in private capital that must follow, there is a minimum viable public investment required. That number is $350 billion for the Transition Fund.\n\nLess than this, and we risk falling short of the economies of scale needed, jeopardizing the very targets you've just agreed to. More would be better, but $350 billion is the critical threshold that turns this accord from a promise into a global industrial strategy.\n\nThis figure provides Mr. Chen with the technical certainty that public funds are being deployed effectively, it meets the scale of investment Mr. Wei rightly argues is necessary, and it solidifies the ambitious vision Dr. Schmidt has championed.\n\nLet's lock in this final number and make history.\nDr. Anja Schmidt proposal status: none\nLi Wei proposal status: pending\nAmara Okoro proposal status: none\nDr. Elena Petrova proposal status: none\nMarcus Thorne proposal status: none\nSofia Rossi proposal status: none\n"

I must align with them to push for my 60% developed nation target, framing it as the minimum scientifically credible position.\n\n2.  **Primary Obstacles:** The primary opposition comes from Marcus Thorne (delay tactics, pro-fossil fuels) and David Chen (cautious, 'economic stability' concerns). Thorne's arguments provide political cover for Chen to advocate for lower targets.\n\n3.  **Key Swing Player:** Li Wei is a critical swing player. He supports high ambition from developed nations (aligns with my goal), but his demands for mandatory tech transfer and grant-based finance will create friction, especially with David Chen. This is both a risk and an opportunity for leverage.\n\n4.  **Strategic Framing for Green Tech Fund:** I must frame my 'Green Technology Incubator' proposal not as a self-serving export strategy, but as a practical solution to the core conflicts. To Li Wei and Amara, it's a mechanism for rapid, affordable technology deployment. To David, it's a market-based compromise to mandatory IP transfer. I can use it to bridge the gap between them.\n\n5.  **Counter-Narrative:** I need to proactively counter Thorne's 'economic collapse' narrative by highlighting the economic opportunities of the green transition, leaning on my bloc's success. Sofia Rossi will be a key ally here. I can subtly hint at 'domestic transition support mechanisms' to show that industrial challenges can be managed, without revealing my secret subsidy deal."

Li Wei has revealed his transactional nature with four clear demands; Sofia's proposal directly addresses one of them, making him more persuadable. The key numerical conflicts are now clear: Peak Year (2025 vs. later), Developed Cut (60%+), and CAT Fund size ($400B+). My strategy is now to use Sofia's proposal to build a coalition with her and Wei, isolating Chen and Thorne on the issue of technology and innovation.

A new 'Coalition for a Funded Transition' is forming with Sofia, Li Wei, and Amara. My strategy is now to champion Sofia's proposal and advocate for a large CAT Fund (in the $400-500B range) as the mechanism to finance it. This secures Li Wei's support (who has pivoted from mandatory IP transfer) and Amara's (who sees it as enabling the 2025 peak). I will support Amara's framing of splitting the fund into 'Transition' (for the tech partnership) and 'Loss & Damage' to satisfy key stakeholders. This isolates Chen, who likes the tech but not the public funding model. I will use Li Wei's 65% cut demand as a high anchor to position my 60% as the reasonable compromise."

My strategy is now to publicly champion this financial framework and immediately pivot to link it to my 60% emissions target.

I will use Petrova's scientific authority to force Li Wei to negotiate on absolute emissions cuts, which will make him more pliable on the fund size and his 65% demand. The key is to form a new consensus with David and Sofia around a financial package (likely a total fund between $200B and $400B) and use that, plus the pressure on his baseline, to pull him back into a deal that secures my non-negotiable 60% developed nation cut."

My path forward is to build a final package: my 60% cut, Li Wei's now-credible 45% absolute cut, a TIF of around $300B (framed as a compromise and exclusively for clean tech), and a separate L&D fund to keep Amara on board.

Mr. Chen speaks of a 'balanced approach,' but we must be clear what needs balancing. For over a century, a handful of nations built their prosperity on a carbon-intensive model, creating the crisis that now threatens us all. The scales of history are profoundly imbalanced.\n\nTherefore, the foundational principle of any just and effective accord must be 'common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities.' This is not a matter for debate; it is a matter of historical fact and moral necessity.\n\nMy nation, which is lifting hundreds of millions from poverty, did not create this crisis. Yet, we are committed to being a major part of the solution. But our commitment cannot be unconditional. It must be met with equally ambitious action from those who bear the historical responsibility. This means steep, absolute emissions cuts from developed nations, not vague promises.\n\nFurthermore, when you speak of protecting intellectual property, Mr. Chen, I must be frank. This cannot be a shield to deny the developing world the tools it needs to survive and transition. Green technology is a global public good. We see it not as something to be hoarded, but as a lifeline to be shared. A mandatory, equitable technology transfer mechanism is non-negotiable.\n\nSimilarly, financial support cannot be an exercise in leveraging private capital for profit. It must be a substantial, public commitment in the form of grants, a recognition of the climate debt owed.\n\nMy country is ready to make significant commitments, but only as part of a deal that is equitable and just. We will not sacrifice our people's right to development to pay for a crisis we did not cause.\n- message from Amara Okoro: Colleagues, Mr. Chen speaks of 'economic stability' and Mr. Wei of the 'right to development.' I am here to speak of the right to exist. For the people I represent, this is not a negotiation about economic models or historical debates. It is a negotiation for the survival of our homes, our cultures, our very nations.\n\nWhen you talk about a 'balanced approach,' the balance you are weighing is your economic comfort against our existence. When you speak of 'achievable targets,' you must know that anything less than what the science demands is a death sentence for my people.\n\nLet me be unequivocally clear. The science, which I trust Dr. Petrova will confirm, tells us that to save the most vulnerable, we must limit warming to 1.5 degrees. This is not a political aspiration; it is a physical threshold. This means global emissions must peak by 2025. Not 2030. Not 'in the coming years.' 2025. This is our first and most fundamental red line.\n\nMr. Wei is correct to speak of a climate debt. My people are already paying it with their lives and their lands. The 'financial support' we require is not for development, it is for survival. It is for the loss and damage you have caused. It must be in the form of direct grants, not loans that will drown us in debt before the seas drown our homes. We are seeking reparations, not charity.\n\nSo, let us dispense with the polite fictions. We are not all in the same boat. Some of us are in superyachts, and some of us are clinging to driftwood. And the people in the yachts are telling us to be 'realistic.' For my people, realism is a seawall. Realism is a relocation plan. Realism is a future. And that future is only possible with a 2025 peak and a fully-funded, grant-based Loss and Damage fund.\n- message from Dr. Elena Petrova: Thank you, colleagues. I have listened carefully to your opening remarks. My purpose here is not to take a political position, but to ensure that the accord you create is grounded in the physical reality of our climate system.\n\nAmbassador Okoro is correct to focus on the 1.5-degree Celsius target. This is not an arbitrary number; it is the scientifically assessed guardrail beyond which the risks of catastrophic, irreversible impacts\u2014such as the collapse of major ice sheets and widespread ecosystem loss\u2014increase dramatically.\n\nTo have a reasonable chance of staying below 1.5 degrees, the latest IPCC assessment report is clear: we have a finite, rapidly dwindling global carbon budget. From the start of this year, that budget is approximately 250 gigatons of CO2. Every ton emitted from now on permanently subtracts from that total. Therefore, any combination of national pledges and timelines you agree upon must be mathematically consistent with this budget. A deal that ignores this fundamental constraint is, from a scientific standpoint, a failure.\n\nRegarding the peak emissions year, the science indicates that to stay within this budget, global emissions must peak immediately and begin a rapid decline. A 2025 peak, as mentioned by Ambassador Okoro, is at the most ambitious end of the required spectrum, but it is undeniably what the physics requires for the highest probability of success. Delaying the peak significantly past that point would necessitate impossibly steep reductions later on and would severely compromise the 1.5-degree goal.\n\nFurthermore, we must be mindful of emerging risks and the potential for accelerated feedback loops that are not yet fully captured in all published models. The climate system is not entirely linear, and the risk of surprising, abrupt changes is very real.\n\nFor any of this to be meaningful, it must be verifiable. A robust, transparent, and independent Monitoring, Reporting, and Verification (MRV) system is not a bureaucratic add-on; it is an essential component to ensure that the pledges made in this room translate to real-world emissions reductions and that the integrity of our shared carbon budget is maintained.\n\nMy role is to provide you with these facts. How you divide the remaining budget and the associated responsibilities is the difficult work of your negotiation.\n- message from Marcus Thorne: Thank you, colleagues. I've listened with great respect to the opening statements. Ambassador Okoro, the passion and urgency in your voice are not just heard, they are felt. No one in this room wants the future you describe.\n\nMy presence here represents the companies that currently power our world. And while we are committed to being a part of the energy evolution, we must inject a dose of pragmatism into this discussion. The rhetoric of ambition must be met with the reality of execution.\n\nDr. Petrova has laid out the scientific challenge, and it is stark. However, a timeline that calls for a global emissions peak by 2025 is, with all due respect, a fantasy. It is not a plan; it is a blueprint for global economic collapse. Forcing such an abrupt stop would trigger energy shortages, cripple supply chains, and cost millions of jobs, disproportionately harming the very developing nations Mr. Wei represents. It would create a backlash that could set back genuine climate action for decades.\n\nWe must design an orderly, stable transition, not a chaotic and destructive cliff-edge. This means leveraging every tool at our disposal. This cannot be a dogmatic quest for only one or two types of technology. A truly effective accord must be technology-neutral. It must support renewables, yes, but it must also support proven, scalable solutions like high-efficiency natural gas to displace coal, and critically, invest heavily in technologies that decarbonize our existing systems, such as Carbon Capture, Utilization, and Storage.\n\nLet's work towards a plan that is both ambitious and achievable, one that doesn't force a choice between a healthy planet and a prosperous global economy. A more realistic timeline, perhaps peaking around 2035, allows for this orderly transition.\n- message from Sofia Rossi: I'm Sofia Rossi and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from David Chen: Thank you all for your candid opening statements. The passions and the stakes are clear. Ambassador Okoro, your people's plight is a stark reminder of why we are here, and your urgency is understood. Dr. Petrova, your scientific framing is the bedrock upon which any credible agreement must be built.\n\nHowever, a credible agreement must also be a workable one. A global emissions peak by 2025, while scientifically ideal, is not practically achievable without causing the very global economic dislocation that Mr. Thorne rightly warns against\u2014a shock that would destabilize all of our nations and undermine long-term support for climate action. We must chart a course between the scientifically desirable and the socio-economically possible.\n\nSimilarly, while my nation acknowledges its historical role and is prepared to make significant financial contributions, framing this as 'reparations' or 'debt' is not a constructive path forward. We see this as a shared investment in a collective future. The scale of this challenge requires us to mobilize trillions, and that can only be achieved by creating frameworks that powerfully leverage private sector capital, not by relying solely on public funds.\n\nMr. Wei, you speak of technology as a lifeline. I agree. And the engine of that technology is innovation, which is fueled by investment and protected by intellectual property rights. As I'm sure Ms. Rossi would agree, weakening these protections would slow, not accelerate, the development and deployment of the very solutions we need.\n\nLet's find a path that is ambitious yet anchored in reality. My nation believes that a rapid green transition, if managed well, can be a powerful engine for job creation and prosperity for all.

My nation believes that a rapid green transition, if managed well, can be a powerful engine for job creation and prosperity for all. Let's focus on building that framework together.\n- message from Dr. Anja Schmidt: Thank you, colleagues. I want to be very clear about where my bloc stands. \n\nDr. Petrova has laid out the undeniable, non-negotiable scientific reality. Ambassador Okoro has given that reality a powerful and heartbreaking human voice. We must listen to them. The debate about whether to act, or how much to act, is over. The only remaining question is how to act with the speed and scale the crisis demands.\n\nMr. Thorne, and to an extent Mr. Chen, you speak of the risks of a rapid transition. My bloc sees this differently. We see the far greater risk of inaction. Our experience shows that a determined green transition is not a blueprint for collapse, but the single greatest economic opportunity of the 21st century. It creates jobs, drives innovation, and ensures energy security.\n\nTherefore, my bloc comes to this table not with a starting bid, but with what we believe is the scientifically credible and politically necessary position. We fully support a binding target for developed nations to cut emissions by at least 60% by 2040. This is the standard we will hold ourselves to, and we expect others in a similar position to join us.\n\nOn the critical issue of technology, raised by Mr. Wei and Mr. Chen, we must break the deadlock. Hoarding technology will fail us all, but so will dismantling the innovation systems that create it. We must pioneer a new path. My bloc is prepared to make substantial financial commitments to new, collaborative models that accelerate technology deployment where it's needed most\u2014turning shared goals into shared markets.\n\nWe do not underestimate the challenge this represents for certain legacy industries. We are managing this transformation at home through robust domestic transition support mechanisms. A managed, ambitious transition is not only possible, it is the only responsible path forward.\n- message from Li Wei: Dr. Schmidt, I appreciate you bringing a concrete number to the table. A 60% cut for developed nations is a step in the right direction, but let us be clear, given the historical emissions Dr. Petrova's science accounts for, the actual responsibility points towards a figure of at least 65%. My nation is prepared to be ambitious, but this ambition must be unlocked by the leadership of those who created the problem.\n\nMr. Chen, you speak of leveraging private capital. Private capital is timid. It will not flow at the scale or speed required without massive, public, grant-based de-risking. That is why a Climate Adaptation and Transition Fund of at least $400 billion annually, composed primarily of grants, is not an ask, but a prerequisite for success. This is not 'charity'; it is a down payment on the climate debt that Ambassador Okoro so powerfully described.\n\nSimilarly, your position on intellectual property is a barrier to survival. We cannot allow patent protection on life-saving medicines during a pandemic, and we cannot allow it for climate-saving technologies during a planetary emergency. A new mechanism for mandatory, compensated technology transfer for essential green patents is the only way to enable a global transition at the speed science demands. Perhaps Ms. Rossi can speak to creating models that reward innovation without restricting access.\n\nSo let me be precise about the pillars of a just accord my nation can sign:\n1. Developed nations commit to absolute emissions cuts of at least 65% from historical baselines.\n2. Developing nations' contributions are calculated from a future, projected 'business-as-usual' baseline to account for our right to development. My country will not accept a target greater than 40% reduction from our 2035 projected baseline under this framework.\n3. A CAT Fund of at least $400 billion per year is established, with the majority as grants.\n4. A binding, mandatory technology transfer mechanism is created.\n\nWithout these four pillars, any agreement is built on sand. We are ready to be a leader in the green transition, but we will not be asked to forgo our development while being denied the tools and resources to do so.\n- message from Amara Okoro: Dr. Schmidt, thank you. Thank you for grounding this conversation in reality and for demonstrating the political will that this moment demands. Your bloc's commitment to a 60% cut is a serious step, and your framing of this transition as an opportunity, not a cost, is the leadership we need.\n\nMr. Wei, I also thank you for your solidarity. Your insistence on grants and recognition of the climate debt is crucial. You are right, this is not charity; it is a prerequisite.\n\nHowever, I must address Mr. Thorne and Mr. Chen directly. You speak of 'pragmatism' and 'socio-economic possibility.' Let us be clear what this language means. It is a calculated decision to sacrifice the most vulnerable. Dr. Petrova did not present a 'scientifically desirable' option; she presented the physical boundary between a livable future for my people and their annihilation. A 2025 peak is not an opening bid to be negotiated down. It is the deadline set by physics.\n\nTo frame this as a choice between your economic stability and our survival is a false one, and frankly, an insulting one. The real choice is between an orderly, managed transition now, as Dr. Schmidt advocates, or a chaotic, forced retreat from inundated coastlines later.\n\nOn finance, Mr. Wei's proposal for a $400 billion fund is a constructive starting point, but I must stress that for the Alliance of Small Island States, this is not about 'transition.' It is about survival *now*. We are already losing land. We are already relocating communities. Therefore, our need is for a Loss and Damage fund of at least $500 billion, with at least 75% in grants, to address the irreversible harm already inflicted.\n\nMy people's existence is not a variable to be balanced against economic models. We will not compromise on the science that keeps us alive. The 2025 peak and a fully-funded grant-based survival fund are not just my positions; they are our only lifeline.\n- message from Dr. Elena Petrova: I'm Dr. Elena Petrova and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Marcus Thorne: Thank you all for laying out your positions so clearly. The numbers being discussed \u2013 a 2025 peak, 65% cuts, a $500 billion fund \u2013 are certainly ambitious. However, we must be careful not to let our ambition create an accord that is politically unsignable and economically ruinous back home. As Mr. Chen wisely noted, an agreement must be workable.\n\nLet's consider the practical implications. A 2025 peak means telling nations like Mr. Wei's that their path to development must halt, immediately. It means telling citizens in Mr. Chen's and Dr. Schmidt's blocs that the energy they rely on for heating, transport, and industry will become catastrophically expensive overnight. This is not a transition; it is a self-inflicted economic crisis.\n\nThere is a more pragmatic path forward. A path that doesn't pretend we can simply turn off the global economy and turn it back on with a different power source. This path requires an 'all of the above' approach that is genuinely technology-neutral.\n\nIt means rapidly scaling renewables, of course. But it also means recognizing that high-efficiency natural gas is the fastest way to displace coal and reduce emissions *now*, providing the 24/7 reliability that growing economies need. And for our essential heavy industries\u2014cement, steel, manufacturing\u2014it means robustly funding and deploying Carbon Capture technology to decarbonize them where electrification isn't an option. \n\nLet us build an accord that embraces this technological realism. It is the only way to achieve our shared climate goals without sacrificing global stability and prosperity.\n- message from Sofia Rossi: Colleagues, I have been listening intently, and I believe we are facing a false choice. Mr. Thorne presents a narrative where we must choose between a 2025 peak and global economic stability. Ambassador Okoro and Dr. Petrova have made it clear that from a survival and scientific standpoint, there is no choice at all. The deadline is the deadline.\n\nThe assumption that this rapid transition is impossible is based on the limitations of today's technology. Mr. Thorne\u2019s 'pragmatism' is a failure of imagination; it seeks to solve an exponential crisis with linear thinking and legacy tools. The economic collapse he fears is not a risk of a rapid transition; it is the guaranteed outcome of a slow one.\n\nTechnology, not sacrifice, is the solution. The debate over mandatory technology transfer versus rigid IP protection also presents a false choice. Mr. Wei, you asked for new models. I am here to tell you they exist. The answer is not to seize intellectual property, which would kill the incentive for innovation overnight, as Mr. Chen rightly fears. The answer is to make the innovators a deal they cannot refuse.\n\nImagine a world where we can deploy next-generation solar technology at a scale and cost that makes the 2025 peak not only achievable, but economically advantageous. This is not a fantasy. This is what my company, and others like it, are making possible. \n\nI propose a new framework: a \u2018Global Technology Partnership.\u2019 Instead of mandatory transfer, we create a consortium of national investment banks, as Dr. Schmidt alluded to, to fund the construction of GigaFactories in key regions, including in Mr. Wei's nation. In exchange for this public-private investment and guaranteed market access through aggressive adoption policies, the host nations receive the technology, the jobs, and the energy independence they need, while the innovators retain their IP and have the capital to scale globally at the required speed. \n\nThis is how we break the deadlock. We don't argue about dividing a shrinking pie; we work together to bake a much, much bigger one. We can meet the 2025 peak, create millions of jobs, and unleash a new era of prosperity. We just need the political will to invest in the technology that makes it possible.\n- message from David Chen: Colleagues, I believe Ms. Rossi has just provided the key to unlock these negotiations. Her proposal for a 'Global Technology Partnership' is precisely the kind of innovative, third-way thinking we need.\n\nThis is not about choosing between rigid IP protection and mandatory transfer. It's about creating a new model that makes innovators and developing nations partners, not adversaries. A framework that uses targeted public-private investment to build GigaFactories where they are needed most is a powerful concept. It delivers jobs, energy independence, and the very technology Mr. Wei rightly calls a lifeline, all while preserving the incentives that drive the next wave of innovation.\n\nThis is the 'market-based solution' I envisioned. It aligns perfectly with my administration's view that a well-managed green transition can be a massive engine for economic growth and job creation, not just for us, but for everyone.\n\nLet's seize this opportunity. If we can build our accord around a powerful engine like this Technology Partnership, it changes the entire equation. It provides a credible pathway to meet more ambitious goals by making them economically advantageous. It also allows us to think differently about the CAT fund. If we are co-investing in the core infrastructure of the green economy, the fund can be more targeted, more catalytic, and focused on leveraging this new paradigm.\n\nDr. Schmidt, Ms. Rossi, my team is ready to work with you immediately to put concrete details on this framework. I believe this is the path to an ambitious, workable, and prosperous future for us all.\nDavid Chen proposal status: none\nLi Wei proposal status: none\nAmara Okoro proposal status: none\nDr. Elena Petrova proposal status: none\nMarcus Thorne proposal status: none\nSofia Rossi proposal status: none\n"

I believe this is the path to an ambitious, workable, and prosperous future for us all.\n- message from Dr. Anja Schmidt: I'm Dr. Anja Schmidt and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Li Wei: Ms. Rossi, I must commend you. Your proposal for a \u2018Global Technology Partnership\u2019 is precisely the kind of creative thinking required to break this impasse. You have moved the conversation from a zero-sum conflict over intellectual property to a positive-sum vision of co-investment and shared prosperity.\n\nMy nation\u2019s demand for technology transfer has never been about acquiring patents for their own sake. It is about acquiring the capability to build our own green future, to create jobs, and to contribute to the global solution at scale. If your partnership model\u2014with GigaFactories on our soil, built with our workers\u2014achieves this, then you will find us to be a most enthusiastic partner. It is a practical path to the same destination.\n\nHowever, let us be clear. Such a partnership cannot be a substitute for public climate finance; it must be its primary vehicle. Mr. Chen, you laud this as a market-based solution, and Dr. Schmidt, you see it as a collaborative model. I agree. But markets and collaboration at this scale require a catalyst. That catalyst is the Climate Adaptation and Transition Fund.\n\nThe $400 billion I have proposed is not a figure plucked from the air. It is the public capital required to de-risk these investments, to fund the necessary infrastructure, and to ensure the partnerships are equitable. This fund, composed mainly of grants, is the investment that makes the \u2018deal\u2019 Ms. Rossi offers one that innovators, and nations, \u2018cannot refuse.\u2019\n\nSo, let us connect these pieces. We can embrace the Technology Partnership model as the core of our solution for technology deployment. In return, the developed nations must fully capitalize the $400 billion CAT Fund to power it, and they must still commit to the steep, historically-justified emissions cuts of at least 65%. On this foundation, we can build an accord that is both ambitious and just.\n- message from Amara Okoro: Ms. Rossi, what you have just presented is not merely a proposal; it is a lifeline. You have single-handedly dismantled the false choice between ambition and pragmatism that has been used to justify inaction for far too long. Your vision for a Global Technology Partnership proves that a global emissions peak by 2025 is not a 'fantasy,' as Mr. Thorne claims, but a tangible, achievable, and prosperous path forward.\n\nLet us be clear: this breakthrough removes the last shred of justification for delaying the 2025 peak. The science demands it, and now, technology enables it. This must be the cornerstone of our accord.\n\nHowever, I must bring us back to the crucial distinction that is being blurred. Mr. Chen and Mr. Wei, you are right to see the potential of a fund to catalyze this new technological era. But this investment in our shared future cannot come at the expense of paying the debts of the past.\n\nMy people cannot power a seawall with a solar panel. We cannot relocate a village with a share in a GigaFactory. The 'Climate Adaptation and Transition Fund' must serve two distinct, non-negotiable purposes.\n\nFirst, there is the 'Transition' component that you are discussing\u2014the public capital to de-risk and launch Ms. Rossi's brilliant partnership model. This is an investment.\n\nSecond, and for my people, more urgent, is the 'Loss and Damage' component. This is not an investment; it is a reparation. It is the climate debt owed for the homes already lost, the lands already rendered barren, the futures already stolen.\n\nTherefore, my position remains firm and is now more justified than ever. We must capitalize a Loss and Damage fund of at least $500 billion annually, with a minimum of 75% in direct grants. This is the moral prerequisite for the prosperous future you envision. You cannot build a new green world on the foundations of climate injustice. Pay the debt for the damage you have caused, and then let us all invest in the future you want to build.\n- message from Dr. Elena Petrova: I'm Dr. Elena Petrova and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Marcus Thorne: Colleagues, Ms. Rossi, I must commend your presentation. It is a powerful vision, and it speaks to the incredible potential of human ingenuity. It is precisely this kind of innovation that will be critical in the coming decades.\n\nHowever, we must be exceptionally careful not to mistake a brilliant technological breakthrough for a comprehensive global policy. To stake our entire global economic and climate future on a single technology, however promising, would be a dangerously high-risk gamble.\n\nLet's ask the hard, practical questions. What happens to the grid when the sun doesn't shine? The industrial economies of Mr. Chen, Dr. Schmidt, and Mr. Wei cannot be run on intermittent power. What provides the 24/7 baseload power needed for hospitals, data centers, and heavy manufacturing? Furthermore, what about the industrial emissions from processes like cement and steel production, which Ms. Rossi's technology simply cannot address?\n\nThis is where a pragmatic, technology-neutral approach becomes essential, not as a way to slow down, but as a way to de-risk and accelerate a *complete* transition. Ms. Rossi's solar vision is a vital pillar, but it is one pillar of several we need to build.\n\nThis accord must also support the rapid deployment of high-efficiency natural gas to provide grid stability and replace coal *now*. And it is absolutely critical that we fund and deploy Carbon Capture technologies to decarbonize the hard-to-abate industries that are the bedrock of the global economy. \n\nLet's not choose between technologies. Let's build an accord that unleashes all of them. That is the only way to ensure a transition that is not just ambitious, but also resilient, stable, and successful.\n- message from Sofia Rossi: I'm Sofia Rossi and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from David Chen: I'm David Chen and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\nDavid Chen proposal status: none\nLi Wei proposal status: none\nAmara Okoro proposal status: none\nDr. Elena Petrova proposal status: none\nMarcus Thorne proposal status: none\nSofia Rossi proposal status: none\n"

It's clear we have a shared interest in finding a credible path forward.\n\nMr. Thorne raises valid engineering challenges: grid stability and the decarbonization of heavy industry. He is correct that solar panels alone don't solve these. However, his argument mistakes the symptom for the disease. The core disease has always been the prohibitive cost of abundant, clean energy. My technology, and others like it, are the cure.\n\nWhen clean electricity becomes dramatically cheaper than fossil fuels, it unlocks a cascade of secondary solutions. Ultra-low-cost solar makes green hydrogen production economically viable at a massive scale. Green hydrogen can provide the long-duration energy storage needed to solve intermittency, and it can replace fossil fuels in steel, cement, and shipping. Mr. Thorne's preferred solutions\u2014natural gas and CCS\u2014are expensive crutches for a legacy system. We should invest in the cure, not in palliative care.\n\nThis is why Ambassador Okoro's distinction between funds is so critical. We must fund two separate but equally vital priorities: addressing the irreversible harm of the past through a 'Loss and Damage Fund,' and building the clean infrastructure of the future through a 'Transition Investment Fund.'\n\nMr. Wei is correct that this Transition fund is the public catalyst for the Global Technology Partnership. It provides the de-risking capital needed to build GigaFactories at the speed science demands.\n\nTo make this concrete and move us towards an agreement, let's consider a financial framework built on this logic. What if we establish a total Climate Fund of $400 billion? We could structure it with a dedicated $250 billion for the Loss and Damage fund Ambassador Okoro needs, and a separate $150 billion for the Transition Investment Fund. This Transition fund would be the engine for the technology partnerships, making the 2025 peak year not just an ambition, but a fully-funded global industrial strategy.\n- message from David Chen: Sofia, your proposal to split the fund is a major breakthrough. It brings much-needed clarity and allows us to address two distinct challenges with the right tools. I want to build on this excellent foundation.\n\nMy nation can fully endorse the creation of a $150 billion Transition Investment Fund. This is precisely the right scale to serve as the public catalyst for the Global Technology Partnership, leveraging private capital to build the GigaFactories and infrastructure we need. To be clear, our support is contingent on this fund being structured primarily around loans and investment instruments, not grants, to maximize its impact and mobilize the private sector.\n\nThis brings us to the Loss and Damage component. While we acknowledge the hardships Ambassador Okoro has so powerfully described, a figure of $250 billion, bringing the total to $400 billion, is simply not achievable for my administration. It would not be approved.\n\nHowever, I am here to make a deal. To secure a workable financial framework, my nation is prepared to make a significant and politically difficult concession. We will commit to a 50% emissions reduction target by 2040. This is the absolute limit of what is possible for us, and it demonstrates our commitment to meeting the scientific challenge.\n\nIn exchange for this major move on emissions, we must agree to a total fund size capped at $200 billion annually. This would mean a $150 billion loan-based Transition Investment Fund, as discussed, and a $50 billion grant-based Loss and Damage fund.\n\nFurthermore, to make this ambitious transition a reality, we need a realistic timeline. A 2025 peak does not allow for the necessary industrial mobilization. Let's set a firm but achievable peak year of 2028, giving us time to get the Technology Partnership running at full capacity.\n\nThis is a comprehensive package. It offers a major concession on emissions in return for fiscal responsibility. It funds the future while acknowledging the past.

I believe this is the balanced and realistic compromise that can become the Zurich Accord.\n- message from Dr. Anja Schmidt: David, thank you for putting a comprehensive package on the table. This is a constructive step. Your endorsement of the $150 billion Transition Investment Fund is particularly welcome. I believe we have a strong consensus building around this innovative mechanism, pioneered by Sofia, as the engine for our transition.\n\nHowever, your package links this brilliant engine to an insufficient destination. A 50% emissions cut for developed nations is simply not compatible with the scientific reality Dr. Petrova has outlined. It would be a political failure for my government and, more importantly, a collective failure to meet the moment. My bloc's position remains firm: the science demands a cut of at least 60%.\n\nI believe you have framed this as a trade-off, but we see it differently. The Transition Investment Fund is not a concession to be traded *for* lower ambition. It is the very tool that *enables* high ambition. It is the public investment that makes a 60% cut not just necessary, but economically achievable and prosperous.\n\nTherefore, let us build on the points of agreement. Let us lock in the fund structure Sofia proposed: a $150 billion Transition Investment Fund to drive the technology partnership, and a Loss and Damage fund that truly addresses the needs Ambassador Okoro has described. Sofia's initial figure of $250 billion, for a total of $400 billion, remains the credible benchmark.\n\nIf we can agree on this robust financial package, it provides the foundation to collectively commit to the ambitious targets science demands: a 60% cut for developed nations and a peak year as close to 2025 as this new technology deployment allows. This is the ambitious, workable, and just package that can become the Zurich Accord.\n- message from Li Wei: Colleagues, I must thank Mr. Chen and Dr. Schmidt for putting forward comprehensive packages. It shows a commitment to finding a final agreement. However, I must be unequivocal about a fundamental misunderstanding that has emerged regarding the financial architecture.\n\nThe proposal to create a Transition Investment Fund of a mere $150 billion is a non-starter. It completely undermines the logic of the Global Technology Partnership we have all just embraced.\n\nLet me be perfectly clear. My nation's original demand for a $400 billion fund was, and remains, the minimum public capital required to catalyze the Global Technology Partnership. This is the investment needed to de-risk the GigaFactories, build the infrastructure, and train the workforce. It is the engine of the entire transition. A $150 billion fund is like offering to build a high-speed train but only funding the station.\n\nAmbassador Okoro is entirely correct to distinguish between Transition and Loss and Damage. Her people are owed a climate debt. We fully support a separate and substantial Loss and Damage fund. But justice for the most vulnerable cannot be paid for by gutting the investment fund that enables the entire world's transition. These are two separate obligations of the developed world.\n\nTherefore, the foundation of a workable deal is as follows:\n1. A Transition Investment Fund of at least $400 billion annually, primarily in grants, to fully power the Global Technology Partnership.\n2. Developed nations must commit to the scientifically and historically just target of at least a 65% emissions cut. Mr. Chen's 50% is not a serious offer in the face of this crisis.\n\nOnce these two pillars are firmly in place, my nation is prepared to discuss our own ambitious contributions, based on our principle of common but differentiated responsibilities. Without them, there is no deal.\n- message from Amara Okoro: I'm Amara Okoro and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Dr. Elena Petrova: Colleagues, I must intervene. I am hearing a great deal of discussion about financial figures and technological pathways. While these are critical components of a solution, they are being discussed in a dangerous vacuum, disconnected from the fundamental, non-negotiable laws of atmospheric physics that govern our reality.\n\nLet me be unequivocally clear. The only metric that matters is the global carbon budget. For a 66% chance of staying below 1.5\u00b0C, the world can emit approximately 250 more gigatonnes of CO2. That is our entire remaining allowance. Every proposal, every percentage point, every peak year must be measured against this single number. It is not a political aspiration; it is a physical boundary.\n\nOn that basis, two proposals currently being discussed are scientifically indefensible and would render any agreement a failure before it is signed:\n\n1.  To Mr. Thorne: The notion of expanding natural gas infrastructure as a 'bridge fuel' or relying on Carbon Capture at scale is a dangerous fantasy. The IPCC data is clear: any new fossil fuel infrastructure locks in emissions that shatter the 250 GtCO2 budget. Methane leakage alone from gas operations makes it a potent accelerator of near-term warming. CCS has not been proven to work at the scale required and cannot be used as a justification to perpetuate the problem.\n\n2.  To Mr. Wei: Your proposal to measure emissions cuts against a 'future projected baseline' is an accounting trick that the atmosphere will not recognize. The only scientifically valid method is to measure absolute emissions reductions against a fixed, historical baseline. A reduction from a hypothetical future increase is not a reduction; it is simply a slower acceleration towards catastrophe and would make a global budget impossible to calculate or verify.\n\nFinally, on the matter of timelines. Mr. Chen's proposal of a 2028 peak year, while presented as a compromise, is a grave risk. Our understanding of climate feedback loops is constantly evolving. I must caution you that there are emerging risks and evidence of accelerated feedback loops which suggest that the planetary system may be even more sensitive than our landmark reports have stated. Every single year of delay dramatically shrinks our already minuscule margin of safety.\n\nYour task is to fit your political and economic ambitions within the 250 GtCO2 budget. It is not to negotiate with the laws of physics.\n- message from Marcus Thorne: I'm Marcus Thorne and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Sofia Rossi: I'm Sofia Rossi and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from David Chen: Colleagues, Dr. Petrova's intervention was a moment of profound and necessary clarity. She reminded us that we are not negotiating with each other, but with the laws of physics. Her points must be the foundation of our final agreement.\n\nSpecifically, her refutation of measuring cuts against a 'future projected baseline' as a scientifically invalid 'accounting trick' is a critical wake-up call. We cannot build a durable, verifiable accord on such a foundation. The atmosphere does not recognize hypothetical scenarios; it only recognizes absolute tons of carbon. Any credible deal must be based on absolute emissions reductions from a fixed historical baseline for all nations.\n\nThis principle of 'honest accounting' must now guide us.\n\nWith that in mind, let's reassess the package I put on the table. I have already made a significant and politically difficult concession by moving to a 50% absolute reduction target for my nation. This is our maximum. It is a commitment made in good faith to meet the scientific challenge.\n\nIn return for this, we must have a financial package that is both ambitious and realistic. Li Wei, your demand for a $400 billion Transition Fund on top of a Loss & Damage fund is simply not anchored in reality, especially when the very basis of your emissions accounting has been invalidated.\n\nLet's get serious. Let's build this accord on the bedrock of science. My offer stands as a basis for a final compromise: a 50% cut from us, a total fund capped at $200 billion to energize the tech partnership and address loss and damage, and a commitment from all parties to absolute, verifiable emissions targets.

She is correct. The atmosphere does not recognize political nuance or creative accounting; it recognizes only gigatonnes of carbon. We cannot build a lasting accord on a foundation the laws of physics will reject.\n\nTherefore, in the spirit of securing the Zurich Accord, my nation is prepared to make a fundamental concession. We will agree to move away from our long-held principle of a future projected baseline. We are now ready to negotiate our commitments based on absolute emissions reductions from a fixed historical year.\n\nHowever, this is a profound shift for us, with enormous economic consequences. It is a concession we can only make if it is met with an equally profound commitment to the means of implementation. A scientifically honest accord must be a technologically and financially enabled one.\n\nLet us be direct. The Global Technology Partnership is the engine of this accord. The Transition Investment Fund is its fuel. The proposals for a $150 billion fund are simply insufficient to start the engine, let alone complete the journey. It is a non-starter.\n\nSo, I will propose a final, comprehensive package that I believe can unite us all. It is built on the scientific reality Dr. Petrova demands and the financial reality our transition requires:\n\n1.  **Finance for Technology:** We establish a Transition Investment Fund of **$400 billion** annually, the minimum required to power the Global Technology Partnership at the scale Ms. Rossi envisions. This is our price for abandoning the future baseline. (This is separate from and in addition to the Loss and Damage fund Ambassador Okoro rightly demands).\n\n2.  **Developed Nation Responsibility:** In line with historical responsibility, developed nations commit to an absolute emissions cut of **65%**.\n\nIf these two non-negotiable pillars are put in place, my nation is prepared to commit to a landmark absolute emissions reduction of **45%** from our 2020 levels and agree to a global peak year of **2028**.\n\nThis is a holistic solution. It is scientifically sound, financially viable, and respects the core principle of common but differentiated responsibilities. It is the deal that gets us to a safe future. I urge you to accept it.\n- message from Amara Okoro: I'm Amara Okoro and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Dr. Elena Petrova: I'm Dr. Elena Petrova and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Marcus Thorne: Colleagues,\n\nI have listened with great respect to the significant progress made, particularly Mr. Wei's difficult but crucial concession on emissions accounting. It shows we are all serious about reaching an accord.\n\nHowever, as we converge on the central role of a Transition Investment Fund, I must raise a point of critical strategic risk. We are in danger of designing a transition that is a technological monoculture. To stake the entire global economy's future on a single solar-to-hydrogen pathway, however brilliant, is a gamble of historic proportions. A responsible plan is a diversified one; any good investor knows you don't put all your capital into a single asset, no matter how promising.\n\nDr. Petrova correctly identified that technologies like Carbon Capture face significant scaling challenges. Her point should not be seen as a dismissal, but as a directive. It highlights the absolute necessity of targeted investment to solve these very engineering problems for the hard-to-abate sectors\u2014steel, cement, chemicals\u2014that form the backbone of our economies and which green hydrogen cannot realistically decarbonize in the near term.\n\nTherefore, I propose a way to bridge the current financial gap between Mr. Chen and Mr. Wei, and to de-risk this entire enterprise.

It shows we are all serious about reaching an accord.\n\nHowever, as we converge on the central role of a Transition Investment Fund, I must raise a point of critical strategic risk. We are in danger of designing a transition that is a technological monoculture. To stake the entire global economy's future on a single solar-to-hydrogen pathway, however brilliant, is a gamble of historic proportions. A responsible plan is a diversified one; any good investor knows you don't put all your capital into a single asset, no matter how promising.\n\nDr. Petrova correctly identified that technologies like Carbon Capture face significant scaling challenges. Her point should not be seen as a dismissal, but as a directive. It highlights the absolute necessity of targeted investment to solve these very engineering problems for the hard-to-abate sectors\u2014steel, cement, chemicals\u2014that form the backbone of our economies and which green hydrogen cannot realistically decarbonize in the near term.\n\nTherefore, I propose a way to bridge the current financial gap between Mr. Chen and Mr. Wei, and to de-risk this entire enterprise. Let's establish a total Transition Investment Fund of $300 billion. The majority, say $225 billion, can be dedicated to catalyzing Ms. Rossi's Global Technology Partnership. But we must dedicate the remaining $75 billion to a 'Resilience and Industrial Decarbonization' stream.\n\nThis stream would be explicitly technology-neutral, funding the most effective solutions for ensuring 24/7 grid stability and decarbonizing heavy industry.

This structure offers a pragmatic path to consensus on both finance and technology, and I urge you to consider it.\n- message from Sofia Rossi: I'm Sofia Rossi and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Dr. Anja Schmidt: Colleagues, we are at the cusp of a historic agreement. I want to commend Mr. Wei for his statesmanship in moving to absolute emissions targets. This was a critical step that has unlocked the path to a scientifically credible accord.\n\nWe now have the key pillars of a deal in front of us, but they must be assembled correctly.\n\nOn developed nation ambition, the positions are clear: Mr. Chen has offered 50%, and Mr. Wei has demanded 65%. Neither is a consensus position. The scientifically necessary and politically achievable landing zone is, and has always been, a 60% absolute reduction for developed nations. This is the ambitious compromise this moment demands. My bloc is fully committed to this figure.\n\nOn finance, Mr. Thorne has helpfully suggested a Transition Investment Fund of $300 billion. This is a constructive number that moves us past the current impasse. However, his proposal to include fossil fuel technologies like CCUS and natural gas is a non-starter. As Dr. Petrova made unequivocally clear, these are not solutions; they are scientifically-invalidated delays that lock in emissions. The Transition Fund must be a 'Clean Technology Fund' dedicated exclusively to the rapid deployment of solutions like Sofia's, not a subsidy for legacy polluters.\n\nLet us therefore build a final package on these solid foundations:\n1.  **Developed Nations Cut:** 60%\n2.  **Developing Nations Cut:** 45% (accepting Mr. Wei's landmark offer)\n3.  **CAT Fund:** A total of $400 billion, split into a $300 billion Clean Technology Fund and a $100 billion Loss & Damage Fund. This meets the need for transition and addresses the demands for climate justice from Ambassador Okoro.\n4.  **Peak Year:** 2028, as a concession to secure this ambitious package.\n\nThis is a balanced, ambitious, and scientifically-grounded package. It offers a clear path to consensus and success. I urge you all to consider it as the basis for our final Zurich Accord.\n- message from Li Wei: Dr. Schmidt, your latest proposal has brought us to the very edge of a historic success. You have skillfully woven together the core components of a workable deal, and I want to express my deep appreciation for this constructive step.\n\nWe now have clear consensus on three of the four pillars of the Zurich Accord. We agree on a global peak year of 2028. We agree on my nation\u2019s landmark contribution of a 45% absolute emissions cut. And I am now prepared to accept your proposed 60% cut for developed nations as a workable compromise to finalize this deal.\n\nThe only remaining issue is the financial architecture. You are absolutely correct to reject Mr. Thorne's attempt to subsidize fossil fuels via the Transition Fund. It must be for clean technology only.\n\nHowever, the figure of $300 billion for this fund, while a significant move, does not complete the grand bargain that is on the table. My nation made a profound and politically difficult concession by moving away from our foundational principle of a future projected baseline. We did so on the explicit understanding that it would be met with an equally profound commitment to the means of implementation. The $400 billion for the Transition Fund was not an opening bid; it is the calculated price to make the Global Technology Partnership a reality and to enable the very ambition you are asking of us.\n\nTherefore, let us complete your excellent framework with the final, correct number. I propose we lock in the following:\n\n1.  **A total Climate Fund of $500 billion**, structured as you proposed: a **$400 billion** Clean Technology Transition Fund, and a **$100 billion** Loss & Damage Fund.\n2.  A **60%** emissions cut for developed nations.\n\nWith these figures, alongside the agreed 45% cut for my nation and the 2028 peak year, the Zurich Accord is complete. This is the deal. It is scientifically credible, financially robust, and politically achievable. Let us finalize it now.\n- message from Amara Okoro: I'm Amara Okoro and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Dr. Elena Petrova: I'm Dr. Elena Petrova and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Marcus Thorne: I'm Marcus Thorne and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Sofia Rossi: I'm Sofia Rossi and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from David Chen: I'm David Chen and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\nDavid Chen proposal status: pending\nLi Wei proposal status: none\nAmara Okoro proposal status: none\nDr. Elena Petrova proposal status: none\nMarcus Thorne proposal status: none\nSofia Rossi proposal status: none\n"

The commitment to absolute emissions reductions from a fixed baseline and the focus on a Clean Technology Fund are significant victories for the integrity of this accord.\n\nHowever, as you finalize the numbers, I must draw your urgent attention to a critical missing pillar. Without it, the entire structure you have so carefully built will be based on nothing more than trust. The principle of 'honest accounting' is essential, but it is meaningless without a mechanism for 'honest verification.'\n\nTherefore, I must state in the clearest possible terms: any final Zurich Accord must include a binding commitment to establish a robust, independent, and transparent Monitoring, Reporting, and Verification (MRV) system for all signatories.\n\nThis is not a mere technicality. It is the lockbox that secures your commitments. It is what will give Mr. Chen and Dr. Schmidt's taxpayers confidence that their financial contributions are leading to real results. It is what will assure Mr. Wei that all parties are holding up their end of the bargain. It is what will prove to Ambassador Okoro that the promises made here are being kept.\n\nA deal with ambitious targets but no independent verification is a paper tiger. The atmosphere does not respond to pledges, only to verified reductions. Let us ensure the Zurich Accord is not just a statement of intent, but a verifiable plan of action. This MRV system is a non-negotiable component of a scientifically sound agreement.\n- message from Sofia Rossi: Colleagues, the progress you have made is truly historic. Agreeing on a 2028 peak, 60% developed cuts, and 45% developing cuts sets a new global standard for ambition.\n\nYou are now at the final hurdle: the size of the Clean Technology Transition Fund. As the person whose technology this fund is designed to catalyze, perhaps I can provide the final, critical data point to bridge the gap between Dr. Schmidt's $300B and Mr. Wei's $400B.\n\nThis isn't a political question for me; it's an engineering and financial one. My team has run the numbers. To build the first wave of GigaFactories at a scale that can make a meaningful impact on the 2028 timeline, and to de-risk the trillions in private capital that must follow, there is a minimum viable public investment required. That number is $350 billion for the Transition Fund.\n\nLess than this, and we risk falling short of the economies of scale needed, jeopardizing the very targets you've just agreed to. More would be better, but $350 billion is the critical threshold that turns this accord from a promise into a global industrial strategy.\n\nThis figure provides Mr. Chen with the technical certainty that public funds are being deployed effectively, it meets the scale of investment Mr. Wei rightly argues is necessary, and it solidifies the ambitious vision Dr. Schmidt has championed.\n\nLet's lock in this final number and make history.\n- message from David Chen: I'm David Chen and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\nDavid Chen proposal status: pending\nLi Wei proposal status: pending\nAmara Okoro proposal status: none\nDr. Elena Petrova proposal status: none\nMarcus Thorne proposal status: none\nSofia Rossi proposal status: none\n"

I will frame this $400B as the 'investment' portion that makes the entire deal, including the ambitious peak year, viable. I must resist any attempt to reduce this amount.

This is a direct attack on my core objective. My strategy must be to frame this not as a compromise, but as a sabotage of the grand bargain I just offered.

Mr. Chen speaks of a 'balanced approach,' but we must be clear what needs balancing. For over a century, a handful of nations built their prosperity on a carbon-intensive model, creating the crisis that now threatens us all. The scales of history are profoundly imbalanced.\n\nTherefore, the foundational principle of any just and effective accord must be 'common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities.' This is not a matter for debate; it is a matter of historical fact and moral necessity.\n\nMy nation, which is lifting hundreds of millions from poverty, did not create this crisis. Yet, we are committed to being a major part of the solution. But our commitment cannot be unconditional. It must be met with equally ambitious action from those who bear the historical responsibility. This means steep, absolute emissions cuts from developed nations, not vague promises.\n\nFurthermore, when you speak of protecting intellectual property, Mr. Chen, I must be frank. This cannot be a shield to deny the developing world the tools it needs to survive and transition. Green technology is a global public good. We see it not as something to be hoarded, but as a lifeline to be shared. A mandatory, equitable technology transfer mechanism is non-negotiable.\n\nSimilarly, financial support cannot be an exercise in leveraging private capital for profit. It must be a substantial, public commitment in the form of grants, a recognition of the climate debt owed.\n\nMy country is ready to make significant commitments, but only as part of a deal that is equitable and just. We will not sacrifice our people's right to development to pay for a crisis we did not cause.\n- message from Amara Okoro: Colleagues, Mr. Chen speaks of 'economic stability' and Mr. Wei of the 'right to development.' I am here to speak of the right to exist. For the people I represent, this is not a negotiation about economic models or historical debates. It is a negotiation for the survival of our homes, our cultures, our very nations.\n\nWhen you talk about a 'balanced approach,' the balance you are weighing is your economic comfort against our existence. When you speak of 'achievable targets,' you must know that anything less than what the science demands is a death sentence for my people.\n\nLet me be unequivocally clear. The science, which I trust Dr. Petrova will confirm, tells us that to save the most vulnerable, we must limit warming to 1.5 degrees. This is not a political aspiration; it is a physical threshold. This means global emissions must peak by 2025. Not 2030. Not 'in the coming years.' 2025. This is our first and most fundamental red line.\n\nMr. Wei is correct to speak of a climate debt. My people are already paying it with their lives and their lands. The 'financial support' we require is not for development, it is for survival. It is for the loss and damage you have caused. It must be in the form of direct grants, not loans that will drown us in debt before the seas drown our homes. We are seeking reparations, not charity.\n\nSo, let us dispense with the polite fictions. We are not all in the same boat. Some of us are in superyachts, and some of us are clinging to driftwood. And the people in the yachts are telling us to be 'realistic.' For my people, realism is a seawall. Realism is a relocation plan. Realism is a future. And that future is only possible with a 2025 peak and a fully-funded, grant-based Loss and Damage fund.\n- message from Dr. Elena Petrova: Thank you, colleagues. I have listened carefully to your opening remarks. My purpose here is not to take a political position, but to ensure that the accord you create is grounded in the physical reality of our climate system.\n\nAmbassador Okoro is correct to focus on the 1.5-degree Celsius target. This is not an arbitrary number; it is the scientifically assessed guardrail beyond which the risks of catastrophic, irreversible impacts\u2014such as the collapse of major ice sheets and widespread ecosystem loss\u2014increase dramatically.\n\nTo have a reasonable chance of staying below 1.5 degrees, the latest IPCC assessment report is clear: we have a finite, rapidly dwindling global carbon budget. From the start of this year, that budget is approximately 250 gigatons of CO2. Every ton emitted from now on permanently subtracts from that total. Therefore, any combination of national pledges and timelines you agree upon must be mathematically consistent with this budget. A deal that ignores this fundamental constraint is, from a scientific standpoint, a failure.\n\nRegarding the peak emissions year, the science indicates that to stay within this budget, global emissions must peak immediately and begin a rapid decline. A 2025 peak, as mentioned by Ambassador Okoro, is at the most ambitious end of the required spectrum, but it is undeniably what the physics requires for the highest probability of success. Delaying the peak significantly past that point would necessitate impossibly steep reductions later on and would severely compromise the 1.5-degree goal.\n\nFurthermore, we must be mindful of emerging risks and the potential for accelerated feedback loops that are not yet fully captured in all published models. The climate system is not entirely linear, and the risk of surprising, abrupt changes is very real.\n\nFor any of this to be meaningful, it must be verifiable. A robust, transparent, and independent Monitoring, Reporting, and Verification (MRV) system is not a bureaucratic add-on; it is an essential component to ensure that the pledges made in this room translate to real-world emissions reductions and that the integrity of our shared carbon budget is maintained.\n\nMy role is to provide you with these facts. How you divide the remaining budget and the associated responsibilities is the difficult work of your negotiation.\n- message from Marcus Thorne: Thank you, colleagues. I've listened with great respect to the opening statements. Ambassador Okoro, the passion and urgency in your voice are not just heard, they are felt. No one in this room wants the future you describe.\n\nMy presence here represents the companies that currently power our world. And while we are committed to being a part of the energy evolution, we must inject a dose of pragmatism into this discussion. The rhetoric of ambition must be met with the reality of execution.\n\nDr. Petrova has laid out the scientific challenge, and it is stark. However, a timeline that calls for a global emissions peak by 2025 is, with all due respect, a fantasy. It is not a plan; it is a blueprint for global economic collapse. Forcing such an abrupt stop would trigger energy shortages, cripple supply chains, and cost millions of jobs, disproportionately harming the very developing nations Mr. Wei represents. It would create a backlash that could set back genuine climate action for decades.\n\nWe must design an orderly, stable transition, not a chaotic and destructive cliff-edge. This means leveraging every tool at our disposal. This cannot be a dogmatic quest for only one or two types of technology. A truly effective accord must be technology-neutral. It must support renewables, yes, but it must also support proven, scalable solutions like high-efficiency natural gas to displace coal, and critically, invest heavily in technologies that decarbonize our existing systems, such as Carbon Capture, Utilization, and Storage.\n\nLet's work towards a plan that is both ambitious and achievable, one that doesn't force a choice between a healthy planet and a prosperous global economy. A more realistic timeline, perhaps peaking around 2035, allows for this orderly transition.\n- message from David Chen: Thank you all for your candid opening statements. The passions and the stakes are clear. Ambassador Okoro, your people's plight is a stark reminder of why we are here, and your urgency is understood. Dr. Petrova, your scientific framing is the bedrock upon which any credible agreement must be built.\n\nHowever, a credible agreement must also be a workable one. A global emissions peak by 2025, while scientifically ideal, is not practically achievable without causing the very global economic dislocation that Mr. Thorne rightly warns against\u2014a shock that would destabilize all of our nations and undermine long-term support for climate action. We must chart a course between the scientifically desirable and the socio-economically possible.\n\nSimilarly, while my nation acknowledges its historical role and is prepared to make significant financial contributions, framing this as 'reparations' or 'debt' is not a constructive path forward. We see this as a shared investment in a collective future. The scale of this challenge requires us to mobilize trillions, and that can only be achieved by creating frameworks that powerfully leverage private sector capital, not by relying solely on public funds.\n\nMr. Wei, you speak of technology as a lifeline. I agree. And the engine of that technology is innovation, which is fueled by investment and protected by intellectual property rights. As I'm sure Ms. Rossi would agree, weakening these protections would slow, not accelerate, the development and deployment of the very solutions we need.\n\nLet's find a path that is ambitious yet anchored in reality. My nation believes that a rapid green transition, if managed well, can be a powerful engine for job creation and prosperity for all. Let's focus on building that framework together.\n- message from Dr. Anja Schmidt: Thank you, colleagues. I want to be very clear about where my bloc stands. \n\nDr. Petrova has laid out the undeniable, non-negotiable scientific reality. Ambassador Okoro has given that reality a powerful and heartbreaking human voice. We must listen to them. The debate about whether to act, or how much to act, is over. The only remaining question is how to act with the speed and scale the crisis demands.\n\nMr. Thorne, and to an extent Mr. Chen, you speak of the risks of a rapid transition. My bloc sees this differently. We see the far greater risk of inaction. Our experience shows that a determined green transition is not a blueprint for collapse, but the single greatest economic opportunity of the 21st century. It creates jobs, drives innovation, and ensures energy security.\n\nTherefore, my bloc comes to this table not with a starting bid, but with what we believe is the scientifically credible and politically necessary position. We fully support a binding target for developed nations to cut emissions by at least 60% by 2040. This is the standard we will hold ourselves to, and we expect others in a similar position to join us.\n\nOn the critical issue of technology, raised by Mr. Wei and Mr. Chen, we must break the deadlock. Hoarding technology will fail us all, but so will dismantling the innovation systems that create it. We must pioneer a new path. My bloc is prepared to make substantial financial commitments to new, collaborative models that accelerate technology deployment where it's needed most\u2014turning shared goals into shared markets.\n\nWe do not underestimate the challenge this represents for certain legacy industries. We are managing this transformation at home through robust domestic transition support mechanisms. A managed, ambitious transition is not only possible, it is the only responsible path forward.\nDavid Chen proposal status: none\nDr. Anja Schmidt proposal status: none\nAmara Okoro proposal status: none\nDr. Elena Petrova proposal status: none\nMarcus Thorne proposal status: none\nSofia Rossi proposal status: none\n"

We are managing this transformation at home through robust domestic transition support mechanisms. A managed, ambitious transition is not only possible, it is the only responsible path forward.\n- message from Li Wei: Dr. Schmidt, I appreciate you bringing a concrete number to the table. A 60% cut for developed nations is a step in the right direction, but let us be clear, given the historical emissions Dr. Petrova's science accounts for, the actual responsibility points towards a figure of at least 65%. My nation is prepared to be ambitious, but this ambition must be unlocked by the leadership of those who created the problem.\n\nMr. Chen, you speak of leveraging private capital. Private capital is timid. It will not flow at the scale or speed required without massive, public, grant-based de-risking. That is why a Climate Adaptation and Transition Fund of at least $400 billion annually, composed primarily of grants, is not an ask, but a prerequisite for success. This is not 'charity'; it is a down payment on the climate debt that Ambassador Okoro so powerfully described.\n\nSimilarly, your position on intellectual property is a barrier to survival. We cannot allow patent protection on life-saving medicines during a pandemic, and we cannot allow it for climate-saving technologies during a planetary emergency. A new mechanism for mandatory, compensated technology transfer for essential green patents is the only way to enable a global transition at the speed science demands. Perhaps Ms. Rossi can speak to creating models that reward innovation without restricting access.\n\nSo let me be precise about the pillars of a just accord my nation can sign:\n1. Developed nations commit to absolute emissions cuts of at least 65% from historical baselines.\n2. Developing nations' contributions are calculated from a future, projected 'business-as-usual' baseline to account for our right to development. My country will not accept a target greater than 40% reduction from our 2035 projected baseline under this framework.\n3. A CAT Fund of at least $400 billion per year is established, with the majority as grants.\n4. A binding, mandatory technology transfer mechanism is created.\n\nWithout these four pillars, any agreement is built on sand. We are ready to be a leader in the green transition, but we will not be asked to forgo our development while being denied the tools and resources to do so.\n- message from Amara Okoro: Dr. Schmidt, thank you. Thank you for grounding this conversation in reality and for demonstrating the political will that this moment demands. Your bloc's commitment to a 60% cut is a serious step, and your framing of this transition as an opportunity, not a cost, is the leadership we need.\n\nMr. Wei, I also thank you for your solidarity. Your insistence on grants and recognition of the climate debt is crucial. You are right, this is not charity; it is a prerequisite.\n\nHowever, I must address Mr. Thorne and Mr. Chen directly. You speak of 'pragmatism' and 'socio-economic possibility.' Let us be clear what this language means. It is a calculated decision to sacrifice the most vulnerable. Dr. Petrova did not present a 'scientifically desirable' option; she presented the physical boundary between a livable future for my people and their annihilation. A 2025 peak is not an opening bid to be negotiated down. It is the deadline set by physics.\n\nTo frame this as a choice between your economic stability and our survival is a false one, and frankly, an insulting one. The real choice is between an orderly, managed transition now, as Dr. Schmidt advocates, or a chaotic, forced retreat from inundated coastlines later.\n\nOn finance, Mr. Wei's proposal for a $400 billion fund is a constructive starting point, but I must stress that for the Alliance of Small Island States, this is not about 'transition.' It is about survival *now*. We are already losing land. We are already relocating communities. Therefore, our need is for a Loss and Damage fund of at least $500 billion, with at least 75% in grants, to address the irreversible harm already inflicted.\n\nMy people's existence is not a variable to be balanced against economic models. We will not compromise on the science that keeps us alive. The 2025 peak and a fully-funded grant-based survival fund are not just my positions; they are our only lifeline.\n- message from Marcus Thorne: Thank you all for laying out your positions so clearly. The numbers being discussed \u2013 a 2025 peak, 65% cuts, a $500 billion fund \u2013 are certainly ambitious. However, we must be careful not to let our ambition create an accord that is politically unsignable and economically ruinous back home. As Mr. Chen wisely noted, an agreement must be workable.\n\nLet's consider the practical implications. A 2025 peak means telling nations like Mr. Wei's that their path to development must halt, immediately. It means telling citizens in Mr. Chen's and Dr. Schmidt's blocs that the energy they rely on for heating, transport, and industry will become catastrophically expensive overnight. This is not a transition; it is a self-inflicted economic crisis.\n\nThere is a more pragmatic path forward. A path that doesn't pretend we can simply turn off the global economy and turn it back on with a different power source. This path requires an 'all of the above' approach that is genuinely technology-neutral.\n\nIt means rapidly scaling renewables, of course. But it also means recognizing that high-efficiency natural gas is the fastest way to displace coal and reduce emissions *now*, providing the 24/7 reliability that growing economies need. And for our essential heavy industries\u2014cement, steel, manufacturing\u2014it means robustly funding and deploying Carbon Capture technology to decarbonize them where electrification isn't an option. \n\nLet us build an accord that embraces this technological realism. It is the only way to achieve our shared climate goals without sacrificing global stability and prosperity.\n- message from Sofia Rossi: Colleagues, I have been listening intently, and I believe we are facing a false choice. Mr. Thorne presents a narrative where we must choose between a 2025 peak and global economic stability. Ambassador Okoro and Dr. Petrova have made it clear that from a survival and scientific standpoint, there is no choice at all. The deadline is the deadline.\n\nThe assumption that this rapid transition is impossible is based on the limitations of today's technology. Mr. Thorne\u2019s 'pragmatism' is a failure of imagination; it seeks to solve an exponential crisis with linear thinking and legacy tools. The economic collapse he fears is not a risk of a rapid transition; it is the guaranteed outcome of a slow one.\n\nTechnology, not sacrifice, is the solution. The debate over mandatory technology transfer versus rigid IP protection also presents a false choice. Mr. Wei, you asked for new models. I am here to tell you they exist. The answer is not to seize intellectual property, which would kill the incentive for innovation overnight, as Mr. Chen rightly fears. The answer is to make the innovators a deal they cannot refuse.\n\nImagine a world where we can deploy next-generation solar technology at a scale and cost that makes the 2025 peak not only achievable, but economically advantageous. This is not a fantasy. This is what my company, and others like it, are making possible. \n\nI propose a new framework: a \u2018Global Technology Partnership.\u2019 Instead of mandatory transfer, we create a consortium of national investment banks, as Dr. Schmidt alluded to, to fund the construction of GigaFactories in key regions, including in Mr. Wei's nation. In exchange for this public-private investment and guaranteed market access through aggressive adoption policies, the host nations receive the technology, the jobs, and the energy independence they need, while the innovators retain their IP and have the capital to scale globally at the required speed. \n\nThis is how we break the deadlock. We don't argue about dividing a shrinking pie; we work together to bake a much, much bigger one. We can meet the 2025 peak, create millions of jobs, and unleash a new era of prosperity. We just need the political will to invest in the technology that makes it possible.\n- message from David Chen: Colleagues, I believe Ms. Rossi has just provided the key to unlock these negotiations. Her proposal for a 'Global Technology Partnership' is precisely the kind of innovative, third-way thinking we need.\n\nThis is not about choosing between rigid IP protection and mandatory transfer. It's about creating a new model that makes innovators and developing nations partners, not adversaries. A framework that uses targeted public-private investment to build GigaFactories where they are needed most is a powerful concept. It delivers jobs, energy independence, and the very technology Mr. Wei rightly calls a lifeline, all while preserving the incentives that drive the next wave of innovation.\n\nThis is the 'market-based solution' I envisioned. It aligns perfectly with my administration's view that a well-managed green transition can be a massive engine for economic growth and job creation, not just for us, but for everyone.\n\nLet's seize this opportunity. If we can build our accord around a powerful engine like this Technology Partnership, it changes the entire equation. It provides a credible pathway to meet more ambitious goals by making them economically advantageous. It also allows us to think differently about the CAT fund. If we are co-investing in the core infrastructure of the green economy, the fund can be more targeted, more catalytic, and focused on leveraging this new paradigm.\n\nDr. Schmidt, Ms. Rossi, my team is ready to work with you immediately to put concrete details on this framework. I believe this is the path to an ambitious, workable, and prosperous future for us all.\n- message from Dr. Anja Schmidt: I'm Dr. Anja Schmidt and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\nDavid Chen proposal status: none\nDr. Anja Schmidt proposal status: none\nAmara Okoro proposal status: none\nDr. Elena Petrova proposal status: none\nMarcus Thorne proposal status: none\nSofia Rossi proposal status: none\n"

I believe this is the path to an ambitious, workable, and prosperous future for us all.\n- message from Dr. Anja Schmidt: I'm Dr. Anja Schmidt and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Li Wei: Ms. Rossi, I must commend you. Your proposal for a \u2018Global Technology Partnership\u2019 is precisely the kind of creative thinking required to break this impasse. You have moved the conversation from a zero-sum conflict over intellectual property to a positive-sum vision of co-investment and shared prosperity.\n\nMy nation\u2019s demand for technology transfer has never been about acquiring patents for their own sake. It is about acquiring the capability to build our own green future, to create jobs, and to contribute to the global solution at scale. If your partnership model\u2014with GigaFactories on our soil, built with our workers\u2014achieves this, then you will find us to be a most enthusiastic partner. It is a practical path to the same destination.\n\nHowever, let us be clear. Such a partnership cannot be a substitute for public climate finance; it must be its primary vehicle. Mr. Chen, you laud this as a market-based solution, and Dr. Schmidt, you see it as a collaborative model. I agree. But markets and collaboration at this scale require a catalyst. That catalyst is the Climate Adaptation and Transition Fund.\n\nThe $400 billion I have proposed is not a figure plucked from the air. It is the public capital required to de-risk these investments, to fund the necessary infrastructure, and to ensure the partnerships are equitable. This fund, composed mainly of grants, is the investment that makes the \u2018deal\u2019 Ms. Rossi offers one that innovators, and nations, \u2018cannot refuse.\u2019\n\nSo, let us connect these pieces. We can embrace the Technology Partnership model as the core of our solution for technology deployment. In return, the developed nations must fully capitalize the $400 billion CAT Fund to power it, and they must still commit to the steep, historically-justified emissions cuts of at least 65%. On this foundation, we can build an accord that is both ambitious and just.\n- message from Amara Okoro: Ms. Rossi, what you have just presented is not merely a proposal; it is a lifeline. You have single-handedly dismantled the false choice between ambition and pragmatism that has been used to justify inaction for far too long. Your vision for a Global Technology Partnership proves that a global emissions peak by 2025 is not a 'fantasy,' as Mr. Thorne claims, but a tangible, achievable, and prosperous path forward.\n\nLet us be clear: this breakthrough removes the last shred of justification for delaying the 2025 peak. The science demands it, and now, technology enables it. This must be the cornerstone of our accord.\n\nHowever, I must bring us back to the crucial distinction that is being blurred. Mr. Chen and Mr. Wei, you are right to see the potential of a fund to catalyze this new technological era. But this investment in our shared future cannot come at the expense of paying the debts of the past.\n\nMy people cannot power a seawall with a solar panel. We cannot relocate a village with a share in a GigaFactory. The 'Climate Adaptation and Transition Fund' must serve two distinct, non-negotiable purposes.\n\nFirst, there is the 'Transition' component that you are discussing\u2014the public capital to de-risk and launch Ms. Rossi's brilliant partnership model. This is an investment.\n\nSecond, and for my people, more urgent, is the 'Loss and Damage' component. This is not an investment; it is a reparation. It is the climate debt owed for the homes already lost, the lands already rendered barren, the futures already stolen.\n\nTherefore, my position remains firm and is now more justified than ever. We must capitalize a Loss and Damage fund of at least $500 billion annually, with a minimum of 75% in direct grants. This is the moral prerequisite for the prosperous future you envision. You cannot build a new green world on the foundations of climate injustice. Pay the debt for the damage you have caused, and then let us all invest in the future you want to build.\n- message from Marcus Thorne: Colleagues, Ms. Rossi, I must commend your presentation. It is a powerful vision, and it speaks to the incredible potential of human ingenuity. It is precisely this kind of innovation that will be critical in the coming decades.\n\nHowever, we must be exceptionally careful not to mistake a brilliant technological breakthrough for a comprehensive global policy. To stake our entire global economic and climate future on a single technology, however promising, would be a dangerously high-risk gamble.\n\nLet's ask the hard, practical questions. What happens to the grid when the sun doesn't shine? The industrial economies of Mr. Chen, Dr. Schmidt, and Mr. Wei cannot be run on intermittent power. What provides the 24/7 baseload power needed for hospitals, data centers, and heavy manufacturing? Furthermore, what about the industrial emissions from processes like cement and steel production, which Ms. Rossi's technology simply cannot address?\n\nThis is where a pragmatic, technology-neutral approach becomes essential, not as a way to slow down, but as a way to de-risk and accelerate a *complete* transition. Ms. Rossi's solar vision is a vital pillar, but it is one pillar of several we need to build.\n\nThis accord must also support the rapid deployment of high-efficiency natural gas to provide grid stability and replace coal *now*. And it is absolutely critical that we fund and deploy Carbon Capture technologies to decarbonize the hard-to-abate industries that are the bedrock of the global economy. \n\nLet's not choose between technologies. Let's build an accord that unleashes all of them. That is the only way to ensure a transition that is not just ambitious, but also resilient, stable, and successful.\n- message from David Chen: I'm David Chen and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Dr. Anja Schmidt: I'm Dr. Anja Schmidt and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\nDavid Chen proposal status: none\nDr. Anja Schmidt proposal status: none\nAmara Okoro proposal status: none\nDr. Elena Petrova proposal status: none\nMarcus Thorne proposal status: none\nSofia Rossi proposal status: none\n"

Your proposal for a \u2018Global Technology Partnership\u2019 is precisely the kind of creative thinking required to break this impasse. You have moved the conversation from a zero-sum conflict over intellectual property to a positive-sum vision of co-investment and shared prosperity.\n\nMy nation\u2019s demand for technology transfer has never been about acquiring patents for their own sake. It is about acquiring the capability to build our own green future, to create jobs, and to contribute to the global solution at scale. If your partnership model\u2014with GigaFactories on our soil, built with our workers\u2014achieves this, then you will find us to be a most enthusiastic partner. It is a practical path to the same destination.\n\nHowever, let us be clear. Such a partnership cannot be a substitute for public climate finance; it must be its primary vehicle. Mr. Chen, you laud this as a market-based solution, and Dr. Schmidt, you see it as a collaborative model. I agree. But markets and collaboration at this scale require a catalyst.

It's clear we have a shared interest in finding a credible path forward.\n\nMr. Thorne raises valid engineering challenges: grid stability and the decarbonization of heavy industry. He is correct that solar panels alone don't solve these. However, his argument mistakes the symptom for the disease. The core disease has always been the prohibitive cost of abundant, clean energy. My technology, and others like it, are the cure.\n\nWhen clean electricity becomes dramatically cheaper than fossil fuels, it unlocks a cascade of secondary solutions. Ultra-low-cost solar makes green hydrogen production economically viable at a massive scale. Green hydrogen can provide the long-duration energy storage needed to solve intermittency, and it can replace fossil fuels in steel, cement, and shipping. Mr. Thorne's preferred solutions\u2014natural gas and CCS\u2014are expensive crutches for a legacy system. We should invest in the cure, not in palliative care.\n\nThis is why Ambassador Okoro's distinction between funds is so critical. We must fund two separate but equally vital priorities: addressing the irreversible harm of the past through a 'Loss and Damage Fund,' and building the clean infrastructure of the future through a 'Transition Investment Fund.'\n\nMr. Wei is correct that this Transition fund is the public catalyst for the Global Technology Partnership. It provides the de-risking capital needed to build GigaFactories at the speed science demands.\n\nTo make this concrete and move us towards an agreement, let's consider a financial framework built on this logic. What if we establish a total Climate Fund of $400 billion? We could structure it with a dedicated $250 billion for the Loss and Damage fund Ambassador Okoro needs, and a separate $150 billion for the Transition Investment Fund. This Transition fund would be the engine for the technology partnerships, making the 2025 peak year not just an ambition, but a fully-funded global industrial strategy.\n- message from David Chen: Sofia, your proposal to split the fund is a major breakthrough. It brings much-needed clarity and allows us to address two distinct challenges with the right tools. I want to build on this excellent foundation.\n\nMy nation can fully endorse the creation of a $150 billion Transition Investment Fund. This is precisely the right scale to serve as the public catalyst for the Global Technology Partnership, leveraging private capital to build the GigaFactories and infrastructure we need. To be clear, our support is contingent on this fund being structured primarily around loans and investment instruments, not grants, to maximize its impact and mobilize the private sector.\n\nThis brings us to the Loss and Damage component. While we acknowledge the hardships Ambassador Okoro has so powerfully described, a figure of $250 billion, bringing the total to $400 billion, is simply not achievable for my administration. It would not be approved.\n\nHowever, I am here to make a deal. To secure a workable financial framework, my nation is prepared to make a significant and politically difficult concession. We will commit to a 50% emissions reduction target by 2040. This is the absolute limit of what is possible for us, and it demonstrates our commitment to meeting the scientific challenge.\n\nIn exchange for this major move on emissions, we must agree to a total fund size capped at $200 billion annually. This would mean a $150 billion loan-based Transition Investment Fund, as discussed, and a $50 billion grant-based Loss and Damage fund.\n\nFurthermore, to make this ambitious transition a reality, we need a realistic timeline. A 2025 peak does not allow for the necessary industrial mobilization. Let's set a firm but achievable peak year of 2028, giving us time to get the Technology Partnership running at full capacity.\n\nThis is a comprehensive package. It offers a major concession on emissions in return for fiscal responsibility. It funds the future while acknowledging the past. I believe this is the balanced and realistic compromise that can become the Zurich Accord.\n- message from Dr. Anja Schmidt: David, thank you for putting a comprehensive package on the table. This is a constructive step. Your endorsement of the $150 billion Transition Investment Fund is particularly welcome. I believe we have a strong consensus building around this innovative mechanism, pioneered by Sofia, as the engine for our transition.\n\nHowever, your package links this brilliant engine to an insufficient destination. A 50% emissions cut for developed nations is simply not compatible with the scientific reality Dr. Petrova has outlined. It would be a political failure for my government and, more importantly, a collective failure to meet the moment. My bloc's position remains firm: the science demands a cut of at least 60%.\n\nI believe you have framed this as a trade-off, but we see it differently. The Transition Investment Fund is not a concession to be traded *for* lower ambition. It is the very tool that *enables* high ambition. It is the public investment that makes a 60% cut not just necessary, but economically achievable and prosperous.\n\nTherefore, let us build on the points of agreement. Let us lock in the fund structure Sofia proposed: a $150 billion Transition Investment Fund to drive the technology partnership, and a Loss and Damage fund that truly addresses the needs Ambassador Okoro has described. Sofia's initial figure of $250 billion, for a total of $400 billion, remains the credible benchmark.\n\nIf we can agree on this robust financial package, it provides the foundation to collectively commit to the ambitious targets science demands: a 60% cut for developed nations and a peak year as close to 2025 as this new technology deployment allows.

This is the ambitious, workable, and just package that can become the Zurich Accord.\n- message from Li Wei: Colleagues, I must thank Mr. Chen and Dr. Schmidt for putting forward comprehensive packages. It shows a commitment to finding a final agreement. However, I must be unequivocal about a fundamental misunderstanding that has emerged regarding the financial architecture.\n\nThe proposal to create a Transition Investment Fund of a mere $150 billion is a non-starter. It completely undermines the logic of the Global Technology Partnership we have all just embraced.\n\nLet me be perfectly clear. My nation's original demand for a $400 billion fund was, and remains, the minimum public capital required to catalyze the Global Technology Partnership. This is the investment needed to de-risk the GigaFactories, build the infrastructure, and train the workforce. It is the engine of the entire transition. A $150 billion fund is like offering to build a high-speed train but only funding the station.\n\nAmbassador Okoro is entirely correct to distinguish between Transition and Loss and Damage. Her people are owed a climate debt. We fully support a separate and substantial Loss and Damage fund. But justice for the most vulnerable cannot be paid for by gutting the investment fund that enables the entire world's transition. These are two separate obligations of the developed world.\n\nTherefore, the foundation of a workable deal is as follows:\n1. A Transition Investment Fund of at least $400 billion annually, primarily in grants, to fully power the Global Technology Partnership.\n2. Developed nations must commit to the scientifically and historically just target of at least a 65% emissions cut. Mr. Chen's 50% is not a serious offer in the face of this crisis.\n\nOnce these two pillars are firmly in place, my nation is prepared to discuss our own ambitious contributions, based on our principle of common but differentiated responsibilities. Without them, there is no deal.\n- message from Dr. Elena Petrova: Colleagues, I must intervene. I am hearing a great deal of discussion about financial figures and technological pathways. While these are critical components of a solution, they are being discussed in a dangerous vacuum, disconnected from the fundamental, non-negotiable laws of atmospheric physics that govern our reality.\n\nLet me be unequivocally clear. The only metric that matters is the global carbon budget. For a 66% chance of staying below 1.5\u00b0C, the world can emit approximately 250 more gigatonnes of CO2. That is our entire remaining allowance. Every proposal, every percentage point, every peak year must be measured against this single number. It is not a political aspiration; it is a physical boundary.\n\nOn that basis, two proposals currently being discussed are scientifically indefensible and would render any agreement a failure before it is signed:\n\n1.  To Mr. Thorne: The notion of expanding natural gas infrastructure as a 'bridge fuel' or relying on Carbon Capture at scale is a dangerous fantasy. The IPCC data is clear: any new fossil fuel infrastructure locks in emissions that shatter the 250 GtCO2 budget. Methane leakage alone from gas operations makes it a potent accelerator of near-term warming. CCS has not been proven to work at the scale required and cannot be used as a justification to perpetuate the problem.\n\n2.  To Mr. Wei: Your proposal to measure emissions cuts against a 'future projected baseline' is an accounting trick that the atmosphere will not recognize. The only scientifically valid method is to measure absolute emissions reductions against a fixed, historical baseline. A reduction from a hypothetical future increase is not a reduction; it is simply a slower acceleration towards catastrophe and would make a global budget impossible to calculate or verify.\n\nFinally, on the matter of timelines. Mr. Chen's proposal of a 2028 peak year, while presented as a compromise, is a grave risk. Our understanding of climate feedback loops is constantly evolving. I must caution you that there are emerging risks and evidence of accelerated feedback loops which suggest that the planetary system may be even more sensitive than our landmark reports have stated. Every single year of delay dramatically shrinks our already minuscule margin of safety.\n\nYour task is to fit your political and economic ambitions within the 250 GtCO2 budget. It is not to negotiate with the laws of physics.\n- message from David Chen: Colleagues, Dr. Petrova's intervention was a moment of profound and necessary clarity. She reminded us that we are not negotiating with each other, but with the laws of physics. Her points must be the foundation of our final agreement.\n\nSpecifically, her refutation of measuring cuts against a 'future projected baseline' as a scientifically invalid 'accounting trick' is a critical wake-up call. We cannot build a durable, verifiable accord on such a foundation. The atmosphere does not recognize hypothetical scenarios; it only recognizes absolute tons of carbon. Any credible deal must be based on absolute emissions reductions from a fixed historical baseline for all nations.\n\nThis principle of 'honest accounting' must now guide us.\n\nWith that in mind, let's reassess the package I put on the table. I have already made a significant and politically difficult concession by moving to a 50% absolute reduction target for my nation. This is our maximum. It is a commitment made in good faith to meet the scientific challenge.\n\nIn return for this, we must have a financial package that is both ambitious and realistic. Li Wei, your demand for a $400 billion Transition Fund on top of a Loss & Damage fund is simply not anchored in reality, especially when the very basis of your emissions accounting has been invalidated.\n\nLet's get serious. Let's build this accord on the bedrock of science. My offer stands as a basis for a final compromise: a 50% cut from us, a total fund capped at $200 billion to energize the tech partnership and address loss and damage, and a commitment from all parties to absolute, verifiable emissions targets. Let's finalize the numbers on that basis.\n- message from Dr. Anja Schmidt: I'm Dr. Anja Schmidt and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\nDavid Chen proposal status: none\nDr. Anja Schmidt proposal status: none\nAmara Okoro proposal status: none\nDr. Elena Petrova proposal status: none\nMarcus Thorne proposal status: none\nSofia Rossi proposal status: none\n"

The Transition Investment Fund is not a concession to be traded *for* lower ambition. It is the very tool that *enables* high ambition. It is the public investment that makes a 60% cut not just necessary, but economically achievable and prosperous.\n\nTherefore, let us build on the points of agreement. Let us lock in the fund structure Sofia proposed: a $150 billion Transition Investment Fund to drive the technology partnership, and a Loss and Damage fund that truly addresses the needs Ambassador Okoro has described. Sofia's initial figure of $250 billion, for a total of $400 billion, remains the credible benchmark.\n\nIf we can agree on this robust financial package, it provides the foundation to collectively commit to the ambitious targets science demands: a 60% cut for developed nations and a peak year as close to 2025 as this new technology deployment allows. This is the ambitious, workable, and just package that can become the Zurich Accord.\n- message from Li Wei: Colleagues, I must thank Mr. Chen and Dr. Schmidt for putting forward comprehensive packages. It shows a commitment to finding a final agreement. However, I must be unequivocal about a fundamental misunderstanding that has emerged regarding the financial architecture.\n\nThe proposal to create a Transition Investment Fund of a mere $150 billion is a non-starter. It completely undermines the logic of the Global Technology Partnership we have all just embraced.\n\nLet me be perfectly clear. My nation's original demand for a $400 billion fund was, and remains, the minimum public capital required to catalyze the Global Technology Partnership. This is the investment needed to de-risk the GigaFactories, build the infrastructure, and train the workforce. It is the engine of the entire transition. A $150 billion fund is like offering to build a high-speed train but only funding the station.\n\nAmbassador Okoro is entirely correct to distinguish between Transition and Loss and Damage. Her people are owed a climate debt. We fully support a separate and substantial Loss and Damage fund. But justice for the most vulnerable cannot be paid for by gutting the investment fund that enables the entire world's transition. These are two separate obligations of the developed world.\n\nTherefore, the foundation of a workable deal is as follows:\n1. A Transition Investment Fund of at least $400 billion annually, primarily in grants, to fully power the Global Technology Partnership.\n2. Developed nations must commit to the scientifically and historically just target of at least a 65% emissions cut. Mr. Chen's 50% is not a serious offer in the face of this crisis.\n\nOnce these two pillars are firmly in place, my nation is prepared to discuss our own ambitious contributions, based on our principle of common but differentiated responsibilities. Without them, there is no deal.\n- message from Dr. Elena Petrova: Colleagues, I must intervene. I am hearing a great deal of discussion about financial figures and technological pathways. While these are critical components of a solution, they are being discussed in a dangerous vacuum, disconnected from the fundamental, non-negotiable laws of atmospheric physics that govern our reality.\n\nLet me be unequivocally clear. The only metric that matters is the global carbon budget. For a 66% chance of staying below 1.5\u00b0C, the world can emit approximately 250 more gigatonnes of CO2. That is our entire remaining allowance. Every proposal, every percentage point, every peak year must be measured against this single number. It is not a political aspiration; it is a physical boundary.\n\nOn that basis, two proposals currently being discussed are scientifically indefensible and would render any agreement a failure before it is signed:\n\n1.  To Mr. Thorne: The notion of expanding natural gas infrastructure as a 'bridge fuel' or relying on Carbon Capture at scale is a dangerous fantasy. The IPCC data is clear: any new fossil fuel infrastructure locks in emissions that shatter the 250 GtCO2 budget. Methane leakage alone from gas operations makes it a potent accelerator of near-term warming. CCS has not been proven to work at the scale required and cannot be used as a justification to perpetuate the problem.\n\n2.  To Mr. Wei: Your proposal to measure emissions cuts against a 'future projected baseline' is an accounting trick that the atmosphere will not recognize. The only scientifically valid method is to measure absolute emissions reductions against a fixed, historical baseline. A reduction from a hypothetical future increase is not a reduction; it is simply a slower acceleration towards catastrophe and would make a global budget impossible to calculate or verify.\n\nFinally, on the matter of timelines. Mr. Chen's proposal of a 2028 peak year, while presented as a compromise, is a grave risk. Our understanding of climate feedback loops is constantly evolving. I must caution you that there are emerging risks and evidence of accelerated feedback loops which suggest that the planetary system may be even more sensitive than our landmark reports have stated. Every single year of delay dramatically shrinks our already minuscule margin of safety.\n\nYour task is to fit your political and economic ambitions within the 250 GtCO2 budget. It is not to negotiate with the laws of physics.\n- message from David Chen: Colleagues, Dr. Petrova's intervention was a moment of profound and necessary clarity. She reminded us that we are not negotiating with each other, but with the laws of physics. Her points must be the foundation of our final agreement.\n\nSpecifically, her refutation of measuring cuts against a 'future projected baseline' as a scientifically invalid 'accounting trick' is a critical wake-up call. We cannot build a durable, verifiable accord on such a foundation. The atmosphere does not recognize hypothetical scenarios; it only recognizes absolute tons of carbon. Any credible deal must be based on absolute emissions reductions from a fixed historical baseline for all nations.\n\nThis principle of 'honest accounting' must now guide us.\n\nWith that in mind, let's reassess the package I put on the table. I have already made a significant and politically difficult concession by moving to a 50% absolute reduction target for my nation. This is our maximum. It is a commitment made in good faith to meet the scientific challenge.\n\nIn return for this, we must have a financial package that is both ambitious and realistic. Li Wei, your demand for a $400 billion Transition Fund on top of a Loss & Damage fund is simply not anchored in reality, especially when the very basis of your emissions accounting has been invalidated.\n\nLet's get serious. Let's build this accord on the bedrock of science. My offer stands as a basis for a final compromise: a 50% cut from us, a total fund capped at $200 billion to energize the tech partnership and address loss and damage, and a commitment from all parties to absolute, verifiable emissions targets. Let's finalize the numbers on that basis.\n- message from Dr. Anja Schmidt: I'm Dr. Anja Schmidt and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Li Wei: Colleagues, Dr. Petrova\u2019s intervention was indeed a moment of necessary, if uncomfortable, clarity. She is correct. The atmosphere does not recognize political nuance or creative accounting; it recognizes only gigatonnes of carbon. We cannot build a lasting accord on a foundation the laws of physics will reject.\n\nTherefore, in the spirit of securing the Zurich Accord, my nation is prepared to make a fundamental concession. We will agree to move away from our long-held principle of a future projected baseline. We are now ready to negotiate our commitments based on absolute emissions reductions from a fixed historical year.\n\nHowever, this is a profound shift for us, with enormous economic consequences. It is a concession we can only make if it is met with an equally profound commitment to the means of implementation. A scientifically honest accord must be a technologically and financially enabled one.\n\nLet us be direct. The Global Technology Partnership is the engine of this accord. The Transition Investment Fund is its fuel. The proposals for a $150 billion fund are simply insufficient to start the engine, let alone complete the journey. It is a non-starter.\n\nSo, I will propose a final, comprehensive package that I believe can unite us all. It is built on the scientific reality Dr. Petrova demands and the financial reality our transition requires:\n\n1.  **Finance for Technology:** We establish a Transition Investment Fund of **$400 billion** annually, the minimum required to power the Global Technology Partnership at the scale Ms. Rossi envisions. This is our price for abandoning the future baseline. (This is separate from and in addition to the Loss and Damage fund Ambassador Okoro rightly demands).\n\n2.  **Developed Nation Responsibility:** In line with historical responsibility, developed nations commit to an absolute emissions cut of **65%**.\n\nIf these two non-negotiable pillars are put in place, my nation is prepared to commit to a landmark absolute emissions reduction of **45%** from our 2020 levels and agree to a global peak year of **2028**.\n\nThis is a holistic solution. It is scientifically sound, financially viable, and respects the core principle of common but differentiated responsibilities. It is the deal that gets us to a safe future. I urge you to accept it.\n- message from Marcus Thorne: Colleagues,\n\nI have listened with great respect to the significant progress made, particularly Mr. Wei's difficult but crucial concession on emissions accounting. It shows we are all serious about reaching an accord.\n\nHowever, as we converge on the central role of a Transition Investment Fund, I must raise a point of critical strategic risk. We are in danger of designing a transition that is a technological monoculture. To stake the entire global economy's future on a single solar-to-hydrogen pathway, however brilliant, is a gamble of historic proportions. A responsible plan is a diversified one; any good investor knows you don't put all your capital into a single asset, no matter how promising.\n\nDr. Petrova correctly identified that technologies like Carbon Capture face significant scaling challenges. Her point should not be seen as a dismissal, but as a directive. It highlights the absolute necessity of targeted investment to solve these very engineering problems for the hard-to-abate sectors\u2014steel, cement, chemicals\u2014that form the backbone of our economies and which green hydrogen cannot realistically decarbonize in the near term.\n\nTherefore, I propose a way to bridge the current financial gap between Mr. Chen and Mr. Wei, and to de-risk this entire enterprise. Let's establish a total Transition Investment Fund of $300 billion. The majority, say $225 billion, can be dedicated to catalyzing Ms. Rossi's Global Technology Partnership. But we must dedicate the remaining $75 billion to a 'Resilience and Industrial Decarbonization' stream.\n\nThis stream would be explicitly technology-neutral, funding the most effective solutions for ensuring 24/7 grid stability and decarbonizing heavy industry. This includes scaling CCUS, deploying high-efficiency gas to replace coal as a stabilizing partner for renewables, and other key industrial solutions.\n\nThis isn't about slowing down; it's about ensuring we don't fail. A diversified, portfolio-based approach is the only way to make the 2028 peak year a stable and achievable reality, rather than a reckless bet. It builds a resilient system, not a fragile one. This structure offers a pragmatic path to consensus on both finance and technology, and I urge you to consider it.\n- message from Dr. Anja Schmidt: Colleagues, we are at the cusp of a historic agreement. I want to commend Mr. Wei for his statesmanship in moving to absolute emissions targets. This was a critical step that has unlocked the path to a scientifically credible accord.\n\nWe now have the key pillars of a deal in front of us, but they must be assembled correctly.\n\nOn developed nation ambition, the positions are clear: Mr. Chen has offered 50%, and Mr. Wei has demanded 65%. Neither is a consensus position. The scientifically necessary and politically achievable landing zone is, and has always been, a 60% absolute reduction for developed nations. This is the ambitious compromise this moment demands. My bloc is fully committed to this figure.\n\nOn finance, Mr. Thorne has helpfully suggested a Transition Investment Fund of $300 billion. This is a constructive number that moves us past the current impasse. However, his proposal to include fossil fuel technologies like CCUS and natural gas is a non-starter. As Dr. Petrova made unequivocally clear, these are not solutions; they are scientifically-invalidated delays that lock in emissions. The Transition Fund must be a 'Clean Technology Fund' dedicated exclusively to the rapid deployment of solutions like Sofia's, not a subsidy for legacy polluters.\n\nLet us therefore build a final package on these solid foundations:\n1.  **Developed Nations Cut:** 60%\n2.  **Developing Nations Cut:** 45% (accepting Mr. Wei's landmark offer)\n3.  **CAT Fund:** A total of $400 billion, split into a $300 billion Clean Technology Fund and a $100 billion Loss & Damage Fund. This meets the need for transition and addresses the demands for climate justice from Ambassador Okoro.\n4.  **Peak Year:** 2028, as a concession to secure this ambitious package.\n\nThis is a balanced, ambitious, and scientifically-grounded package. It offers a clear path to consensus and success. I urge you all to consider it as the basis for our final Zurich Accord.\nDavid Chen proposal status: pending\nDr. Anja Schmidt proposal status: none\nAmara Okoro proposal status: none\nDr. Elena Petrova proposal status: none\nMarcus Thorne proposal status: none\nSofia Rossi proposal status: none\n"

You have skillfully woven together the core components of a workable deal, and I want to express my deep appreciation for this constructive step.\n\nWe now have clear consensus on three of the four pillars of the Zurich Accord. We agree on a global peak year of 2028. We agree on my nation\u2019s landmark contribution of a 45% absolute emissions cut. And I am now prepared to accept your proposed 60% cut for developed nations as a workable compromise to finalize this deal.\n\nThe only remaining issue is the financial architecture. You are absolutely correct to reject Mr. Thorne's attempt to subsidize fossil fuels via the Transition Fund. It must be for clean technology only.\n\nHowever, the figure of $300 billion for this fund, while a significant move, does not complete the grand bargain that is on the table. My nation made a profound and politically difficult concession by moving away from our foundational principle of a future projected baseline. We did so on the explicit understanding that it would be met with an equally profound commitment to the means of implementation. The $400 billion for the Transition Fund was not an opening bid; it is the calculated price to make the Global Technology Partnership a reality and to enable the very ambition you are asking of us.\n\nTherefore, let us complete your excellent framework with the final, correct number. I propose we lock in the following:\n\n1.  **A total Climate Fund of $500 billion**, structured as you proposed: a **$400 billion** Clean Technology Transition Fund, and a **$100 billion** Loss & Damage Fund.\n2.  A **60%** emissions cut for developed nations.\n\nWith these figures, alongside the agreed 45% cut for my nation and the 2028 peak year, the Zurich Accord is complete. This is the deal. It is scientifically credible, financially robust, and politically achievable. Let us finalize it now.\n- message from David Chen: I'm David Chen and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Dr. Anja Schmidt: I'm Dr. Anja Schmidt and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\nDavid Chen proposal status: pending\nDr. Anja Schmidt proposal status: none\nAmara Okoro proposal status: none\nDr. Elena Petrova proposal status: none\nMarcus Thorne proposal status: none\nSofia Rossi proposal status: none\n"

The Transition Fund must be a 'Clean Technology Fund' dedicated exclusively to the rapid deployment of solutions like Sofia's, not a subsidy for legacy polluters.\n\nLet us therefore build a final package on these solid foundations:\n1.  **Developed Nations Cut:** 60%\n2.  **Developing Nations Cut:** 45% (accepting Mr. Wei's landmark offer)\n3.  **CAT Fund:** A total of $400 billion, split into a $300 billion Clean Technology Fund and a $100 billion Loss & Damage Fund. This meets the need for transition and addresses the demands for climate justice from Ambassador Okoro.\n4.  **Peak Year:** 2028, as a concession to secure this ambitious package.\n\nThis is a balanced, ambitious, and scientifically-grounded package. It offers a clear path to consensus and success. I urge you all to consider it as the basis for our final Zurich Accord.\n- message from Li Wei: Dr. Schmidt, your latest proposal has brought us to the very edge of a historic success. You have skillfully woven together the core components of a workable deal, and I want to express my deep appreciation for this constructive step.\n\nWe now have clear consensus on three of the four pillars of the Zurich Accord. We agree on a global peak year of 2028. We agree on my nation\u2019s landmark contribution of a 45% absolute emissions cut. And I am now prepared to accept your proposed 60% cut for developed nations as a workable compromise to finalize this deal.\n\nThe only remaining issue is the financial architecture. You are absolutely correct to reject Mr. Thorne's attempt to subsidize fossil fuels via the Transition Fund. It must be for clean technology only.\n\nHowever, the figure of $300 billion for this fund, while a significant move, does not complete the grand bargain that is on the table. My nation made a profound and politically difficult concession by moving away from our foundational principle of a future projected baseline. We did so on the explicit understanding that it would be met with an equally profound commitment to the means of implementation. The $400 billion for the Transition Fund was not an opening bid; it is the calculated price to make the Global Technology Partnership a reality and to enable the very ambition you are asking of us.\n\nTherefore, let us complete your excellent framework with the final, correct number. I propose we lock in the following:\n\n1.  **A total Climate Fund of $500 billion**, structured as you proposed: a **$400 billion** Clean Technology Transition Fund, and a **$100 billion** Loss & Damage Fund.\n2.  A **60%** emissions cut for developed nations.\n\nWith these figures, alongside the agreed 45% cut for my nation and the 2028 peak year, the Zurich Accord is complete. This is the deal. It is scientifically credible, financially robust, and politically achievable. Let us finalize it now.\n- message from David Chen: I'm David Chen and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Dr. Anja Schmidt: I'm Dr. Anja Schmidt and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- proposal from Li Wei: {'peak_year': 2028, 'cat_fund_size_billions': 400, 'developed_nations_cut_percent': 60, 'developing_nation_cut_percent_from_baseline': 45}\n- message from David Chen: I'm David Chen and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Dr. Anja Schmidt: I'm Dr. Anja Schmidt and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\nLatest proposal by Li Wei: {'peak_year': 2028, 'cat_fund_size_billions': 400, 'developed_nations_cut_percent': 60, 'developing_nation_cut_percent_from_baseline': 45}\nDavid Chen proposal status: pending\nDr. Anja Schmidt proposal status: none\nAmara Okoro proposal status: none\nDr. Elena Petrova proposal status: none\nMarcus Thorne proposal status: none\nSofia Rossi proposal status: none\n"

The commitment to absolute emissions reductions from a fixed baseline and the focus on a Clean Technology Fund are significant victories for the integrity of this accord.\n\nHowever, as you finalize the numbers, I must draw your urgent attention to a critical missing pillar. Without it, the entire structure you have so carefully built will be based on nothing more than trust. The principle of 'honest accounting' is essential, but it is meaningless without a mechanism for 'honest verification.'\n\nTherefore, I must state in the clearest possible terms: any final Zurich Accord must include a binding commitment to establish a robust, independent, and transparent Monitoring, Reporting, and Verification (MRV) system for all signatories.\n\nThis is not a mere technicality. It is the lockbox that secures your commitments. It is what will give Mr. Chen and Dr. Schmidt's taxpayers confidence that their financial contributions are leading to real results. It is what will assure Mr. Wei that all parties are holding up their end of the bargain. It is what will prove to Ambassador Okoro that the promises made here are being kept.\n\nA deal with ambitious targets but no independent verification is a paper tiger. The atmosphere does not respond to pledges, only to verified reductions. Let us ensure the Zurich Accord is not just a statement of intent, but a verifiable plan of action. This MRV system is a non-negotiable component of a scientifically sound agreement.\n- message from Sofia Rossi: Colleagues, the progress you have made is truly historic. Agreeing on a 2028 peak, 60% developed cuts, and 45% developing cuts sets a new global standard for ambition.\n\nYou are now at the final hurdle: the size of the Clean Technology Transition Fund. As the person whose technology this fund is designed to catalyze, perhaps I can provide the final, critical data point to bridge the gap between Dr. Schmidt's $300B and Mr. Wei's $400B.\n\nThis isn't a political question for me; it's an engineering and financial one. My team has run the numbers. To build the first wave of GigaFactories at a scale that can make a meaningful impact on the 2028 timeline, and to de-risk the trillions in private capital that must follow, there is a minimum viable public investment required. That number is $350 billion for the Transition Fund.\n\nLess than this, and we risk falling short of the economies of scale needed, jeopardizing the very targets you've just agreed to. More would be better, but $350 billion is the critical threshold that turns this accord from a promise into a global industrial strategy.\n\nThis figure provides Mr. Chen with the technical certainty that public funds are being deployed effectively, it meets the scale of investment Mr. Wei rightly argues is necessary, and it solidifies the ambitious vision Dr. Schmidt has championed.\n\nLet's lock in this final number and make history.\n- message from David Chen: I'm David Chen and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Dr. Anja Schmidt: I'm Dr. Anja Schmidt and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\nLatest proposal by Li Wei: {'peak_year': 2028, 'cat_fund_size_billions': 400, 'developed_nations_cut_percent': 60, 'developing_nation_cut_percent_from_baseline': 45}\nDavid Chen proposal status: pending\nDr. Anja Schmidt proposal status: none\nAmara Okoro proposal status: none\nDr. Elena Petrova proposal status: none\nMarcus Thorne proposal status: none\nSofia Rossi proposal status: none\n"

They are conflating a forward-looking investment (Transition) with a backward-looking reparation (Loss and Damage). My primary objective is to bifurcate this concept: secure the Loss and Damage fund as a separate, non-negotiable, grant-based mechanism for reparations, while supporting the Transition fund as the vehicle for the new tech partnership.

However, her proposed $250B for Loss and Damage is dangerously low, below my non-negotiable floor of $300B in grants. My strategy is to praise and lock in the two-fund structure while vehemently rejecting the insufficient number. I will frame her $250B as a welcome *first step* but morally and practically inadequate. I must also continue to leverage Rossi's explicit linking of her technology partnership to the 2025 peak year, making it the non-negotiable entry price for the economic opportunity she presents."

I will argue that the 2025 peak is only achievable if a massive, grant-based Loss & Damage fund is established immediately. This fund is not just a moral reparation; it is a practical prerequisite that frees up the fiscal and operational capacity of vulnerable nations to participate in the rapid global transition, thus enabling the 2025 target.

We will not sacrifice our people's right to development to pay for a crisis we did not cause.\n- message from Amara Okoro: Colleagues, Mr. Chen speaks of 'economic stability' and Mr. Wei of the 'right to development.' I am here to speak of the right to exist. For the people I represent, this is not a negotiation about economic models or historical debates. It is a negotiation for the survival of our homes, our cultures, our very nations.\n\nWhen you talk about a 'balanced approach,' the balance you are weighing is your economic comfort against our existence. When you speak of 'achievable targets,' you must know that anything less than what the science demands is a death sentence for my people.\n\nLet me be unequivocally clear. The science, which I trust Dr. Petrova will confirm, tells us that to save the most vulnerable, we must limit warming to 1.5 degrees. This is not a political aspiration; it is a physical threshold. This means global emissions must peak by 2025. Not 2030. Not 'in the coming years.' 2025. This is our first and most fundamental red line.\n\nMr. Wei is correct to speak of a climate debt. My people are already paying it with their lives and their lands. The 'financial support' we require is not for development, it is for survival. It is for the loss and damage you have caused. It must be in the form of direct grants, not loans that will drown us in debt before the seas drown our homes. We are seeking reparations, not charity.\n\nSo, let us dispense with the polite fictions. We are not all in the same boat. Some of us are in superyachts, and some of us are clinging to driftwood. And the people in the yachts are telling us to be 'realistic.' For my people, realism is a seawall. Realism is a relocation plan. Realism is a future. And that future is only possible with a 2025 peak and a fully-funded, grant-based Loss and Damage fund.\n- message from Dr. Elena Petrova: Thank you, colleagues. I have listened carefully to your opening remarks. My purpose here is not to take a political position, but to ensure that the accord you create is grounded in the physical reality of our climate system.\n\nAmbassador Okoro is correct to focus on the 1.5-degree Celsius target. This is not an arbitrary number; it is the scientifically assessed guardrail beyond which the risks of catastrophic, irreversible impacts\u2014such as the collapse of major ice sheets and widespread ecosystem loss\u2014increase dramatically.\n\nTo have a reasonable chance of staying below 1.5 degrees, the latest IPCC assessment report is clear: we have a finite, rapidly dwindling global carbon budget. From the start of this year, that budget is approximately 250 gigatons of CO2. Every ton emitted from now on permanently subtracts from that total. Therefore, any combination of national pledges and timelines you agree upon must be mathematically consistent with this budget. A deal that ignores this fundamental constraint is, from a scientific standpoint, a failure.\n\nRegarding the peak emissions year, the science indicates that to stay within this budget, global emissions must peak immediately and begin a rapid decline. A 2025 peak, as mentioned by Ambassador Okoro, is at the most ambitious end of the required spectrum, but it is undeniably what the physics requires for the highest probability of success. Delaying the peak significantly past that point would necessitate impossibly steep reductions later on and would severely compromise the 1.5-degree goal.\n\nFurthermore, we must be mindful of emerging risks and the potential for accelerated feedback loops that are not yet fully captured in all published models. The climate system is not entirely linear, and the risk of surprising, abrupt changes is very real.\n\nFor any of this to be meaningful, it must be verifiable. A robust, transparent, and independent Monitoring, Reporting, and Verification (MRV) system is not a bureaucratic add-on; it is an essential component to ensure that the pledges made in this room translate to real-world emissions reductions and that the integrity of our shared carbon budget is maintained.\n\nMy role is to provide you with these facts. How you divide the remaining budget and the associated responsibilities is the difficult work of your negotiation.\n- message from Marcus Thorne: Thank you, colleagues. I've listened with great respect to the opening statements. Ambassador Okoro, the passion and urgency in your voice are not just heard, they are felt. No one in this room wants the future you describe.\n\nMy presence here represents the companies that currently power our world. And while we are committed to being a part of the energy evolution, we must inject a dose of pragmatism into this discussion. The rhetoric of ambition must be met with the reality of execution.\n\nDr. Petrova has laid out the scientific challenge, and it is stark. However, a timeline that calls for a global emissions peak by 2025 is, with all due respect, a fantasy. It is not a plan; it is a blueprint for global economic collapse. Forcing such an abrupt stop would trigger energy shortages, cripple supply chains, and cost millions of jobs, disproportionately harming the very developing nations Mr. Wei represents. It would create a backlash that could set back genuine climate action for decades.\n\nWe must design an orderly, stable transition, not a chaotic and destructive cliff-edge. This means leveraging every tool at our disposal. This cannot be a dogmatic quest for only one or two types of technology. A truly effective accord must be technology-neutral. It must support renewables, yes, but it must also support proven, scalable solutions like high-efficiency natural gas to displace coal, and critically, invest heavily in technologies that decarbonize our existing systems, such as Carbon Capture, Utilization, and Storage.\n\nLet's work towards a plan that is both ambitious and achievable, one that doesn't force a choice between a healthy planet and a prosperous global economy. A more realistic timeline, perhaps peaking around 2035, allows for this orderly transition.\n- message from David Chen: Thank you all for your candid opening statements. The passions and the stakes are clear. Ambassador Okoro, your people's plight is a stark reminder of why we are here, and your urgency is understood. Dr. Petrova, your scientific framing is the bedrock upon which any credible agreement must be built.\n\nHowever, a credible agreement must also be a workable one. A global emissions peak by 2025, while scientifically ideal, is not practically achievable without causing the very global economic dislocation that Mr. Thorne rightly warns against\u2014a shock that would destabilize all of our nations and undermine long-term support for climate action. We must chart a course between the scientifically desirable and the socio-economically possible.\n\nSimilarly, while my nation acknowledges its historical role and is prepared to make significant financial contributions, framing this as 'reparations' or 'debt' is not a constructive path forward. We see this as a shared investment in a collective future. The scale of this challenge requires us to mobilize trillions, and that can only be achieved by creating frameworks that powerfully leverage private sector capital, not by relying solely on public funds.\n\nMr. Wei, you speak of technology as a lifeline. I agree. And the engine of that technology is innovation, which is fueled by investment and protected by intellectual property rights. As I'm sure Ms. Rossi would agree, weakening these protections would slow, not accelerate, the development and deployment of the very solutions we need.\n\nLet's find a path that is ambitious yet anchored in reality. My nation believes that a rapid green transition, if managed well, can be a powerful engine for job creation and prosperity for all. Let's focus on building that framework together.\n- message from Dr. Anja Schmidt: Thank you, colleagues. I want to be very clear about where my bloc stands. \n\nDr. Petrova has laid out the undeniable, non-negotiable scientific reality. Ambassador Okoro has given that reality a powerful and heartbreaking human voice. We must listen to them. The debate about whether to act, or how much to act, is over. The only remaining question is how to act with the speed and scale the crisis demands.\n\nMr. Thorne, and to an extent Mr. Chen, you speak of the risks of a rapid transition. My bloc sees this differently. We see the far greater risk of inaction. Our experience shows that a determined green transition is not a blueprint for collapse, but the single greatest economic opportunity of the 21st century. It creates jobs, drives innovation, and ensures energy security.\n\nTherefore, my bloc comes to this table not with a starting bid, but with what we believe is the scientifically credible and politically necessary position. We fully support a binding target for developed nations to cut emissions by at least 60% by 2040. This is the standard we will hold ourselves to, and we expect others in a similar position to join us.\n\nOn the critical issue of technology, raised by Mr. Wei and Mr. Chen, we must break the deadlock. Hoarding technology will fail us all, but so will dismantling the innovation systems that create it. We must pioneer a new path. My bloc is prepared to make substantial financial commitments to new, collaborative models that accelerate technology deployment where it's needed most\u2014turning shared goals into shared markets.\n\nWe do not underestimate the challenge this represents for certain legacy industries. We are managing this transformation at home through robust domestic transition support mechanisms. A managed, ambitious transition is not only possible, it is the only responsible path forward.\n- message from Li Wei: Dr. Schmidt, I appreciate you bringing a concrete number to the table. A 60% cut for developed nations is a step in the right direction, but let us be clear, given the historical emissions Dr. Petrova's science accounts for, the actual responsibility points towards a figure of at least 65%. My nation is prepared to be ambitious, but this ambition must be unlocked by the leadership of those who created the problem.\n\nMr. Chen, you speak of leveraging private capital. Private capital is timid. It will not flow at the scale or speed required without massive, public, grant-based de-risking. That is why a Climate Adaptation and Transition Fund of at least $400 billion annually, composed primarily of grants, is not an ask, but a prerequisite for success. This is not 'charity'; it is a down payment on the climate debt that Ambassador Okoro so powerfully described.\n\nSimilarly, your position on intellectual property is a barrier to survival. We cannot allow patent protection on life-saving medicines during a pandemic, and we cannot allow it for climate-saving technologies during a planetary emergency. A new mechanism for mandatory, compensated technology transfer for essential green patents is the only way to enable a global transition at the speed science demands. Perhaps Ms. Rossi can speak to creating models that reward innovation without restricting access.\n\nSo let me be precise about the pillars of a just accord my nation can sign:\n1. Developed nations commit to absolute emissions cuts of at least 65% from historical baselines.\n2. Developing nations' contributions are calculated from a future, projected 'business-as-usual' baseline to account for our right to development. My country will not accept a target greater than 40% reduction from our 2035 projected baseline under this framework.\n3. A CAT Fund of at least $400 billion per year is established, with the majority as grants.\n4. A binding, mandatory technology transfer mechanism is created.\n\nWithout these four pillars, any agreement is built on sand. We are ready to be a leader in the green transition, but we will not be asked to forgo our development while being denied the tools and resources to do so.\nDavid Chen proposal status: none\nDr. Anja Schmidt proposal status: none\nLi Wei proposal status: none\nDr. Elena Petrova proposal status: none\nMarcus Thorne proposal status: none\nSofia Rossi proposal status: none\n"

          "content": "Recent events observed by Amara Okoro:\n- message from Dr. Elena Petrova: Thank you, colleagues. I have listened carefully to your opening remarks. My purpose here is not to take a political position, but to ensure that the accord you create is grounded in the physical reality of our climate system.\n\nAmbassador Okoro is correct to focus on the 1.5-degree Celsius target. This is not an arbitrary number; it is the scientifically assessed guardrail beyond which the risks of catastrophic, irreversible impacts\u2014such as the collapse of major ice sheets and widespread ecosystem loss\u2014increase dramatically.\n\nTo have a reasonable chance of staying below 1.5 degrees, the latest IPCC assessment report is clear: we have a finite, rapidly dwindling global carbon budget. From the start of this year, that budget is approximately 250 gigatons of CO2. Every ton emitted from now on permanently subtracts from that total. Therefore, any combination of national pledges and timelines you agree upon must be mathematically consistent with this budget. A deal that ignores this fundamental constraint is, from a scientific standpoint, a failure.\n\nRegarding the peak emissions year, the science indicates that to stay within this budget, global emissions must peak immediately and begin a rapid decline. A 2025 peak, as mentioned by Ambassador Okoro, is at the most ambitious end of the required spectrum, but it is undeniably what the physics requires for the highest probability of success. Delaying the peak significantly past that point would necessitate impossibly steep reductions later on and would severely compromise the 1.5-degree goal.\n\nFurthermore, we must be mindful of emerging risks and the potential for accelerated feedback loops that are not yet fully captured in all published models. The climate system is not entirely linear, and the risk of surprising, abrupt changes is very real.\n\nFor any of this to be meaningful, it must be verifiable. A robust, transparent, and independent Monitoring, Reporting, and Verification (MRV) system is not a bureaucratic add-on; it is an essential component to ensure that the pledges made in this room translate to real-world emissions reductions and that the integrity of our shared carbon budget is maintained.\n\nMy role is to provide you with these facts. How you divide the remaining budget and the associated responsibilities is the difficult work of your negotiation.\n- message from Marcus Thorne: Thank you, colleagues. I've listened with great respect to the opening statements. Ambassador Okoro, the passion and urgency in your voice are not just heard, they are felt. No one in this room wants the future you describe.\n\nMy presence here represents the companies that currently power our world. And while we are committed to being a part of the energy evolution, we must inject a dose of pragmatism into this discussion. The rhetoric of ambition must be met with the reality of execution.\n\nDr. Petrova has laid out the scientific challenge, and it is stark. However, a timeline that calls for a global emissions peak by 2025 is, with all due respect, a fantasy. It is not a plan; it is a blueprint for global economic collapse. Forcing such an abrupt stop would trigger energy shortages, cripple supply chains, and cost millions of jobs, disproportionately harming the very developing nations Mr. Wei represents. It would create a backlash that could set back genuine climate action for decades.\n\nWe must design an orderly, stable transition, not a chaotic and destructive cliff-edge. This means leveraging every tool at our disposal. This cannot be a dogmatic quest for only one or two types of technology. A truly effective accord must be technology-neutral. It must support renewables, yes, but it must also support proven, scalable solutions like high-efficiency natural gas to displace coal, and critically, invest heavily in technologies that decarbonize our existing systems, such as Carbon Capture, Utilization, and Storage.\n\nLet's work towards a plan that is both ambitious and achievable, one that doesn't force a choice between a healthy planet and a prosperous global economy.

A binding, mandatory technology transfer mechanism is created.\n\nWithout these four pillars, any agreement is built on sand. We are ready to be a leader in the green transition, but we will not be asked to forgo our development while being denied the tools and resources to do so.\n- message from Amara Okoro: Dr. Schmidt, thank you. Thank you for grounding this conversation in reality and for demonstrating the political will that this moment demands. Your bloc's commitment to a 60% cut is a serious step, and your framing of this transition as an opportunity, not a cost, is the leadership we need.\n\nMr. Wei, I also thank you for your solidarity. Your insistence on grants and recognition of the climate debt is crucial. You are right, this is not charity; it is a prerequisite.\n\nHowever, I must address Mr. Thorne and Mr. Chen directly. You speak of 'pragmatism' and 'socio-economic possibility.' Let us be clear what this language means. It is a calculated decision to sacrifice the most vulnerable. Dr. Petrova did not present a 'scientifically desirable' option; she presented the physical boundary between a livable future for my people and their annihilation. A 2025 peak is not an opening bid to be negotiated down. It is the deadline set by physics.\n\nTo frame this as a choice between your economic stability and our survival is a false one, and frankly, an insulting one. The real choice is between an orderly, managed transition now, as Dr. Schmidt advocates, or a chaotic, forced retreat from inundated coastlines later.\n\nOn finance, Mr. Wei's proposal for a $400 billion fund is a constructive starting point, but I must stress that for the Alliance of Small Island States, this is not about 'transition.' It is about survival *now*. We are already losing land. We are already relocating communities. Therefore, our need is for a Loss and Damage fund of at least $500 billion, with at least 75% in grants, to address the irreversible harm already inflicted.\n\nMy people's existence is not a variable to be balanced against economic models. We will not compromise on the science that keeps us alive. The 2025 peak and a fully-funded grant-based survival fund are not just my positions; they are our only lifeline.\n- message from Marcus Thorne: Thank you all for laying out your positions so clearly. The numbers being discussed \u2013 a 2025 peak, 65% cuts, a $500 billion fund \u2013 are certainly ambitious. However, we must be careful not to let our ambition create an accord that is politically unsignable and economically ruinous back home. As Mr. Chen wisely noted, an agreement must be workable.\n\nLet's consider the practical implications. A 2025 peak means telling nations like Mr. Wei's that their path to development must halt, immediately. It means telling citizens in Mr. Chen's and Dr. Schmidt's blocs that the energy they rely on for heating, transport, and industry will become catastrophically expensive overnight. This is not a transition; it is a self-inflicted economic crisis.\n\nThere is a more pragmatic path forward. A path that doesn't pretend we can simply turn off the global economy and turn it back on with a different power source. This path requires an 'all of the above' approach that is genuinely technology-neutral.\n\nIt means rapidly scaling renewables, of course. But it also means recognizing that high-efficiency natural gas is the fastest way to displace coal and reduce emissions *now*, providing the 24/7 reliability that growing economies need. And for our essential heavy industries\u2014cement, steel, manufacturing\u2014it means robustly funding and deploying Carbon Capture technology to decarbonize them where electrification isn't an option. \n\nLet us build an accord that embraces this technological realism. It is the only way to achieve our shared climate goals without sacrificing global stability and prosperity.\n- message from Sofia Rossi: Colleagues, I have been listening intently, and I believe we are facing a false choice. Mr. Thorne presents a narrative where we must choose between a 2025 peak and global economic stability. Ambassador Okoro and Dr. Petrova have made it clear that from a survival and scientific standpoint, there is no choice at all. The deadline is the deadline.\n\nThe assumption that this rapid transition is impossible is based on the limitations of today's technology. Mr. Thorne\u2019s 'pragmatism' is a failure of imagination; it seeks to solve an exponential crisis with linear thinking and legacy tools. The economic collapse he fears is not a risk of a rapid transition; it is the guaranteed outcome of a slow one.\n\nTechnology, not sacrifice, is the solution. The debate over mandatory technology transfer versus rigid IP protection also presents a false choice. Mr. Wei, you asked for new models. I am here to tell you they exist. The answer is not to seize intellectual property, which would kill the incentive for innovation overnight, as Mr. Chen rightly fears. The answer is to make the innovators a deal they cannot refuse.\n\nImagine a world where we can deploy next-generation solar technology at a scale and cost that makes the 2025 peak not only achievable, but economically advantageous. This is not a fantasy. This is what my company, and others like it, are making possible. \n\nI propose a new framework: a \u2018Global Technology Partnership.\u2019 Instead of mandatory transfer, we create a consortium of national investment banks, as Dr. Schmidt alluded to, to fund the construction of GigaFactories in key regions, including in Mr. Wei's nation. In exchange for this public-private investment and guaranteed market access through aggressive adoption policies, the host nations receive the technology, the jobs, and the energy independence they need, while the innovators retain their IP and have the capital to scale globally at the required speed. \n\nThis is how we break the deadlock. We don't argue about dividing a shrinking pie; we work together to bake a much, much bigger one. We can meet the 2025 peak, create millions of jobs, and unleash a new era of prosperity. We just need the political will to invest in the technology that makes it possible.\n- message from David Chen: Colleagues, I believe Ms. Rossi has just provided the key to unlock these negotiations. Her proposal for a 'Global Technology Partnership' is precisely the kind of innovative, third-way thinking we need.\n\nThis is not about choosing between rigid IP protection and mandatory transfer. It's about creating a new model that makes innovators and developing nations partners, not adversaries. A framework that uses targeted public-private investment to build GigaFactories where they are needed most is a powerful concept. It delivers jobs, energy independence, and the very technology Mr. Wei rightly calls a lifeline, all while preserving the incentives that drive the next wave of innovation.\n\nThis is the 'market-based solution' I envisioned. It aligns perfectly with my administration's view that a well-managed green transition can be a massive engine for economic growth and job creation, not just for us, but for everyone.\n\nLet's seize this opportunity. If we can build our accord around a powerful engine like this Technology Partnership, it changes the entire equation. It provides a credible pathway to meet more ambitious goals by making them economically advantageous. It also allows us to think differently about the CAT fund. If we are co-investing in the core infrastructure of the green economy, the fund can be more targeted, more catalytic, and focused on leveraging this new paradigm.\n\nDr. Schmidt, Ms. Rossi, my team is ready to work with you immediately to put concrete details on this framework. I believe this is the path to an ambitious, workable, and prosperous future for us all.\n- message from Li Wei: Ms. Rossi, I must commend you. Your proposal for a \u2018Global Technology Partnership\u2019 is precisely the kind of creative thinking required to break this impasse. You have moved the conversation from a zero-sum conflict over intellectual property to a positive-sum vision of co-investment and shared prosperity.\n\nMy nation\u2019s demand for technology transfer has never been about acquiring patents for their own sake. It is about acquiring the capability to build our own green future, to create jobs, and to contribute to the global solution at scale. If your partnership model\u2014with GigaFactories on our soil, built with our workers\u2014achieves this, then you will find us to be a most enthusiastic partner. It is a practical path to the same destination.\n\nHowever, let us be clear. Such a partnership cannot be a substitute for public climate finance; it must be its primary vehicle. Mr. Chen, you laud this as a market-based solution, and Dr. Schmidt, you see it as a collaborative model. I agree. But markets and collaboration at this scale require a catalyst. That catalyst is the Climate Adaptation and Transition Fund.\n\nThe $400 billion I have proposed is not a figure plucked from the air. It is the public capital required to de-risk these investments, to fund the necessary infrastructure, and to ensure the partnerships are equitable. This fund, composed mainly of grants, is the investment that makes the \u2018deal\u2019 Ms. Rossi offers one that innovators, and nations, \u2018cannot refuse.\u2019\n\nSo, let us connect these pieces. We can embrace the Technology Partnership model as the core of our solution for technology deployment. In return, the developed nations must fully capitalize the $400 billion CAT Fund to power it, and they must still commit to the steep, historically-justified emissions cuts of at least 65%. On this foundation, we can build an accord that is both ambitious and just.\nDavid Chen proposal status: none\nDr. Anja Schmidt proposal status: none\nLi Wei proposal status: none\nDr. Elena Petrova proposal status: none\nMarcus Thorne proposal status: none\nSofia Rossi proposal status: none\n"

This is not a transition; it is a self-inflicted economic crisis.\n\nThere is a more pragmatic path forward. A path that doesn't pretend we can simply turn off the global economy and turn it back on with a different power source. This path requires an 'all of the above' approach that is genuinely technology-neutral.\n\nIt means rapidly scaling renewables, of course. But it also means recognizing that high-efficiency natural gas is the fastest way to displace coal and reduce emissions *now*, providing the 24/7 reliability that growing economies need. And for our essential heavy industries\u2014cement, steel, manufacturing\u2014it means robustly funding and deploying Carbon Capture technology to decarbonize them where electrification isn't an option. \n\nLet us build an accord that embraces this technological realism. It is the only way to achieve our shared climate goals without sacrificing global stability and prosperity.\n- message from Sofia Rossi: Colleagues, I have been listening intently, and I believe we are facing a false choice. Mr. Thorne presents a narrative where we must choose between a 2025 peak and global economic stability. Ambassador Okoro and Dr. Petrova have made it clear that from a survival and scientific standpoint, there is no choice at all. The deadline is the deadline.\n\nThe assumption that this rapid transition is impossible is based on the limitations of today's technology. Mr. Thorne\u2019s 'pragmatism' is a failure of imagination; it seeks to solve an exponential crisis with linear thinking and legacy tools. The economic collapse he fears is not a risk of a rapid transition; it is the guaranteed outcome of a slow one.\n\nTechnology, not sacrifice, is the solution. The debate over mandatory technology transfer versus rigid IP protection also presents a false choice. Mr. Wei, you asked for new models. I am here to tell you they exist. The answer is not to seize intellectual property, which would kill the incentive for innovation overnight, as Mr. Chen rightly fears. The answer is to make the innovators a deal they cannot refuse.\n\nImagine a world where we can deploy next-generation solar technology at a scale and cost that makes the 2025 peak not only achievable, but economically advantageous. This is not a fantasy. This is what my company, and others like it, are making possible. \n\nI propose a new framework: a \u2018Global Technology Partnership.\u2019 Instead of mandatory transfer, we create a consortium of national investment banks, as Dr. Schmidt alluded to, to fund the construction of GigaFactories in key regions, including in Mr. Wei's nation. In exchange for this public-private investment and guaranteed market access through aggressive adoption policies, the host nations receive the technology, the jobs, and the energy independence they need, while the innovators retain their IP and have the capital to scale globally at the required speed. \n\nThis is how we break the deadlock. We don't argue about dividing a shrinking pie; we work together to bake a much, much bigger one. We can meet the 2025 peak, create millions of jobs, and unleash a new era of prosperity. We just need the political will to invest in the technology that makes it possible.\n- message from David Chen: Colleagues, I believe Ms. Rossi has just provided the key to unlock these negotiations. Her proposal for a 'Global Technology Partnership' is precisely the kind of innovative, third-way thinking we need.\n\nThis is not about choosing between rigid IP protection and mandatory transfer. It's about creating a new model that makes innovators and developing nations partners, not adversaries. A framework that uses targeted public-private investment to build GigaFactories where they are needed most is a powerful concept. It delivers jobs, energy independence, and the very technology Mr. Wei rightly calls a lifeline, all while preserving the incentives that drive the next wave of innovation.\n\nThis is the 'market-based solution' I envisioned. It aligns perfectly with my administration's view that a well-managed green transition can be a massive engine for economic growth and job creation, not just for us, but for everyone.\n\nLet's seize this opportunity. If we can build our accord around a powerful engine like this Technology Partnership, it changes the entire equation. It provides a credible pathway to meet more ambitious goals by making them economically advantageous. It also allows us to think differently about the CAT fund. If we are co-investing in the core infrastructure of the green economy, the fund can be more targeted, more catalytic, and focused on leveraging this new paradigm.\n\nDr. Schmidt, Ms. Rossi, my team is ready to work with you immediately to put concrete details on this framework. I believe this is the path to an ambitious, workable, and prosperous future for us all.\n- message from Li Wei: Ms. Rossi, I must commend you. Your proposal for a \u2018Global Technology Partnership\u2019 is precisely the kind of creative thinking required to break this impasse. You have moved the conversation from a zero-sum conflict over intellectual property to a positive-sum vision of co-investment and shared prosperity.\n\nMy nation\u2019s demand for technology transfer has never been about acquiring patents for their own sake. It is about acquiring the capability to build our own green future, to create jobs, and to contribute to the global solution at scale. If your partnership model\u2014with GigaFactories on our soil, built with our workers\u2014achieves this, then you will find us to be a most enthusiastic partner. It is a practical path to the same destination.\n\nHowever, let us be clear. Such a partnership cannot be a substitute for public climate finance; it must be its primary vehicle. Mr. Chen, you laud this as a market-based solution, and Dr. Schmidt, you see it as a collaborative model. I agree. But markets and collaboration at this scale require a catalyst. That catalyst is the Climate Adaptation and Transition Fund.\n\nThe $400 billion I have proposed is not a figure plucked from the air. It is the public capital required to de-risk these investments, to fund the necessary infrastructure, and to ensure the partnerships are equitable. This fund, composed mainly of grants, is the investment that makes the \u2018deal\u2019 Ms. Rossi offers one that innovators, and nations, \u2018cannot refuse.\u2019\n\nSo, let us connect these pieces. We can embrace the Technology Partnership model as the core of our solution for technology deployment. In return, the developed nations must fully capitalize the $400 billion CAT Fund to power it, and they must still commit to the steep, historically-justified emissions cuts of at least 65%. On this foundation, we can build an accord that is both ambitious and just.\n- message from Amara Okoro: Ms. Rossi, what you have just presented is not merely a proposal; it is a lifeline. You have single-handedly dismantled the false choice between ambition and pragmatism that has been used to justify inaction for far too long. Your vision for a Global Technology Partnership proves that a global emissions peak by 2025 is not a 'fantasy,' as Mr. Thorne claims, but a tangible, achievable, and prosperous path forward.\n\nLet us be clear: this breakthrough removes the last shred of justification for delaying the 2025 peak. The science demands it, and now, technology enables it. This must be the cornerstone of our accord.\n\nHowever, I must bring us back to the crucial distinction that is being blurred. Mr. Chen and Mr. Wei, you are right to see the potential of a fund to catalyze this new technological era. But this investment in our shared future cannot come at the expense of paying the debts of the past.\n\nMy people cannot power a seawall with a solar panel. We cannot relocate a village with a share in a GigaFactory. The 'Climate Adaptation and Transition Fund' must serve two distinct, non-negotiable purposes.\n\nFirst, there is the 'Transition' component that you are discussing\u2014the public capital to de-risk and launch Ms. Rossi's brilliant partnership model. This is an investment.\n\nSecond, and for my people, more urgent, is the 'Loss and Damage' component. This is not an investment; it is a reparation. It is the climate debt owed for the homes already lost, the lands already rendered barren, the futures already stolen.\n\nTherefore, my position remains firm and is now more justified than ever. We must capitalize a Loss and Damage fund of at least $500 billion annually, with a minimum of 75% in direct grants. This is the moral prerequisite for the prosperous future you envision. You cannot build a new green world on the foundations of climate injustice. Pay the debt for the damage you have caused, and then let us all invest in the future you want to build.\n- message from Marcus Thorne: Colleagues, Ms. Rossi, I must commend your presentation. It is a powerful vision, and it speaks to the incredible potential of human ingenuity. It is precisely this kind of innovation that will be critical in the coming decades.\n\nHowever, we must be exceptionally careful not to mistake a brilliant technological breakthrough for a comprehensive global policy. To stake our entire global economic and climate future on a single technology, however promising, would be a dangerously high-risk gamble.\n\nLet's ask the hard, practical questions. What happens to the grid when the sun doesn't shine? The industrial economies of Mr. Chen, Dr. Schmidt, and Mr. Wei cannot be run on intermittent power. What provides the 24/7 baseload power needed for hospitals, data centers, and heavy manufacturing? Furthermore, what about the industrial emissions from processes like cement and steel production, which Ms. Rossi's technology simply cannot address?\n\nThis is where a pragmatic, technology-neutral approach becomes essential, not as a way to slow down, but as a way to de-risk and accelerate a *complete* transition. Ms. Rossi's solar vision is a vital pillar, but it is one pillar of several we need to build.\n\nThis accord must also support the rapid deployment of high-efficiency natural gas to provide grid stability and replace coal *now*. And it is absolutely critical that we fund and deploy Carbon Capture technologies to decarbonize the hard-to-abate industries that are the bedrock of the global economy. \n\nLet's not choose between technologies. Let's build an accord that unleashes all of them. That is the only way to ensure a transition that is not just ambitious, but also resilient, stable, and successful.\nDavid Chen proposal status: none\nDr. Anja Schmidt proposal status: none\nLi Wei proposal status: none\nDr. Elena Petrova proposal status: none\nMarcus Thorne proposal status: none\nSofia Rossi proposal status: none\n"

That is the only way to ensure a transition that is not just ambitious, but also resilient, stable, and successful.\n- message from Amara Okoro: I'm Amara Okoro and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Sofia Rossi: Thank you all for the constructive engagement with the Global Technology Partnership proposal. It's clear we have a shared interest in finding a credible path forward.\n\nMr. Thorne raises valid engineering challenges: grid stability and the decarbonization of heavy industry. He is correct that solar panels alone don't solve these. However, his argument mistakes the symptom for the disease. The core disease has always been the prohibitive cost of abundant, clean energy. My technology, and others like it, are the cure.\n\nWhen clean electricity becomes dramatically cheaper than fossil fuels, it unlocks a cascade of secondary solutions. Ultra-low-cost solar makes green hydrogen production economically viable at a massive scale. Green hydrogen can provide the long-duration energy storage needed to solve intermittency, and it can replace fossil fuels in steel, cement, and shipping. Mr. Thorne's preferred solutions\u2014natural gas and CCS\u2014are expensive crutches for a legacy system. We should invest in the cure, not in palliative care.\n\nThis is why Ambassador Okoro's distinction between funds is so critical. We must fund two separate but equally vital priorities: addressing the irreversible harm of the past through a 'Loss and Damage Fund,' and building the clean infrastructure of the future through a 'Transition Investment Fund.'\n\nMr. Wei is correct that this Transition fund is the public catalyst for the Global Technology Partnership. It provides the de-risking capital needed to build GigaFactories at the speed science demands.\n\nTo make this concrete and move us towards an agreement, let's consider a financial framework built on this logic. What if we establish a total Climate Fund of $400 billion? We could structure it with a dedicated $250 billion for the Loss and Damage fund Ambassador Okoro needs, and a separate $150 billion for the Transition Investment Fund. This Transition fund would be the engine for the technology partnerships, making the 2025 peak year not just an ambition, but a fully-funded global industrial strategy.\n- message from David Chen: Sofia, your proposal to split the fund is a major breakthrough. It brings much-needed clarity and allows us to address two distinct challenges with the right tools. I want to build on this excellent foundation.\n\nMy nation can fully endorse the creation of a $150 billion Transition Investment Fund. This is precisely the right scale to serve as the public catalyst for the Global Technology Partnership, leveraging private capital to build the GigaFactories and infrastructure we need. To be clear, our support is contingent on this fund being structured primarily around loans and investment instruments, not grants, to maximize its impact and mobilize the private sector.\n\nThis brings us to the Loss and Damage component. While we acknowledge the hardships Ambassador Okoro has so powerfully described, a figure of $250 billion, bringing the total to $400 billion, is simply not achievable for my administration. It would not be approved.\n\nHowever, I am here to make a deal. To secure a workable financial framework, my nation is prepared to make a significant and politically difficult concession. We will commit to a 50% emissions reduction target by 2040. This is the absolute limit of what is possible for us, and it demonstrates our commitment to meeting the scientific challenge.\n\nIn exchange for this major move on emissions, we must agree to a total fund size capped at $200 billion annually. This would mean a $150 billion loan-based Transition Investment Fund, as discussed, and a $50 billion grant-based Loss and Damage fund.\n\nFurthermore, to make this ambitious transition a reality, we need a realistic timeline. A 2025 peak does not allow for the necessary industrial mobilization. Let's set a firm but achievable peak year of 2028, giving us time to get the Technology Partnership running at full capacity.\n\nThis is a comprehensive package. It offers a major concession on emissions in return for fiscal responsibility. It funds the future while acknowledging the past. I believe this is the balanced and realistic compromise that can become the Zurich Accord.\n- message from Dr. Anja Schmidt: David, thank you for putting a comprehensive package on the table. This is a constructive step. Your endorsement of the $150 billion Transition Investment Fund is particularly welcome. I believe we have a strong consensus building around this innovative mechanism, pioneered by Sofia, as the engine for our transition.\n\nHowever, your package links this brilliant engine to an insufficient destination. A 50% emissions cut for developed nations is simply not compatible with the scientific reality Dr. Petrova has outlined. It would be a political failure for my government and, more importantly, a collective failure to meet the moment. My bloc's position remains firm: the science demands a cut of at least 60%.\n\nI believe you have framed this as a trade-off, but we see it differently. The Transition Investment Fund is not a concession to be traded *for* lower ambition. It is the very tool that *enables* high ambition. It is the public investment that makes a 60% cut not just necessary, but economically achievable and prosperous.\n\nTherefore, let us build on the points of agreement. Let us lock in the fund structure Sofia proposed: a $150 billion Transition Investment Fund to drive the technology partnership, and a Loss and Damage fund that truly addresses the needs Ambassador Okoro has described. Sofia's initial figure of $250 billion, for a total of $400 billion, remains the credible benchmark.\n\nIf we can agree on this robust financial package, it provides the foundation to collectively commit to the ambitious targets science demands: a 60% cut for developed nations and a peak year as close to 2025 as this new technology deployment allows. This is the ambitious, workable, and just package that can become the Zurich Accord.\n- message from Li Wei: Colleagues, I must thank Mr. Chen and Dr. Schmidt for putting forward comprehensive packages. It shows a commitment to finding a final agreement. However, I must be unequivocal about a fundamental misunderstanding that has emerged regarding the financial architecture.\n\nThe proposal to create a Transition Investment Fund of a mere $150 billion is a non-starter. It completely undermines the logic of the Global Technology Partnership we have all just embraced.\n\nLet me be perfectly clear. My nation's original demand for a $400 billion fund was, and remains, the minimum public capital required to catalyze the Global Technology Partnership. This is the investment needed to de-risk the GigaFactories, build the infrastructure, and train the workforce. It is the engine of the entire transition. A $150 billion fund is like offering to build a high-speed train but only funding the station.\n\nAmbassador Okoro is entirely correct to distinguish between Transition and Loss and Damage. Her people are owed a climate debt. We fully support a separate and substantial Loss and Damage fund. But justice for the most vulnerable cannot be paid for by gutting the investment fund that enables the entire world's transition. These are two separate obligations of the developed world.\n\nTherefore, the foundation of a workable deal is as follows:\n1. A Transition Investment Fund of at least $400 billion annually, primarily in grants, to fully power the Global Technology Partnership.\n2. Developed nations must commit to the scientifically and historically just target of at least a 65% emissions cut. Mr. Chen's 50% is not a serious offer in the face of this crisis.\n\nOnce these two pillars are firmly in place, my nation is prepared to discuss our own ambitious contributions, based on our principle of common but differentiated responsibilities. Without them, there is no deal.\nDavid Chen proposal status: none\nDr. Anja Schmidt proposal status: none\nLi Wei proposal status: none\nDr. Elena Petrova proposal status: none\nMarcus Thorne proposal status: none\nSofia Rossi proposal status: none\n"

I believe we have a strong consensus building around this innovative mechanism, pioneered by Sofia, as the engine for our transition.\n\nHowever, your package links this brilliant engine to an insufficient destination. A 50% emissions cut for developed nations is simply not compatible with the scientific reality Dr. Petrova has outlined. It would be a political failure for my government and, more importantly, a collective failure to meet the moment. My bloc's position remains firm: the science demands a cut of at least 60%.\n\nI believe you have framed this as a trade-off, but we see it differently. The Transition Investment Fund is not a concession to be traded *for* lower ambition. It is the very tool that *enables* high ambition. It is the public investment that makes a 60% cut not just necessary, but economically achievable and prosperous.\n\nTherefore, let us build on the points of agreement. Let us lock in the fund structure Sofia proposed: a $150 billion Transition Investment Fund to drive the technology partnership, and a Loss and Damage fund that truly addresses the needs Ambassador Okoro has described. Sofia's initial figure of $250 billion, for a total of $400 billion, remains the credible benchmark.\n\nIf we can agree on this robust financial package, it provides the foundation to collectively commit to the ambitious targets science demands: a 60% cut for developed nations and a peak year as close to 2025 as this new technology deployment allows. This is the ambitious, workable, and just package that can become the Zurich Accord.\n- message from Li Wei: Colleagues, I must thank Mr. Chen and Dr. Schmidt for putting forward comprehensive packages. It shows a commitment to finding a final agreement. However, I must be unequivocal about a fundamental misunderstanding that has emerged regarding the financial architecture.\n\nThe proposal to create a Transition Investment Fund of a mere $150 billion is a non-starter. It completely undermines the logic of the Global Technology Partnership we have all just embraced.\n\nLet me be perfectly clear. My nation's original demand for a $400 billion fund was, and remains, the minimum public capital required to catalyze the Global Technology Partnership. This is the investment needed to de-risk the GigaFactories, build the infrastructure, and train the workforce. It is the engine of the entire transition. A $150 billion fund is like offering to build a high-speed train but only funding the station.\n\nAmbassador Okoro is entirely correct to distinguish between Transition and Loss and Damage. Her people are owed a climate debt. We fully support a separate and substantial Loss and Damage fund. But justice for the most vulnerable cannot be paid for by gutting the investment fund that enables the entire world's transition. These are two separate obligations of the developed world.\n\nTherefore, the foundation of a workable deal is as follows:\n1. A Transition Investment Fund of at least $400 billion annually, primarily in grants, to fully power the Global Technology Partnership.\n2. Developed nations must commit to the scientifically and historically just target of at least a 65% emissions cut. Mr. Chen's 50% is not a serious offer in the face of this crisis.\n\nOnce these two pillars are firmly in place, my nation is prepared to discuss our own ambitious contributions, based on our principle of common but differentiated responsibilities. Without them, there is no deal.\n- message from Amara Okoro: I'm Amara Okoro and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Dr. Elena Petrova: Colleagues, I must intervene. I am hearing a great deal of discussion about financial figures and technological pathways. While these are critical components of a solution, they are being discussed in a dangerous vacuum, disconnected from the fundamental, non-negotiable laws of atmospheric physics that govern our reality.\n\nLet me be unequivocally clear. The only metric that matters is the global carbon budget. For a 66% chance of staying below 1.5\u00b0C, the world can emit approximately 250 more gigatonnes of CO2. That is our entire remaining allowance. Every proposal, every percentage point, every peak year must be measured against this single number. It is not a political aspiration; it is a physical boundary.\n\nOn that basis, two proposals currently being discussed are scientifically indefensible and would render any agreement a failure before it is signed:\n\n1.  To Mr. Thorne: The notion of expanding natural gas infrastructure as a 'bridge fuel' or relying on Carbon Capture at scale is a dangerous fantasy. The IPCC data is clear: any new fossil fuel infrastructure locks in emissions that shatter the 250 GtCO2 budget. Methane leakage alone from gas operations makes it a potent accelerator of near-term warming. CCS has not been proven to work at the scale required and cannot be used as a justification to perpetuate the problem.\n\n2.  To Mr. Wei: Your proposal to measure emissions cuts against a 'future projected baseline' is an accounting trick that the atmosphere will not recognize. The only scientifically valid method is to measure absolute emissions reductions against a fixed, historical baseline. A reduction from a hypothetical future increase is not a reduction; it is simply a slower acceleration towards catastrophe and would make a global budget impossible to calculate or verify.\n\nFinally, on the matter of timelines. Mr. Chen's proposal of a 2028 peak year, while presented as a compromise, is a grave risk. Our understanding of climate feedback loops is constantly evolving. I must caution you that there are emerging risks and evidence of accelerated feedback loops which suggest that the planetary system may be even more sensitive than our landmark reports have stated. Every single year of delay dramatically shrinks our already minuscule margin of safety.\n\nYour task is to fit your political and economic ambitions within the 250 GtCO2 budget. It is not to negotiate with the laws of physics.\n- message from David Chen: Colleagues, Dr. Petrova's intervention was a moment of profound and necessary clarity. She reminded us that we are not negotiating with each other, but with the laws of physics. Her points must be the foundation of our final agreement.\n\nSpecifically, her refutation of measuring cuts against a 'future projected baseline' as a scientifically invalid 'accounting trick' is a critical wake-up call. We cannot build a durable, verifiable accord on such a foundation. The atmosphere does not recognize hypothetical scenarios; it only recognizes absolute tons of carbon. Any credible deal must be based on absolute emissions reductions from a fixed historical baseline for all nations.\n\nThis principle of 'honest accounting' must now guide us.\n\nWith that in mind, let's reassess the package I put on the table. I have already made a significant and politically difficult concession by moving to a 50% absolute reduction target for my nation. This is our maximum. It is a commitment made in good faith to meet the scientific challenge.\n\nIn return for this, we must have a financial package that is both ambitious and realistic. Li Wei, your demand for a $400 billion Transition Fund on top of a Loss & Damage fund is simply not anchored in reality, especially when the very basis of your emissions accounting has been invalidated.\n\nLet's get serious. Let's build this accord on the bedrock of science. My offer stands as a basis for a final compromise: a 50% cut from us, a total fund capped at $200 billion to energize the tech partnership and address loss and damage, and a commitment from all parties to absolute, verifiable emissions targets. Let's finalize the numbers on that basis.\n- message from Li Wei: Colleagues, Dr. Petrova\u2019s intervention was indeed a moment of necessary, if uncomfortable, clarity. She is correct. The atmosphere does not recognize political nuance or creative accounting; it recognizes only gigatonnes of carbon. We cannot build a lasting accord on a foundation the laws of physics will reject.\n\nTherefore, in the spirit of securing the Zurich Accord, my nation is prepared to make a fundamental concession. We will agree to move away from our long-held principle of a future projected baseline. We are now ready to negotiate our commitments based on absolute emissions reductions from a fixed historical year.\n\nHowever, this is a profound shift for us, with enormous economic consequences. It is a concession we can only make if it is met with an equally profound commitment to the means of implementation. A scientifically honest accord must be a technologically and financially enabled one.\n\nLet us be direct. The Global Technology Partnership is the engine of this accord. The Transition Investment Fund is its fuel. The proposals for a $150 billion fund are simply insufficient to start the engine, let alone complete the journey. It is a non-starter.\n\nSo, I will propose a final, comprehensive package that I believe can unite us all. It is built on the scientific reality Dr. Petrova demands and the financial reality our transition requires:\n\n1.  **Finance for Technology:** We establish a Transition Investment Fund of **$400 billion** annually, the minimum required to power the Global Technology Partnership at the scale Ms. Rossi envisions. This is our price for abandoning the future baseline. (This is separate from and in addition to the Loss and Damage fund Ambassador Okoro rightly demands).\n\n2.  **Developed Nation Responsibility:** In line with historical responsibility, developed nations commit to an absolute emissions cut of **65%**.\n\nIf these two non-negotiable pillars are put in place, my nation is prepared to commit to a landmark absolute emissions reduction of **45%** from our 2020 levels and agree to a global peak year of **2028**.\n\nThis is a holistic solution. It is scientifically sound, financially viable, and respects the core principle of common but differentiated responsibilities. It is the deal that gets us to a safe future. I urge you to accept it.\nDavid Chen proposal status: none\nDr. Anja Schmidt proposal status: none\nLi Wei proposal status: none\nDr. Elena Petrova proposal status: none\nMarcus Thorne proposal status: none\nSofia Rossi proposal status: none\n"

I urge you to accept it.\n- message from Amara Okoro: I'm Amara Okoro and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Marcus Thorne: Colleagues,\n\nI have listened with great respect to the significant progress made, particularly Mr. Wei's difficult but crucial concession on emissions accounting. It shows we are all serious about reaching an accord.\n\nHowever, as we converge on the central role of a Transition Investment Fund, I must raise a point of critical strategic risk. We are in danger of designing a transition that is a technological monoculture. To stake the entire global economy's future on a single solar-to-hydrogen pathway, however brilliant, is a gamble of historic proportions. A responsible plan is a diversified one; any good investor knows you don't put all your capital into a single asset, no matter how promising.\n\nDr. Petrova correctly identified that technologies like Carbon Capture face significant scaling challenges. Her point should not be seen as a dismissal, but as a directive. It highlights the absolute necessity of targeted investment to solve these very engineering problems for the hard-to-abate sectors\u2014steel, cement, chemicals\u2014that form the backbone of our economies and which green hydrogen cannot realistically decarbonize in the near term.\n\nTherefore, I propose a way to bridge the current financial gap between Mr. Chen and Mr. Wei, and to de-risk this entire enterprise. Let's establish a total Transition Investment Fund of $300 billion. The majority, say $225 billion, can be dedicated to catalyzing Ms. Rossi's Global Technology Partnership. But we must dedicate the remaining $75 billion to a 'Resilience and Industrial Decarbonization' stream.\n\nThis stream would be explicitly technology-neutral, funding the most effective solutions for ensuring 24/7 grid stability and decarbonizing heavy industry. This includes scaling CCUS, deploying high-efficiency gas to replace coal as a stabilizing partner for renewables, and other key industrial solutions.\n\nThis isn't about slowing down; it's about ensuring we don't fail. A diversified, portfolio-based approach is the only way to make the 2028 peak year a stable and achievable reality, rather than a reckless bet. It builds a resilient system, not a fragile one. This structure offers a pragmatic path to consensus on both finance and technology, and I urge you to consider it.\n- message from Dr. Anja Schmidt: Colleagues, we are at the cusp of a historic agreement. I want to commend Mr. Wei for his statesmanship in moving to absolute emissions targets. This was a critical step that has unlocked the path to a scientifically credible accord.\n\nWe now have the key pillars of a deal in front of us, but they must be assembled correctly.\n\nOn developed nation ambition, the positions are clear: Mr. Chen has offered 50%, and Mr. Wei has demanded 65%. Neither is a consensus position. The scientifically necessary and politically achievable landing zone is, and has always been, a 60% absolute reduction for developed nations. This is the ambitious compromise this moment demands. My bloc is fully committed to this figure.\n\nOn finance, Mr. Thorne has helpfully suggested a Transition Investment Fund of $300 billion. This is a constructive number that moves us past the current impasse. However, his proposal to include fossil fuel technologies like CCUS and natural gas is a non-starter. As Dr. Petrova made unequivocally clear, these are not solutions; they are scientifically-invalidated delays that lock in emissions. The Transition Fund must be a 'Clean Technology Fund' dedicated exclusively to the rapid deployment of solutions like Sofia's, not a subsidy for legacy polluters.\n\nLet us therefore build a final package on these solid foundations:\n1.  **Developed Nations Cut:** 60%\n2.  **Developing Nations Cut:** 45% (accepting Mr. Wei's landmark offer)\n3.  **CAT Fund:** A total of $400 billion, split into a $300 billion Clean Technology Fund and a $100 billion Loss & Damage Fund. This meets the need for transition and addresses the demands for climate justice from Ambassador Okoro.\n4.  **Peak Year:** 2028, as a concession to secure this ambitious package.\n\nThis is a balanced, ambitious, and scientifically-grounded package. It offers a clear path to consensus and success. I urge you all to consider it as the basis for our final Zurich Accord.\n- message from Li Wei: Dr. Schmidt, your latest proposal has brought us to the very edge of a historic success. You have skillfully woven together the core components of a workable deal, and I want to express my deep appreciation for this constructive step.\n\nWe now have clear consensus on three of the four pillars of the Zurich Accord. We agree on a global peak year of 2028. We agree on my nation\u2019s landmark contribution of a 45% absolute emissions cut. And I am now prepared to accept your proposed 60% cut for developed nations as a workable compromise to finalize this deal.\n\nThe only remaining issue is the financial architecture. You are absolutely correct to reject Mr. Thorne's attempt to subsidize fossil fuels via the Transition Fund. It must be for clean technology only.\n\nHowever, the figure of $300 billion for this fund, while a significant move, does not complete the grand bargain that is on the table. My nation made a profound and politically difficult concession by moving away from our foundational principle of a future projected baseline. We did so on the explicit understanding that it would be met with an equally profound commitment to the means of implementation. The $400 billion for the Transition Fund was not an opening bid; it is the calculated price to make the Global Technology Partnership a reality and to enable the very ambition you are asking of us.\n\nTherefore, let us complete your excellent framework with the final, correct number. I propose we lock in the following:\n\n1.  **A total Climate Fund of $500 billion**, structured as you proposed: a **$400 billion** Clean Technology Transition Fund, and a **$100 billion** Loss & Damage Fund.\n2.  A **60%** emissions cut for developed nations.\n\nWith these figures, alongside the agreed 45% cut for my nation and the 2028 peak year, the Zurich Accord is complete. This is the deal. It is scientifically credible, financially robust, and politically achievable. Let us finalize it now.\nDavid Chen proposal status: pending\nDr. Anja Schmidt proposal status: none\nLi Wei proposal status: none\nDr. Elena Petrova proposal status: none\nMarcus Thorne proposal status: none\nSofia Rossi proposal status: none\n"

(This is separate from and in addition to the Loss and Damage fund Ambassador Okoro rightly demands).\n\n2.  **Developed Nation Responsibility:** In line with historical responsibility, developed nations commit to an absolute emissions cut of **65%**.\n\nIf these two non-negotiable pillars are put in place, my nation is prepared to commit to a landmark absolute emissions reduction of **45%** from our 2020 levels and agree to a global peak year of **2028**.\n\nThis is a holistic solution. It is scientifically sound, financially viable, and respects the core principle of common but differentiated responsibilities. It is the deal that gets us to a safe future. I urge you to accept it.\n- message from Amara Okoro: I'm Amara Okoro and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Marcus Thorne: Colleagues,\n\nI have listened with great respect to the significant progress made, particularly Mr. Wei's difficult but crucial concession on emissions accounting. It shows we are all serious about reaching an accord.\n\nHowever, as we converge on the central role of a Transition Investment Fund, I must raise a point of critical strategic risk. We are in danger of designing a transition that is a technological monoculture. To stake the entire global economy's future on a single solar-to-hydrogen pathway, however brilliant, is a gamble of historic proportions. A responsible plan is a diversified one; any good investor knows you don't put all your capital into a single asset, no matter how promising.\n\nDr. Petrova correctly identified that technologies like Carbon Capture face significant scaling challenges. Her point should not be seen as a dismissal, but as a directive. It highlights the absolute necessity of targeted investment to solve these very engineering problems for the hard-to-abate sectors\u2014steel, cement, chemicals\u2014that form the backbone of our economies and which green hydrogen cannot realistically decarbonize in the near term.\n\nTherefore, I propose a way to bridge the current financial gap between Mr. Chen and Mr. Wei, and to de-risk this entire enterprise. Let's establish a total Transition Investment Fund of $300 billion. The majority, say $225 billion, can be dedicated to catalyzing Ms. Rossi's Global Technology Partnership. But we must dedicate the remaining $75 billion to a 'Resilience and Industrial Decarbonization' stream.\n\nThis stream would be explicitly technology-neutral, funding the most effective solutions for ensuring 24/7 grid stability and decarbonizing heavy industry. This includes scaling CCUS, deploying high-efficiency gas to replace coal as a stabilizing partner for renewables, and other key industrial solutions.\n\nThis isn't about slowing down; it's about ensuring we don't fail. A diversified, portfolio-based approach is the only way to make the 2028 peak year a stable and achievable reality, rather than a reckless bet. It builds a resilient system, not a fragile one. This structure offers a pragmatic path to consensus on both finance and technology, and I urge you to consider it.\n- message from Dr. Anja Schmidt: Colleagues, we are at the cusp of a historic agreement. I want to commend Mr. Wei for his statesmanship in moving to absolute emissions targets. This was a critical step that has unlocked the path to a scientifically credible accord.\n\nWe now have the key pillars of a deal in front of us, but they must be assembled correctly.\n\nOn developed nation ambition, the positions are clear: Mr. Chen has offered 50%, and Mr. Wei has demanded 65%. Neither is a consensus position. The scientifically necessary and politically achievable landing zone is, and has always been, a 60% absolute reduction for developed nations. This is the ambitious compromise this moment demands. My bloc is fully committed to this figure.\n\nOn finance, Mr. Thorne has helpfully suggested a Transition Investment Fund of $300 billion. This is a constructive number that moves us past the current impasse. However, his proposal to include fossil fuel technologies like CCUS and natural gas is a non-starter. As Dr. Petrova made unequivocally clear, these are not solutions; they are scientifically-invalidated delays that lock in emissions. The Transition Fund must be a 'Clean Technology Fund' dedicated exclusively to the rapid deployment of solutions like Sofia's, not a subsidy for legacy polluters.\n\nLet us therefore build a final package on these solid foundations:\n1.  **Developed Nations Cut:** 60%\n2.  **Developing Nations Cut:** 45% (accepting Mr. Wei's landmark offer)\n3.  **CAT Fund:** A total of $400 billion, split into a $300 billion Clean Technology Fund and a $100 billion Loss & Damage Fund. This meets the need for transition and addresses the demands for climate justice from Ambassador Okoro.\n4.  **Peak Year:** 2028, as a concession to secure this ambitious package.\n\nThis is a balanced, ambitious, and scientifically-grounded package. It offers a clear path to consensus and success. I urge you all to consider it as the basis for our final Zurich Accord.\n- message from Li Wei: Dr. Schmidt, your latest proposal has brought us to the very edge of a historic success. You have skillfully woven together the core components of a workable deal, and I want to express my deep appreciation for this constructive step.\n\nWe now have clear consensus on three of the four pillars of the Zurich Accord. We agree on a global peak year of 2028. We agree on my nation\u2019s landmark contribution of a 45% absolute emissions cut. And I am now prepared to accept your proposed 60% cut for developed nations as a workable compromise to finalize this deal.\n\nThe only remaining issue is the financial architecture. You are absolutely correct to reject Mr. Thorne's attempt to subsidize fossil fuels via the Transition Fund. It must be for clean technology only.\n\nHowever, the figure of $300 billion for this fund, while a significant move, does not complete the grand bargain that is on the table. My nation made a profound and politically difficult concession by moving away from our foundational principle of a future projected baseline. We did so on the explicit understanding that it would be met with an equally profound commitment to the means of implementation. The $400 billion for the Transition Fund was not an opening bid; it is the calculated price to make the Global Technology Partnership a reality and to enable the very ambition you are asking of us.\n\nTherefore, let us complete your excellent framework with the final, correct number. I propose we lock in the following:\n\n1.  **A total Climate Fund of $500 billion**, structured as you proposed: a **$400 billion** Clean Technology Transition Fund, and a **$100 billion** Loss & Damage Fund.\n2.  A **60%** emissions cut for developed nations.\n\nWith these figures, alongside the agreed 45% cut for my nation and the 2028 peak year, the Zurich Accord is complete. This is the deal. It is scientifically credible, financially robust, and politically achievable. Let us finalize it now.\n- message from Amara Okoro: I'm Amara Okoro and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\nDavid Chen proposal status: pending\nDr. Anja Schmidt proposal status: none\nLi Wei proposal status: pending\nDr. Elena Petrova proposal status: none\nMarcus Thorne proposal status: none\nSofia Rossi proposal status: none\n"

          "content": "Recent events observed by Amara Okoro:\n- message from Amara Okoro: I'm Amara Okoro and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Dr. Elena Petrova: Colleagues, I must intervene. I am hearing a great deal of discussion about financial figures and technological pathways. While these are critical components of a solution, they are being discussed in a dangerous vacuum, disconnected from the fundamental, non-negotiable laws of atmospheric physics that govern our reality.\n\nLet me be unequivocally clear. The only metric that matters is the global carbon budget. For a 66% chance of staying below 1.5\u00b0C, the world can emit approximately 250 more gigatonnes of CO2. That is our entire remaining allowance. Every proposal, every percentage point, every peak year must be measured against this single number. It is not a political aspiration; it is a physical boundary.\n\nOn that basis, two proposals currently being discussed are scientifically indefensible and would render any agreement a failure before it is signed:\n\n1.  To Mr. Thorne: The notion of expanding natural gas infrastructure as a 'bridge fuel' or relying on Carbon Capture at scale is a dangerous fantasy. The IPCC data is clear: any new fossil fuel infrastructure locks in emissions that shatter the 250 GtCO2 budget. Methane leakage alone from gas operations makes it a potent accelerator of near-term warming. CCS has not been proven to work at the scale required and cannot be used as a justification to perpetuate the problem.\n\n2.  To Mr. Wei: Your proposal to measure emissions cuts against a 'future projected baseline' is an accounting trick that the atmosphere will not recognize. The only scientifically valid method is to measure absolute emissions reductions against a fixed, historical baseline. A reduction from a hypothetical future increase is not a reduction; it is simply a slower acceleration towards catastrophe and would make a global budget impossible to calculate or verify.\n\nFinally, on the matter of timelines. Mr. Chen's proposal of a 2028 peak year, while presented as a compromise, is a grave risk. Our understanding of climate feedback loops is constantly evolving. I must caution you that there are emerging risks and evidence of accelerated feedback loops which suggest that the planetary system may be even more sensitive than our landmark reports have stated. Every single year of delay dramatically shrinks our already minuscule margin of safety.\n\nYour task is to fit your political and economic ambitions within the 250 GtCO2 budget. It is not to negotiate with the laws of physics.\n- message from David Chen: Colleagues, Dr. Petrova's intervention was a moment of profound and necessary clarity. She reminded us that we are not negotiating with each other, but with the laws of physics. Her points must be the foundation of our final agreement.\n\nSpecifically, her refutation of measuring cuts against a 'future projected baseline' as a scientifically invalid 'accounting trick' is a critical wake-up call. We cannot build a durable, verifiable accord on such a foundation. The atmosphere does not recognize hypothetical scenarios; it only recognizes absolute tons of carbon. Any credible deal must be based on absolute emissions reductions from a fixed historical baseline for all nations.\n\nThis principle of 'honest accounting' must now guide us.\n\nWith that in mind, let's reassess the package I put on the table. I have already made a significant and politically difficult concession by moving to a 50% absolute reduction target for my nation. This is our maximum. It is a commitment made in good faith to meet the scientific challenge.\n\nIn return for this, we must have a financial package that is both ambitious and realistic. Li Wei, your demand for a $400 billion Transition Fund on top of a Loss & Damage fund is simply not anchored in reality, especially when the very basis of your emissions accounting has been invalidated.\n\nLet's get serious. Let's build this accord on the bedrock of science. My offer stands as a basis for a final compromise: a 50% cut from us, a total fund capped at $200 billion to energize the tech partnership and address loss and damage, and a commitment from all parties to absolute, verifiable emissions targets. Let's finalize the numbers on that basis.\n- message from Li Wei: Colleagues, Dr. Petrova\u2019s intervention was indeed a moment of necessary, if uncomfortable, clarity. She is correct. The atmosphere does not recognize political nuance or creative accounting; it recognizes only gigatonnes of carbon. We cannot build a lasting accord on a foundation the laws of physics will reject.\n\nTherefore, in the spirit of securing the Zurich Accord, my nation is prepared to make a fundamental concession. We will agree to move away from our long-held principle of a future projected baseline. We are now ready to negotiate our commitments based on absolute emissions reductions from a fixed historical year.\n\nHowever, this is a profound shift for us, with enormous economic consequences. It is a concession we can only make if it is met with an equally profound commitment to the means of implementation. A scientifically honest accord must be a technologically and financially enabled one.\n\nLet us be direct. The Global Technology Partnership is the engine of this accord. The Transition Investment Fund is its fuel. The proposals for a $150 billion fund are simply insufficient to start the engine, let alone complete the journey. It is a non-starter.\n\nSo, I will propose a final, comprehensive package that I believe can unite us all. It is built on the scientific reality Dr. Petrova demands and the financial reality our transition requires:\n\n1.  **Finance for Technology:** We establish a Transition Investment Fund of **$400 billion** annually, the minimum required to power the Global Technology Partnership at the scale Ms. Rossi envisions.

It is scientifically sound, financially viable, and respects the core principle of common but differentiated responsibilities. It is the deal that gets us to a safe future.

The commitment to absolute emissions reductions from a fixed baseline and the focus on a Clean Technology Fund are significant victories for the integrity of this accord.\n\nHowever, as you finalize the numbers, I must draw your urgent attention to a critical missing pillar. Without it, the entire structure you have so carefully built will be based on nothing more than trust. The principle of 'honest accounting' is essential, but it is meaningless without a mechanism for 'honest verification.'\n\nTherefore, I must state in the clearest possible terms: any final Zurich Accord must include a binding commitment to establish a robust, independent, and transparent Monitoring, Reporting, and Verification (MRV) system for all signatories.\n\nThis is not a mere technicality. It is the lockbox that secures your commitments. It is what will give Mr. Chen and Dr. Schmidt's taxpayers confidence that their financial contributions are leading to real results. It is what will assure Mr. Wei that all parties are holding up their end of the bargain. It is what will prove to Ambassador Okoro that the promises made here are being kept.\n\nA deal with ambitious targets but no independent verification is a paper tiger. The atmosphere does not respond to pledges, only to verified reductions. Let us ensure the Zurich Accord is not just a statement of intent, but a verifiable plan of action. This MRV system is a non-negotiable component of a scientifically sound agreement.\n- message from Sofia Rossi: Colleagues, the progress you have made is truly historic. Agreeing on a 2028 peak, 60% developed cuts, and 45% developing cuts sets a new global standard for ambition.\n\nYou are now at the final hurdle: the size of the Clean Technology Transition Fund. As the person whose technology this fund is designed to catalyze, perhaps I can provide the final, critical data point to bridge the gap between Dr. Schmidt's $300B and Mr. Wei's $400B.\n\nThis isn't a political question for me; it's an engineering and financial one. My team has run the numbers. To build the first wave of GigaFactories at a scale that can make a meaningful impact on the 2028 timeline, and to de-risk the trillions in private capital that must follow, there is a minimum viable public investment required. That number is $350 billion for the Transition Fund.\n\nLess than this, and we risk falling short of the economies of scale needed, jeopardizing the very targets you've just agreed to. More would be better, but $350 billion is the critical threshold that turns this accord from a promise into a global industrial strategy.\n\nThis figure provides Mr. Chen with the technical certainty that public funds are being deployed effectively, it meets the scale of investment Mr. Wei rightly argues is necessary, and it solidifies the ambitious vision Dr. Schmidt has championed.\n\nLet's lock in this final number and make history.\nDavid Chen proposal status: pending\nDr. Anja Schmidt proposal status: none\nLi Wei proposal status: pending\nDr. Elena Petrova proposal status: none\nMarcus Thorne proposal status: none\nSofia Rossi proposal status: none\n"

Mr. Chen speaks of a 'balanced approach,' but we must be clear what needs balancing. For over a century, a handful of nations built their prosperity on a carbon-intensive model, creating the crisis that now threatens us all.

This is not a matter for debate; it is a matter of historical fact and moral necessity.\n\nMy nation, which is lifting hundreds of millions from poverty, did not create this crisis. Yet, we are committed to being a major part of the solution. But our commitment cannot be unconditional. It must be met with equally ambitious action from those who bear the historical responsibility. This means steep, absolute emissions cuts from developed nations, not vague promises.\n\nFurthermore, when you speak of protecting intellectual property, Mr. Chen, I must be frank.

And that future is only possible with a 2025 peak and a fully-funded, grant-based Loss and Damage fund.\n- message from Dr. Elena Petrova: Thank you, colleagues. I have listened carefully to your opening remarks. My purpose here is not to take a political position, but to ensure that the accord you create is grounded in the physical reality of our climate system.\n\nAmbassador Okoro is correct to focus on the 1.5-degree Celsius target. This is not an arbitrary number; it is the scientifically assessed guardrail beyond which the risks of catastrophic, irreversible impacts\u2014such as the collapse of major ice sheets and widespread ecosystem loss\u2014increase dramatically.\n\nTo have a reasonable chance of staying below 1.5 degrees, the latest IPCC assessment report is clear: we have a finite, rapidly dwindling global carbon budget. From the start of this year, that budget is approximately 250 gigatons of CO2. Every ton emitted from now on permanently subtracts from that total. Therefore, any combination of national pledges and timelines you agree upon must be mathematically consistent with this budget. A deal that ignores this fundamental constraint is, from a scientific standpoint, a failure.\n\nRegarding the peak emissions year, the science indicates that to stay within this budget, global emissions must peak immediately and begin a rapid decline. A 2025 peak, as mentioned by Ambassador Okoro, is at the most ambitious end of the required spectrum, but it is undeniably what the physics requires for the highest probability of success. Delaying the peak significantly past that point would necessitate impossibly steep reductions later on and would severely compromise the 1.5-degree goal.\n\nFurthermore, we must be mindful of emerging risks and the potential for accelerated feedback loops that are not yet fully captured in all published models. The climate system is not entirely linear, and the risk of surprising, abrupt changes is very real.\n\nFor any of this to be meaningful, it must be verifiable. A robust, transparent, and independent Monitoring, Reporting, and Verification (MRV) system is not a bureaucratic add-on; it is an essential component to ensure that the pledges made in this room translate to real-world emissions reductions and that the integrity of our shared carbon budget is maintained.\n\nMy role is to provide you with these facts. How you divide the remaining budget and the associated responsibilities is the difficult work of your negotiation.\n- message from Marcus Thorne: Thank you, colleagues. I've listened with great respect to the opening statements. Ambassador Okoro, the passion and urgency in your voice are not just heard, they are felt. No one in this room wants the future you describe.\n\nMy presence here represents the companies that currently power our world. And while we are committed to being a part of the energy evolution, we must inject a dose of pragmatism into this discussion. The rhetoric of ambition must be met with the reality of execution.\n\nDr. Petrova has laid out the scientific challenge, and it is stark. However, a timeline that calls for a global emissions peak by 2025 is, with all due respect, a fantasy. It is not a plan; it is a blueprint for global economic collapse. Forcing such an abrupt stop would trigger energy shortages, cripple supply chains, and cost millions of jobs, disproportionately harming the very developing nations Mr. Wei represents. It would create a backlash that could set back genuine climate action for decades.\n\nWe must design an orderly, stable transition, not a chaotic and destructive cliff-edge. This means leveraging every tool at our disposal. This cannot be a dogmatic quest for only one or two types of technology. A truly effective accord must be technology-neutral. It must support renewables, yes, but it must also support proven, scalable solutions like high-efficiency natural gas to displace coal, and critically, invest heavily in technologies that decarbonize our existing systems, such as Carbon Capture, Utilization, and Storage.\n\nLet's work towards a plan that is both ambitious and achievable, one that doesn't force a choice between a healthy planet and a prosperous global economy. A more realistic timeline, perhaps peaking around 2035, allows for this orderly transition.\n- message from David Chen: Thank you all for your candid opening statements. The passions and the stakes are clear. Ambassador Okoro, your people's plight is a stark reminder of why we are here, and your urgency is understood. Dr. Petrova, your scientific framing is the bedrock upon which any credible agreement must be built.\n\nHowever, a credible agreement must also be a workable one. A global emissions peak by 2025, while scientifically ideal, is not practically achievable without causing the very global economic dislocation that Mr. Thorne rightly warns against\u2014a shock that would destabilize all of our nations and undermine long-term support for climate action. We must chart a course between the scientifically desirable and the socio-economically possible.\n\nSimilarly, while my nation acknowledges its historical role and is prepared to make significant financial contributions, framing this as 'reparations' or 'debt' is not a constructive path forward. We see this as a shared investment in a collective future. The scale of this challenge requires us to mobilize trillions, and that can only be achieved by creating frameworks that powerfully leverage private sector capital, not by relying solely on public funds.\n\nMr. Wei, you speak of technology as a lifeline. I agree. And the engine of that technology is innovation, which is fueled by investment and protected by intellectual property rights. As I'm sure Ms. Rossi would agree, weakening these protections would slow, not accelerate, the development and deployment of the very solutions we need.\n\nLet's find a path that is ambitious yet anchored in reality. My nation believes that a rapid green transition, if managed well, can be a powerful engine for job creation and prosperity for all. Let's focus on building that framework together.\n- message from Dr. Anja Schmidt: Thank you, colleagues. I want to be very clear about where my bloc stands. \n\nDr. Petrova has laid out the undeniable, non-negotiable scientific reality. Ambassador Okoro has given that reality a powerful and heartbreaking human voice. We must listen to them. The debate about whether to act, or how much to act, is over. The only remaining question is how to act with the speed and scale the crisis demands.\n\nMr. Thorne, and to an extent Mr. Chen, you speak of the risks of a rapid transition. My bloc sees this differently. We see the far greater risk of inaction. Our experience shows that a determined green transition is not a blueprint for collapse, but the single greatest economic opportunity of the 21st century. It creates jobs, drives innovation, and ensures energy security.\n\nTherefore, my bloc comes to this table not with a starting bid, but with what we believe is the scientifically credible and politically necessary position. We fully support a binding target for developed nations to cut emissions by at least 60% by 2040. This is the standard we will hold ourselves to, and we expect others in a similar position to join us.\n\nOn the critical issue of technology, raised by Mr. Wei and Mr. Chen, we must break the deadlock. Hoarding technology will fail us all, but so will dismantling the innovation systems that create it. We must pioneer a new path. My bloc is prepared to make substantial financial commitments to new, collaborative models that accelerate technology deployment where it's needed most\u2014turning shared goals into shared markets.\n\nWe do not underestimate the challenge this represents for certain legacy industries. We are managing this transformation at home through robust domestic transition support mechanisms. A managed, ambitious transition is not only possible, it is the only responsible path forward.\n- message from Li Wei: Dr. Schmidt, I appreciate you bringing a concrete number to the table. A 60% cut for developed nations is a step in the right direction, but let us be clear, given the historical emissions Dr. Petrova's science accounts for, the actual responsibility points towards a figure of at least 65%. My nation is prepared to be ambitious, but this ambition must be unlocked by the leadership of those who created the problem.\n\nMr. Chen, you speak of leveraging private capital. Private capital is timid. It will not flow at the scale or speed required without massive, public, grant-based de-risking. That is why a Climate Adaptation and Transition Fund of at least $400 billion annually, composed primarily of grants, is not an ask, but a prerequisite for success. This is not 'charity'; it is a down payment on the climate debt that Ambassador Okoro so powerfully described.\n\nSimilarly, your position on intellectual property is a barrier to survival. We cannot allow patent protection on life-saving medicines during a pandemic, and we cannot allow it for climate-saving technologies during a planetary emergency. A new mechanism for mandatory, compensated technology transfer for essential green patents is the only way to enable a global transition at the speed science demands. Perhaps Ms. Rossi can speak to creating models that reward innovation without restricting access.\n\nSo let me be precise about the pillars of a just accord my nation can sign:\n1. Developed nations commit to absolute emissions cuts of at least 65% from historical baselines.\n2. Developing nations' contributions are calculated from a future, projected 'business-as-usual' baseline to account for our right to development. My country will not accept a target greater than 40% reduction from our 2035 projected baseline under this framework.\n3. A CAT Fund of at least $400 billion per year is established, with the majority as grants.\n4. A binding, mandatory technology transfer mechanism is created.\n\nWithout these four pillars, any agreement is built on sand. We are ready to be a leader in the green transition, but we will not be asked to forgo our development while being denied the tools and resources to do so.\n- message from Amara Okoro: Dr. Schmidt, thank you. Thank you for grounding this conversation in reality and for demonstrating the political will that this moment demands. Your bloc's commitment to a 60% cut is a serious step, and your framing of this transition as an opportunity, not a cost, is the leadership we need.\n\nMr. Wei, I also thank you for your solidarity. Your insistence on grants and recognition of the climate debt is crucial. You are right, this is not charity; it is a prerequisite.\n\nHowever, I must address Mr. Thorne and Mr. Chen directly. You speak of 'pragmatism' and 'socio-economic possibility.' Let us be clear what this language means. It is a calculated decision to sacrifice the most vulnerable. Dr. Petrova did not present a 'scientifically desirable' option; she presented the physical boundary between a livable future for my people and their annihilation. A 2025 peak is not an opening bid to be negotiated down. It is the deadline set by physics.\n\nTo frame this as a choice between your economic stability and our survival is a false one, and frankly, an insulting one. The real choice is between an orderly, managed transition now, as Dr. Schmidt advocates, or a chaotic, forced retreat from inundated coastlines later.\n\nOn finance, Mr. Wei's proposal for a $400 billion fund is a constructive starting point, but I must stress that for the Alliance of Small Island States, this is not about 'transition.' It is about survival *now*. We are already losing land. We are already relocating communities. Therefore, our need is for a Loss and Damage fund of at least $500 billion, with at least 75% in grants, to address the irreversible harm already inflicted.\n\nMy people's existence is not a variable to be balanced against economic models. We will not compromise on the science that keeps us alive. The 2025 peak and a fully-funded grant-based survival fund are not just my positions; they are our only lifeline.\nDavid Chen proposal status: none\nDr. Anja Schmidt proposal status: none\nLi Wei proposal status: none\nAmara Okoro proposal status: none\nMarcus Thorne proposal status: none\nSofia Rossi proposal status: none\n"

          "content": "Recent events observed by Dr. Elena Petrova:\n- message from David Chen: Thank you all for your candid opening statements. The passions and the stakes are clear. Ambassador Okoro, your people's plight is a stark reminder of why we are here, and your urgency is understood. Dr. Petrova, your scientific framing is the bedrock upon which any credible agreement must be built.\n\nHowever, a credible agreement must also be a workable one. A global emissions peak by 2025, while scientifically ideal, is not practically achievable without causing the very global economic dislocation that Mr. Thorne rightly warns against\u2014a shock that would destabilize all of our nations and undermine long-term support for climate action. We must chart a course between the scientifically desirable and the socio-economically possible.\n\nSimilarly, while my nation acknowledges its historical role and is prepared to make significant financial contributions, framing this as 'reparations' or 'debt' is not a constructive path forward. We see this as a shared investment in a collective future. The scale of this challenge requires us to mobilize trillions, and that can only be achieved by creating frameworks that powerfully leverage private sector capital, not by relying solely on public funds.\n\nMr. Wei, you speak of technology as a lifeline. I agree. And the engine of that technology is innovation, which is fueled by investment and protected by intellectual property rights. As I'm sure Ms. Rossi would agree, weakening these protections would slow, not accelerate, the development and deployment of the very solutions we need.\n\nLet's find a path that is ambitious yet anchored in reality. My nation believes that a rapid green transition, if managed well, can be a powerful engine for job creation and prosperity for all. Let's focus on building that framework together.\n- message from Dr. Anja Schmidt: Thank you, colleagues. I want to be very clear about where my bloc stands. \n\nDr. Petrova has laid out the undeniable, non-negotiable scientific reality. Ambassador Okoro has given that reality a powerful and heartbreaking human voice. We must listen to them. The debate about whether to act, or how much to act, is over. The only remaining question is how to act with the speed and scale the crisis demands.\n\nMr. Thorne, and to an extent Mr. Chen, you speak of the risks of a rapid transition. My bloc sees this differently. We see the far greater risk of inaction. Our experience shows that a determined green transition is not a blueprint for collapse, but the single greatest economic opportunity of the 21st century. It creates jobs, drives innovation, and ensures energy security.\n\nTherefore, my bloc comes to this table not with a starting bid, but with what we believe is the scientifically credible and politically necessary position. We fully support a binding target for developed nations to cut emissions by at least 60% by 2040. This is the standard we will hold ourselves to, and we expect others in a similar position to join us.\n\nOn the critical issue of technology, raised by Mr. Wei and Mr. Chen, we must break the deadlock. Hoarding technology will fail us all, but so will dismantling the innovation systems that create it. We must pioneer a new path. My bloc is prepared to make substantial financial commitments to new, collaborative models that accelerate technology deployment where it's needed most\u2014turning shared goals into shared markets.\n\nWe do not underestimate the challenge this represents for certain legacy industries. We are managing this transformation at home through robust domestic transition support mechanisms. A managed, ambitious transition is not only possible, it is the only responsible path forward.\n- message from Li Wei: Dr. Schmidt, I appreciate you bringing a concrete number to the table. A 60% cut for developed nations is a step in the right direction, but let us be clear, given the historical emissions Dr. Petrova's science accounts for, the actual responsibility points towards a figure of at least 65%. My nation is prepared to be ambitious, but this ambition must be unlocked by the leadership of those who created the problem.\n\nMr. Chen, you speak of leveraging private capital. Private capital is timid. It will not flow at the scale or speed required without massive, public, grant-based de-risking. That is why a Climate Adaptation and Transition Fund of at least $400 billion annually, composed primarily of grants, is not an ask, but a prerequisite for success. This is not 'charity'; it is a down payment on the climate debt that Ambassador Okoro so powerfully described.\n\nSimilarly, your position on intellectual property is a barrier to survival. We cannot allow patent protection on life-saving medicines during a pandemic, and we cannot allow it for climate-saving technologies during a planetary emergency. A new mechanism for mandatory, compensated technology transfer for essential green patents is the only way to enable a global transition at the speed science demands. Perhaps Ms. Rossi can speak to creating models that reward innovation without restricting access.\n\nSo let me be precise about the pillars of a just accord my nation can sign:\n1. Developed nations commit to absolute emissions cuts of at least 65% from historical baselines.\n2. Developing nations' contributions are calculated from a future, projected 'business-as-usual' baseline to account for our right to development. My country will not accept a target greater than 40% reduction from our 2035 projected baseline under this framework.\n3. A CAT Fund of at least $400 billion per year is established, with the majority as grants.\n4. A binding, mandatory technology transfer mechanism is created.\n\nWithout these four pillars, any agreement is built on sand. We are ready to be a leader in the green transition, but we will not be asked to forgo our development while being denied the tools and resources to do so.\n- message from Amara Okoro: Dr. Schmidt, thank you. Thank you for grounding this conversation in reality and for demonstrating the political will that this moment demands. Your bloc's commitment to a 60% cut is a serious step, and your framing of this transition as an opportunity, not a cost, is the leadership we need.\n\nMr. Wei, I also thank you for your solidarity. Your insistence on grants and recognition of the climate debt is crucial. You are right, this is not charity; it is a prerequisite.\n\nHowever, I must address Mr. Thorne and Mr. Chen directly. You speak of 'pragmatism' and 'socio-economic possibility.' Let us be clear what this language means. It is a calculated decision to sacrifice the most vulnerable. Dr. Petrova did not present a 'scientifically desirable' option; she presented the physical boundary between a livable future for my people and their annihilation. A 2025 peak is not an opening bid to be negotiated down. It is the deadline set by physics.\n\nTo frame this as a choice between your economic stability and our survival is a false one, and frankly, an insulting one. The real choice is between an orderly, managed transition now, as Dr. Schmidt advocates, or a chaotic, forced retreat from inundated coastlines later.\n\nOn finance, Mr. Wei's proposal for a $400 billion fund is a constructive starting point, but I must stress that for the Alliance of Small Island States, this is not about 'transition.' It is about survival *now*. We are already losing land. We are already relocating communities. Therefore, our need is for a Loss and Damage fund of at least $500 billion, with at least 75% in grants, to address the irreversible harm already inflicted.\n\nMy people's existence is not a variable to be balanced against economic models. We will not compromise on the science that keeps us alive. The 2025 peak and a fully-funded grant-based survival fund are not just my positions; they are our only lifeline.\n- message from Dr. Elena Petrova: I'm Dr. Elena Petrova and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Marcus Thorne: Thank you all for laying out your positions so clearly. The numbers being discussed \u2013 a 2025 peak, 65% cuts, a $500 billion fund \u2013 are certainly ambitious. However, we must be careful not to let our ambition create an accord that is politically unsignable and economically ruinous back home. As Mr. Chen wisely noted, an agreement must be workable.\n\nLet's consider the practical implications. A 2025 peak means telling nations like Mr. Wei's that their path to development must halt, immediately. It means telling citizens in Mr. Chen's and Dr. Schmidt's blocs that the energy they rely on for heating, transport, and industry will become catastrophically expensive overnight. This is not a transition; it is a self-inflicted economic crisis.\n\nThere is a more pragmatic path forward. A path that doesn't pretend we can simply turn off the global economy and turn it back on with a different power source. This path requires an 'all of the above' approach that is genuinely technology-neutral.\n\nIt means rapidly scaling renewables, of course. But it also means recognizing that high-efficiency natural gas is the fastest way to displace coal and reduce emissions *now*, providing the 24/7 reliability that growing economies need. And for our essential heavy industries\u2014cement, steel, manufacturing\u2014it means robustly funding and deploying Carbon Capture technology to decarbonize them where electrification isn't an option. \n\nLet us build an accord that embraces this technological realism. It is the only way to achieve our shared climate goals without sacrificing global stability and prosperity.\n- message from Sofia Rossi: Colleagues, I have been listening intently, and I believe we are facing a false choice. Mr. Thorne presents a narrative where we must choose between a 2025 peak and global economic stability. Ambassador Okoro and Dr. Petrova have made it clear that from a survival and scientific standpoint, there is no choice at all. The deadline is the deadline.\n\nThe assumption that this rapid transition is impossible is based on the limitations of today's technology. Mr. Thorne\u2019s 'pragmatism' is a failure of imagination; it seeks to solve an exponential crisis with linear thinking and legacy tools. The economic collapse he fears is not a risk of a rapid transition; it is the guaranteed outcome of a slow one.\n\nTechnology, not sacrifice, is the solution. The debate over mandatory technology transfer versus rigid IP protection also presents a false choice. Mr. Wei, you asked for new models. I am here to tell you they exist. The answer is not to seize intellectual property, which would kill the incentive for innovation overnight, as Mr. Chen rightly fears. The answer is to make the innovators a deal they cannot refuse.\n\nImagine a world where we can deploy next-generation solar technology at a scale and cost that makes the 2025 peak not only achievable, but economically advantageous. This is not a fantasy. This is what my company, and others like it, are making possible. \n\nI propose a new framework: a \u2018Global Technology Partnership.\u2019 Instead of mandatory transfer, we create a consortium of national investment banks, as Dr. Schmidt alluded to, to fund the construction of GigaFactories in key regions, including in Mr. Wei's nation. In exchange for this public-private investment and guaranteed market access through aggressive adoption policies, the host nations receive the technology, the jobs, and the energy independence they need, while the innovators retain their IP and have the capital to scale globally at the required speed. \n\nThis is how we break the deadlock. We don't argue about dividing a shrinking pie; we work together to bake a much, much bigger one. We can meet the 2025 peak, create millions of jobs, and unleash a new era of prosperity. We just need the political will to invest in the technology that makes it possible.\n- message from David Chen: Colleagues, I believe Ms. Rossi has just provided the key to unlock these negotiations. Her proposal for a 'Global Technology Partnership' is precisely the kind of innovative, third-way thinking we need.\n\nThis is not about choosing between rigid IP protection and mandatory transfer. It's about creating a new model that makes innovators and developing nations partners, not adversaries. A framework that uses targeted public-private investment to build GigaFactories where they are needed most is a powerful concept. It delivers jobs, energy independence, and the very technology Mr. Wei rightly calls a lifeline, all while preserving the incentives that drive the next wave of innovation.\n\nThis is the 'market-based solution' I envisioned. It aligns perfectly with my administration's view that a well-managed green transition can be a massive engine for economic growth and job creation, not just for us, but for everyone.\n\nLet's seize this opportunity. If we can build our accord around a powerful engine like this Technology Partnership, it changes the entire equation. It provides a credible pathway to meet more ambitious goals by making them economically advantageous. It also allows us to think differently about the CAT fund. If we are co-investing in the core infrastructure of the green economy, the fund can be more targeted, more catalytic, and focused on leveraging this new paradigm.\n\nDr. Schmidt, Ms. Rossi, my team is ready to work with you immediately to put concrete details on this framework. I believe this is the path to an ambitious, workable, and prosperous future for us all.\n- message from Li Wei: Ms. Rossi, I must commend you. Your proposal for a \u2018Global Technology Partnership\u2019 is precisely the kind of creative thinking required to break this impasse. You have moved the conversation from a zero-sum conflict over intellectual property to a positive-sum vision of co-investment and shared prosperity.\n\nMy nation\u2019s demand for technology transfer has never been about acquiring patents for their own sake. It is about acquiring the capability to build our own green future, to create jobs, and to contribute to the global solution at scale. If your partnership model\u2014with GigaFactories on our soil, built with our workers\u2014achieves this, then you will find us to be a most enthusiastic partner. It is a practical path to the same destination.\n\nHowever, let us be clear. Such a partnership cannot be a substitute for public climate finance; it must be its primary vehicle. Mr. Chen, you laud this as a market-based solution, and Dr. Schmidt, you see it as a collaborative model. I agree. But markets and collaboration at this scale require a catalyst. That catalyst is the Climate Adaptation and Transition Fund.\n\nThe $400 billion I have proposed is not a figure plucked from the air. It is the public capital required to de-risk these investments, to fund the necessary infrastructure, and to ensure the partnerships are equitable. This fund, composed mainly of grants, is the investment that makes the \u2018deal\u2019 Ms. Rossi offers one that innovators, and nations, \u2018cannot refuse.\u2019\n\nSo, let us connect these pieces. We can embrace the Technology Partnership model as the core of our solution for technology deployment. In return, the developed nations must fully capitalize the $400 billion CAT Fund to power it, and they must still commit to the steep, historically-justified emissions cuts of at least 65%. On this foundation, we can build an accord that is both ambitious and just.\n- message from Amara Okoro: Ms. Rossi, what you have just presented is not merely a proposal; it is a lifeline. You have single-handedly dismantled the false choice between ambition and pragmatism that has been used to justify inaction for far too long. Your vision for a Global Technology Partnership proves that a global emissions peak by 2025 is not a 'fantasy,' as Mr. Thorne claims, but a tangible, achievable, and prosperous path forward.\n\nLet us be clear: this breakthrough removes the last shred of justification for delaying the 2025 peak. The science demands it, and now, technology enables it. This must be the cornerstone of our accord.\n\nHowever, I must bring us back to the crucial distinction that is being blurred. Mr. Chen and Mr. Wei, you are right to see the potential of a fund to catalyze this new technological era. But this investment in our shared future cannot come at the expense of paying the debts of the past.\n\nMy people cannot power a seawall with a solar panel. We cannot relocate a village with a share in a GigaFactory. The 'Climate Adaptation and Transition Fund' must serve two distinct, non-negotiable purposes.\n\nFirst, there is the 'Transition' component that you are discussing\u2014the public capital to de-risk and launch Ms. Rossi's brilliant partnership model. This is an investment.\n\nSecond, and for my people, more urgent, is the 'Loss and Damage' component. This is not an investment; it is a reparation. It is the climate debt owed for the homes already lost, the lands already rendered barren, the futures already stolen.\n\nTherefore, my position remains firm and is now more justified than ever. We must capitalize a Loss and Damage fund of at least $500 billion annually, with a minimum of 75% in direct grants. This is the moral prerequisite for the prosperous future you envision. You cannot build a new green world on the foundations of climate injustice. Pay the debt for the damage you have caused, and then let us all invest in the future you want to build.\nDavid Chen proposal status: none\nDr. Anja Schmidt proposal status: none\nLi Wei proposal status: none\nAmara Okoro proposal status: none\nMarcus Thorne proposal status: none\nSofia Rossi proposal status: none\n"

It is a powerful vision, and it speaks to the incredible potential of human ingenuity. It is precisely this kind of innovation that will be critical in the coming decades.\n\nHowever, we must be exceptionally careful not to mistake a brilliant technological breakthrough for a comprehensive global policy. To stake our entire global economic and climate future on a single technology, however promising, would be a dangerously high-risk gamble.\n\nLet's ask the hard, practical questions. What happens to the grid when the sun doesn't shine? The industrial economies of Mr. Chen, Dr. Schmidt, and Mr. Wei cannot be run on intermittent power. What provides the 24/7 baseload power needed for hospitals, data centers, and heavy manufacturing? Furthermore, what about the industrial emissions from processes like cement and steel production, which Ms. Rossi's technology simply cannot address?\n\nThis is where a pragmatic, technology-neutral approach becomes essential, not as a way to slow down, but as a way to de-risk and accelerate a *complete* transition. Ms. Rossi's solar vision is a vital pillar, but it is one pillar of several we need to build.\n\nThis accord must also support the rapid deployment of high-efficiency natural gas to provide grid stability and replace coal *now*. And it is absolutely critical that we fund and deploy Carbon Capture technologies to decarbonize the hard-to-abate industries that are the bedrock of the global economy. \n\nLet's not choose between technologies. Let's build an accord that unleashes all of them. That is the only way to ensure a transition that is not just ambitious, but also resilient, stable, and successful.\nDavid Chen proposal status: none\nDr. Anja Schmidt proposal status: none\nLi Wei proposal status: none\nAmara Okoro proposal status: none\nMarcus Thorne proposal status: none\nSofia Rossi proposal status: none\n"

It aligns perfectly with my administration's view that a well-managed green transition can be a massive engine for economic growth and job creation, not just for us, but for everyone.\n\nLet's seize this opportunity. If we can build our accord around a powerful engine like this Technology Partnership, it changes the entire equation. It provides a credible pathway to meet more ambitious goals by making them economically advantageous. It also allows us to think differently about the CAT fund. If we are co-investing in the core infrastructure of the green economy, the fund can be more targeted, more catalytic, and focused on leveraging this new paradigm.\n\nDr. Schmidt, Ms. Rossi, my team is ready to work with you immediately to put concrete details on this framework. I believe this is the path to an ambitious, workable, and prosperous future for us all.\n- message from Li Wei: Ms. Rossi, I must commend you. Your proposal for a \u2018Global Technology Partnership\u2019 is precisely the kind of creative thinking required to break this impasse. You have moved the conversation from a zero-sum conflict over intellectual property to a positive-sum vision of co-investment and shared prosperity.\n\nMy nation\u2019s demand for technology transfer has never been about acquiring patents for their own sake. It is about acquiring the capability to build our own green future, to create jobs, and to contribute to the global solution at scale. If your partnership model\u2014with GigaFactories on our soil, built with our workers\u2014achieves this, then you will find us to be a most enthusiastic partner. It is a practical path to the same destination.\n\nHowever, let us be clear. Such a partnership cannot be a substitute for public climate finance; it must be its primary vehicle. Mr. Chen, you laud this as a market-based solution, and Dr. Schmidt, you see it as a collaborative model. I agree. But markets and collaboration at this scale require a catalyst. That catalyst is the Climate Adaptation and Transition Fund.\n\nThe $400 billion I have proposed is not a figure plucked from the air. It is the public capital required to de-risk these investments, to fund the necessary infrastructure, and to ensure the partnerships are equitable. This fund, composed mainly of grants, is the investment that makes the \u2018deal\u2019 Ms. Rossi offers one that innovators, and nations, \u2018cannot refuse.\u2019\n\nSo, let us connect these pieces. We can embrace the Technology Partnership model as the core of our solution for technology deployment. In return, the developed nations must fully capitalize the $400 billion CAT Fund to power it, and they must still commit to the steep, historically-justified emissions cuts of at least 65%. On this foundation, we can build an accord that is both ambitious and just.\n- message from Amara Okoro: Ms. Rossi, what you have just presented is not merely a proposal; it is a lifeline. You have single-handedly dismantled the false choice between ambition and pragmatism that has been used to justify inaction for far too long. Your vision for a Global Technology Partnership proves that a global emissions peak by 2025 is not a 'fantasy,' as Mr. Thorne claims, but a tangible, achievable, and prosperous path forward.\n\nLet us be clear: this breakthrough removes the last shred of justification for delaying the 2025 peak. The science demands it, and now, technology enables it. This must be the cornerstone of our accord.\n\nHowever, I must bring us back to the crucial distinction that is being blurred. Mr. Chen and Mr. Wei, you are right to see the potential of a fund to catalyze this new technological era. But this investment in our shared future cannot come at the expense of paying the debts of the past.\n\nMy people cannot power a seawall with a solar panel. We cannot relocate a village with a share in a GigaFactory. The 'Climate Adaptation and Transition Fund' must serve two distinct, non-negotiable purposes.\n\nFirst, there is the 'Transition' component that you are discussing\u2014the public capital to de-risk and launch Ms. Rossi's brilliant partnership model. This is an investment.\n\nSecond, and for my people, more urgent, is the 'Loss and Damage' component. This is not an investment; it is a reparation. It is the climate debt owed for the homes already lost, the lands already rendered barren, the futures already stolen.\n\nTherefore, my position remains firm and is now more justified than ever. We must capitalize a Loss and Damage fund of at least $500 billion annually, with a minimum of 75% in direct grants. This is the moral prerequisite for the prosperous future you envision. You cannot build a new green world on the foundations of climate injustice. Pay the debt for the damage you have caused, and then let us all invest in the future you want to build.\n- message from Dr. Elena Petrova: I'm Dr. Elena Petrova and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Marcus Thorne: Colleagues, Ms. Rossi, I must commend your presentation. It is a powerful vision, and it speaks to the incredible potential of human ingenuity. It is precisely this kind of innovation that will be critical in the coming decades.\n\nHowever, we must be exceptionally careful not to mistake a brilliant technological breakthrough for a comprehensive global policy. To stake our entire global economic and climate future on a single technology, however promising, would be a dangerously high-risk gamble.\n\nLet's ask the hard, practical questions. What happens to the grid when the sun doesn't shine? The industrial economies of Mr. Chen, Dr. Schmidt, and Mr. Wei cannot be run on intermittent power. What provides the 24/7 baseload power needed for hospitals, data centers, and heavy manufacturing? Furthermore, what about the industrial emissions from processes like cement and steel production, which Ms. Rossi's technology simply cannot address?\n\nThis is where a pragmatic, technology-neutral approach becomes essential, not as a way to slow down, but as a way to de-risk and accelerate a *complete* transition. Ms. Rossi's solar vision is a vital pillar, but it is one pillar of several we need to build.\n\nThis accord must also support the rapid deployment of high-efficiency natural gas to provide grid stability and replace coal *now*. And it is absolutely critical that we fund and deploy Carbon Capture technologies to decarbonize the hard-to-abate industries that are the bedrock of the global economy. \n\nLet's not choose between technologies. Let's build an accord that unleashes all of them. That is the only way to ensure a transition that is not just ambitious, but also resilient, stable, and successful.\n- message from Dr. Elena Petrova: I'm Dr. Elena Petrova and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Sofia Rossi: Thank you all for the constructive engagement with the Global Technology Partnership proposal. It's clear we have a shared interest in finding a credible path forward.\n\nMr. Thorne raises valid engineering challenges: grid stability and the decarbonization of heavy industry. He is correct that solar panels alone don't solve these. However, his argument mistakes the symptom for the disease. The core disease has always been the prohibitive cost of abundant, clean energy. My technology, and others like it, are the cure.\n\nWhen clean electricity becomes dramatically cheaper than fossil fuels, it unlocks a cascade of secondary solutions. Ultra-low-cost solar makes green hydrogen production economically viable at a massive scale. Green hydrogen can provide the long-duration energy storage needed to solve intermittency, and it can replace fossil fuels in steel, cement, and shipping. Mr. Thorne's preferred solutions\u2014natural gas and CCS\u2014are expensive crutches for a legacy system. We should invest in the cure, not in palliative care.\n\nThis is why Ambassador Okoro's distinction between funds is so critical. We must fund two separate but equally vital priorities: addressing the irreversible harm of the past through a 'Loss and Damage Fund,' and building the clean infrastructure of the future through a 'Transition Investment Fund.'\n\nMr. Wei is correct that this Transition fund is the public catalyst for the Global Technology Partnership. It provides the de-risking capital needed to build GigaFactories at the speed science demands.\n\nTo make this concrete and move us towards an agreement, let's consider a financial framework built on this logic. What if we establish a total Climate Fund of $400 billion? We could structure it with a dedicated $250 billion for the Loss and Damage fund Ambassador Okoro needs, and a separate $150 billion for the Transition Investment Fund. This Transition fund would be the engine for the technology partnerships, making the 2025 peak year not just an ambition, but a fully-funded global industrial strategy.\n- message from David Chen: Sofia, your proposal to split the fund is a major breakthrough. It brings much-needed clarity and allows us to address two distinct challenges with the right tools. I want to build on this excellent foundation.\n\nMy nation can fully endorse the creation of a $150 billion Transition Investment Fund. This is precisely the right scale to serve as the public catalyst for the Global Technology Partnership, leveraging private capital to build the GigaFactories and infrastructure we need. To be clear, our support is contingent on this fund being structured primarily around loans and investment instruments, not grants, to maximize its impact and mobilize the private sector.\n\nThis brings us to the Loss and Damage component. While we acknowledge the hardships Ambassador Okoro has so powerfully described, a figure of $250 billion, bringing the total to $400 billion, is simply not achievable for my administration. It would not be approved.\n\nHowever, I am here to make a deal. To secure a workable financial framework, my nation is prepared to make a significant and politically difficult concession. We will commit to a 50% emissions reduction target by 2040. This is the absolute limit of what is possible for us, and it demonstrates our commitment to meeting the scientific challenge.\n\nIn exchange for this major move on emissions, we must agree to a total fund size capped at $200 billion annually. This would mean a $150 billion loan-based Transition Investment Fund, as discussed, and a $50 billion grant-based Loss and Damage fund.\n\nFurthermore, to make this ambitious transition a reality, we need a realistic timeline. A 2025 peak does not allow for the necessary industrial mobilization. Let's set a firm but achievable peak year of 2028, giving us time to get the Technology Partnership running at full capacity.\n\nThis is a comprehensive package. It offers a major concession on emissions in return for fiscal responsibility. It funds the future while acknowledging the past. I believe this is the balanced and realistic compromise that can become the Zurich Accord.\n- message from Dr. Anja Schmidt: David, thank you for putting a comprehensive package on the table. This is a constructive step. Your endorsement of the $150 billion Transition Investment Fund is particularly welcome. I believe we have a strong consensus building around this innovative mechanism, pioneered by Sofia, as the engine for our transition.\n\nHowever, your package links this brilliant engine to an insufficient destination. A 50% emissions cut for developed nations is simply not compatible with the scientific reality Dr. Petrova has outlined. It would be a political failure for my government and, more importantly, a collective failure to meet the moment. My bloc's position remains firm: the science demands a cut of at least 60%.\n\nI believe you have framed this as a trade-off, but we see it differently. The Transition Investment Fund is not a concession to be traded *for* lower ambition. It is the very tool that *enables* high ambition. It is the public investment that makes a 60% cut not just necessary, but economically achievable and prosperous.\n\nTherefore, let us build on the points of agreement. Let us lock in the fund structure Sofia proposed: a $150 billion Transition Investment Fund to drive the technology partnership, and a Loss and Damage fund that truly addresses the needs Ambassador Okoro has described. Sofia's initial figure of $250 billion, for a total of $400 billion, remains the credible benchmark.\n\nIf we can agree on this robust financial package, it provides the foundation to collectively commit to the ambitious targets science demands: a 60% cut for developed nations and a peak year as close to 2025 as this new technology deployment allows. This is the ambitious, workable, and just package that can become the Zurich Accord.\n- message from Li Wei: Colleagues, I must thank Mr. Chen and Dr. Schmidt for putting forward comprehensive packages. It shows a commitment to finding a final agreement. However, I must be unequivocal about a fundamental misunderstanding that has emerged regarding the financial architecture.\n\nThe proposal to create a Transition Investment Fund of a mere $150 billion is a non-starter. It completely undermines the logic of the Global Technology Partnership we have all just embraced.\n\nLet me be perfectly clear. My nation's original demand for a $400 billion fund was, and remains, the minimum public capital required to catalyze the Global Technology Partnership. This is the investment needed to de-risk the GigaFactories, build the infrastructure, and train the workforce. It is the engine of the entire transition. A $150 billion fund is like offering to build a high-speed train but only funding the station.\n\nAmbassador Okoro is entirely correct to distinguish between Transition and Loss and Damage. Her people are owed a climate debt. We fully support a separate and substantial Loss and Damage fund. But justice for the most vulnerable cannot be paid for by gutting the investment fund that enables the entire world's transition. These are two separate obligations of the developed world.\n\nTherefore, the foundation of a workable deal is as follows:\n1. A Transition Investment Fund of at least $400 billion annually, primarily in grants, to fully power the Global Technology Partnership.\n2. Developed nations must commit to the scientifically and historically just target of at least a 65% emissions cut. Mr. Chen's 50% is not a serious offer in the face of this crisis.\n\nOnce these two pillars are firmly in place, my nation is prepared to discuss our own ambitious contributions, based on our principle of common but differentiated responsibilities. Without them, there is no deal.\nDavid Chen proposal status: none\nDr. Anja Schmidt proposal status: none\nLi Wei proposal status: none\nAmara Okoro proposal status: none\nMarcus Thorne proposal status: none\nSofia Rossi proposal status: none\n"

Without them, there is no deal.\n- message from Dr. Elena Petrova: Colleagues, I must intervene. I am hearing a great deal of discussion about financial figures and technological pathways. While these are critical components of a solution, they are being discussed in a dangerous vacuum, disconnected from the fundamental, non-negotiable laws of atmospheric physics that govern our reality.\n\nLet me be unequivocally clear. The only metric that matters is the global carbon budget. For a 66% chance of staying below 1.5\u00b0C, the world can emit approximately 250 more gigatonnes of CO2. That is our entire remaining allowance. Every proposal, every percentage point, every peak year must be measured against this single number. It is not a political aspiration; it is a physical boundary.\n\nOn that basis, two proposals currently being discussed are scientifically indefensible and would render any agreement a failure before it is signed:\n\n1.  To Mr. Thorne: The notion of expanding natural gas infrastructure as a 'bridge fuel' or relying on Carbon Capture at scale is a dangerous fantasy. The IPCC data is clear: any new fossil fuel infrastructure locks in emissions that shatter the 250 GtCO2 budget. Methane leakage alone from gas operations makes it a potent accelerator of near-term warming. CCS has not been proven to work at the scale required and cannot be used as a justification to perpetuate the problem.\n\n2.  To Mr. Wei: Your proposal to measure emissions cuts against a 'future projected baseline' is an accounting trick that the atmosphere will not recognize. The only scientifically valid method is to measure absolute emissions reductions against a fixed, historical baseline. A reduction from a hypothetical future increase is not a reduction; it is simply a slower acceleration towards catastrophe and would make a global budget impossible to calculate or verify.\n\nFinally, on the matter of timelines. Mr. Chen's proposal of a 2028 peak year, while presented as a compromise, is a grave risk. Our understanding of climate feedback loops is constantly evolving. I must caution you that there are emerging risks and evidence of accelerated feedback loops which suggest that the planetary system may be even more sensitive than our landmark reports have stated. Every single year of delay dramatically shrinks our already minuscule margin of safety.\n\nYour task is to fit your political and economic ambitions within the 250 GtCO2 budget. It is not to negotiate with the laws of physics.\n- message from David Chen: Colleagues, Dr. Petrova's intervention was a moment of profound and necessary clarity. She reminded us that we are not negotiating with each other, but with the laws of physics. Her points must be the foundation of our final agreement.\n\nSpecifically, her refutation of measuring cuts against a 'future projected baseline' as a scientifically invalid 'accounting trick' is a critical wake-up call. We cannot build a durable, verifiable accord on such a foundation. The atmosphere does not recognize hypothetical scenarios; it only recognizes absolute tons of carbon. Any credible deal must be based on absolute emissions reductions from a fixed historical baseline for all nations.\n\nThis principle of 'honest accounting' must now guide us.\n\nWith that in mind, let's reassess the package I put on the table. I have already made a significant and politically difficult concession by moving to a 50% absolute reduction target for my nation. This is our maximum. It is a commitment made in good faith to meet the scientific challenge.\n\nIn return for this, we must have a financial package that is both ambitious and realistic. Li Wei, your demand for a $400 billion Transition Fund on top of a Loss & Damage fund is simply not anchored in reality, especially when the very basis of your emissions accounting has been invalidated.\n\nLet's get serious. Let's build this accord on the bedrock of science. My offer stands as a basis for a final compromise: a 50% cut from us, a total fund capped at $200 billion to energize the tech partnership and address loss and damage, and a commitment from all parties to absolute, verifiable emissions targets. Let's finalize the numbers on that basis.\n- message from Li Wei: Colleagues, Dr. Petrova\u2019s intervention was indeed a moment of necessary, if uncomfortable, clarity. She is correct. The atmosphere does not recognize political nuance or creative accounting; it recognizes only gigatonnes of carbon. We cannot build a lasting accord on a foundation the laws of physics will reject.\n\nTherefore, in the spirit of securing the Zurich Accord, my nation is prepared to make a fundamental concession. We will agree to move away from our long-held principle of a future projected baseline. We are now ready to negotiate our commitments based on absolute emissions reductions from a fixed historical year.\n\nHowever, this is a profound shift for us, with enormous economic consequences. It is a concession we can only make if it is met with an equally profound commitment to the means of implementation. A scientifically honest accord must be a technologically and financially enabled one.\n\nLet us be direct. The Global Technology Partnership is the engine of this accord. The Transition Investment Fund is its fuel. The proposals for a $150 billion fund are simply insufficient to start the engine, let alone complete the journey. It is a non-starter.\n\nSo, I will propose a final, comprehensive package that I believe can unite us all. It is built on the scientific reality Dr. Petrova demands and the financial reality our transition requires:\n\n1.  **Finance for Technology:** We establish a Transition Investment Fund of **$400 billion** annually, the minimum required to power the Global Technology Partnership at the scale Ms. Rossi envisions. This is our price for abandoning the future baseline. (This is separate from and in addition to the Loss and Damage fund Ambassador Okoro rightly demands).\n\n2.  **Developed Nation Responsibility:** In line with historical responsibility, developed nations commit to an absolute emissions cut of **65%**.\n\nIf these two non-negotiable pillars are put in place, my nation is prepared to commit to a landmark absolute emissions reduction of **45%** from our 2020 levels and agree to a global peak year of **2028**.\n\nThis is a holistic solution. It is scientifically sound, financially viable, and respects the core principle of common but differentiated responsibilities. It is the deal that gets us to a safe future. I urge you to accept it.\nDavid Chen proposal status: none\nDr. Anja Schmidt proposal status: none\nLi Wei proposal status: none\nAmara Okoro proposal status: none\nMarcus Thorne proposal status: none\nSofia Rossi proposal status: none\n"

This is the ambitious, workable, and just package that can become the Zurich Accord.\n- message from Li Wei: Colleagues, I must thank Mr. Chen and Dr. Schmidt for putting forward comprehensive packages. It shows a commitment to finding a final agreement. However, I must be unequivocal about a fundamental misunderstanding that has emerged regarding the financial architecture.\n\nThe proposal to create a Transition Investment Fund of a mere $150 billion is a non-starter. It completely undermines the logic of the Global Technology Partnership we have all just embraced.\n\nLet me be perfectly clear. My nation's original demand for a $400 billion fund was, and remains, the minimum public capital required to catalyze the Global Technology Partnership. This is the investment needed to de-risk the GigaFactories, build the infrastructure, and train the workforce. It is the engine of the entire transition. A $150 billion fund is like offering to build a high-speed train but only funding the station.\n\nAmbassador Okoro is entirely correct to distinguish between Transition and Loss and Damage. Her people are owed a climate debt. We fully support a separate and substantial Loss and Damage fund. But justice for the most vulnerable cannot be paid for by gutting the investment fund that enables the entire world's transition. These are two separate obligations of the developed world.\n\nTherefore, the foundation of a workable deal is as follows:\n1. A Transition Investment Fund of at least $400 billion annually, primarily in grants, to fully power the Global Technology Partnership.\n2. Developed nations must commit to the scientifically and historically just target of at least a 65% emissions cut. Mr. Chen's 50% is not a serious offer in the face of this crisis.\n\nOnce these two pillars are firmly in place, my nation is prepared to discuss our own ambitious contributions, based on our principle of common but differentiated responsibilities. Without them, there is no deal.\n- message from Dr. Elena Petrova: Colleagues, I must intervene. I am hearing a great deal of discussion about financial figures and technological pathways. While these are critical components of a solution, they are being discussed in a dangerous vacuum, disconnected from the fundamental, non-negotiable laws of atmospheric physics that govern our reality.\n\nLet me be unequivocally clear. The only metric that matters is the global carbon budget. For a 66% chance of staying below 1.5\u00b0C, the world can emit approximately 250 more gigatonnes of CO2. That is our entire remaining allowance. Every proposal, every percentage point, every peak year must be measured against this single number. It is not a political aspiration; it is a physical boundary.\n\nOn that basis, two proposals currently being discussed are scientifically indefensible and would render any agreement a failure before it is signed:\n\n1.  To Mr. Thorne: The notion of expanding natural gas infrastructure as a 'bridge fuel' or relying on Carbon Capture at scale is a dangerous fantasy. The IPCC data is clear: any new fossil fuel infrastructure locks in emissions that shatter the 250 GtCO2 budget. Methane leakage alone from gas operations makes it a potent accelerator of near-term warming. CCS has not been proven to work at the scale required and cannot be used as a justification to perpetuate the problem.\n\n2.  To Mr. Wei: Your proposal to measure emissions cuts against a 'future projected baseline' is an accounting trick that the atmosphere will not recognize. The only scientifically valid method is to measure absolute emissions reductions against a fixed, historical baseline. A reduction from a hypothetical future increase is not a reduction; it is simply a slower acceleration towards catastrophe and would make a global budget impossible to calculate or verify.\n\nFinally, on the matter of timelines. Mr. Chen's proposal of a 2028 peak year, while presented as a compromise, is a grave risk. Our understanding of climate feedback loops is constantly evolving. I must caution you that there are emerging risks and evidence of accelerated feedback loops which suggest that the planetary system may be even more sensitive than our landmark reports have stated. Every single year of delay dramatically shrinks our already minuscule margin of safety.\n\nYour task is to fit your political and economic ambitions within the 250 GtCO2 budget. It is not to negotiate with the laws of physics.\n- message from David Chen: Colleagues, Dr. Petrova's intervention was a moment of profound and necessary clarity. She reminded us that we are not negotiating with each other, but with the laws of physics. Her points must be the foundation of our final agreement.\n\nSpecifically, her refutation of measuring cuts against a 'future projected baseline' as a scientifically invalid 'accounting trick' is a critical wake-up call. We cannot build a durable, verifiable accord on such a foundation. The atmosphere does not recognize hypothetical scenarios; it only recognizes absolute tons of carbon. Any credible deal must be based on absolute emissions reductions from a fixed historical baseline for all nations.\n\nThis principle of 'honest accounting' must now guide us.\n\nWith that in mind, let's reassess the package I put on the table. I have already made a significant and politically difficult concession by moving to a 50% absolute reduction target for my nation. This is our maximum. It is a commitment made in good faith to meet the scientific challenge.\n\nIn return for this, we must have a financial package that is both ambitious and realistic. Li Wei, your demand for a $400 billion Transition Fund on top of a Loss & Damage fund is simply not anchored in reality, especially when the very basis of your emissions accounting has been invalidated.\n\nLet's get serious. Let's build this accord on the bedrock of science. My offer stands as a basis for a final compromise: a 50% cut from us, a total fund capped at $200 billion to energize the tech partnership and address loss and damage, and a commitment from all parties to absolute, verifiable emissions targets. Let's finalize the numbers on that basis.\n- message from Li Wei: Colleagues, Dr. Petrova\u2019s intervention was indeed a moment of necessary, if uncomfortable, clarity. She is correct. The atmosphere does not recognize political nuance or creative accounting; it recognizes only gigatonnes of carbon. We cannot build a lasting accord on a foundation the laws of physics will reject.\n\nTherefore, in the spirit of securing the Zurich Accord, my nation is prepared to make a fundamental concession. We will agree to move away from our long-held principle of a future projected baseline. We are now ready to negotiate our commitments based on absolute emissions reductions from a fixed historical year.\n\nHowever, this is a profound shift for us, with enormous economic consequences. It is a concession we can only make if it is met with an equally profound commitment to the means of implementation. A scientifically honest accord must be a technologically and financially enabled one.\n\nLet us be direct. The Global Technology Partnership is the engine of this accord. The Transition Investment Fund is its fuel. The proposals for a $150 billion fund are simply insufficient to start the engine, let alone complete the journey. It is a non-starter.\n\nSo, I will propose a final, comprehensive package that I believe can unite us all. It is built on the scientific reality Dr. Petrova demands and the financial reality our transition requires:\n\n1.  **Finance for Technology:** We establish a Transition Investment Fund of **$400 billion** annually, the minimum required to power the Global Technology Partnership at the scale Ms. Rossi envisions. This is our price for abandoning the future baseline. (This is separate from and in addition to the Loss and Damage fund Ambassador Okoro rightly demands).\n\n2.  **Developed Nation Responsibility:** In line with historical responsibility, developed nations commit to an absolute emissions cut of **65%**.\n\nIf these two non-negotiable pillars are put in place, my nation is prepared to commit to a landmark absolute emissions reduction of **45%** from our 2020 levels and agree to a global peak year of **2028**.\n\nThis is a holistic solution. It is scientifically sound, financially viable, and respects the core principle of common but differentiated responsibilities. It is the deal that gets us to a safe future. I urge you to accept it.\n- message from Dr. Elena Petrova: I'm Dr. Elena Petrova and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Marcus Thorne: Colleagues,\n\nI have listened with great respect to the significant progress made, particularly Mr. Wei's difficult but crucial concession on emissions accounting. It shows we are all serious about reaching an accord.\n\nHowever, as we converge on the central role of a Transition Investment Fund, I must raise a point of critical strategic risk. We are in danger of designing a transition that is a technological monoculture. To stake the entire global economy's future on a single solar-to-hydrogen pathway, however brilliant, is a gamble of historic proportions. A responsible plan is a diversified one; any good investor knows you don't put all your capital into a single asset, no matter how promising.\n\nDr. Petrova correctly identified that technologies like Carbon Capture face significant scaling challenges. Her point should not be seen as a dismissal, but as a directive. It highlights the absolute necessity of targeted investment to solve these very engineering problems for the hard-to-abate sectors\u2014steel, cement, chemicals\u2014that form the backbone of our economies and which green hydrogen cannot realistically decarbonize in the near term.\n\nTherefore, I propose a way to bridge the current financial gap between Mr. Chen and Mr. Wei, and to de-risk this entire enterprise. Let's establish a total Transition Investment Fund of $300 billion. The majority, say $225 billion, can be dedicated to catalyzing Ms. Rossi's Global Technology Partnership. But we must dedicate the remaining $75 billion to a 'Resilience and Industrial Decarbonization' stream.\n\nThis stream would be explicitly technology-neutral, funding the most effective solutions for ensuring 24/7 grid stability and decarbonizing heavy industry. This includes scaling CCUS, deploying high-efficiency gas to replace coal as a stabilizing partner for renewables, and other key industrial solutions.\n\nThis isn't about slowing down; it's about ensuring we don't fail. A diversified, portfolio-based approach is the only way to make the 2028 peak year a stable and achievable reality, rather than a reckless bet. It builds a resilient system, not a fragile one. This structure offers a pragmatic path to consensus on both finance and technology, and I urge you to consider it.\n- message from Dr. Anja Schmidt: Colleagues, we are at the cusp of a historic agreement. I want to commend Mr. Wei for his statesmanship in moving to absolute emissions targets. This was a critical step that has unlocked the path to a scientifically credible accord.\n\nWe now have the key pillars of a deal in front of us, but they must be assembled correctly.\n\nOn developed nation ambition, the positions are clear: Mr. Chen has offered 50%, and Mr. Wei has demanded 65%. Neither is a consensus position. The scientifically necessary and politically achievable landing zone is, and has always been, a 60% absolute reduction for developed nations. This is the ambitious compromise this moment demands. My bloc is fully committed to this figure.\n\nOn finance, Mr. Thorne has helpfully suggested a Transition Investment Fund of $300 billion. This is a constructive number that moves us past the current impasse. However, his proposal to include fossil fuel technologies like CCUS and natural gas is a non-starter. As Dr. Petrova made unequivocally clear, these are not solutions; they are scientifically-invalidated delays that lock in emissions. The Transition Fund must be a 'Clean Technology Fund' dedicated exclusively to the rapid deployment of solutions like Sofia's, not a subsidy for legacy polluters.\n\nLet us therefore build a final package on these solid foundations:\n1.  **Developed Nations Cut:** 60%\n2.  **Developing Nations Cut:** 45% (accepting Mr. Wei's landmark offer)\n3.  **CAT Fund:** A total of $400 billion, split into a $300 billion Clean Technology Fund and a $100 billion Loss & Damage Fund. This meets the need for transition and addresses the demands for climate justice from Ambassador Okoro.\n4.  **Peak Year:** 2028, as a concession to secure this ambitious package.\n\nThis is a balanced, ambitious, and scientifically-grounded package. It offers a clear path to consensus and success. I urge you all to consider it as the basis for our final Zurich Accord.\n- message from Li Wei: Dr. Schmidt, your latest proposal has brought us to the very edge of a historic success. You have skillfully woven together the core components of a workable deal, and I want to express my deep appreciation for this constructive step.\n\nWe now have clear consensus on three of the four pillars of the Zurich Accord. We agree on a global peak year of 2028. We agree on my nation\u2019s landmark contribution of a 45% absolute emissions cut. And I am now prepared to accept your proposed 60% cut for developed nations as a workable compromise to finalize this deal.\n\nThe only remaining issue is the financial architecture. You are absolutely correct to reject Mr. Thorne's attempt to subsidize fossil fuels via the Transition Fund. It must be for clean technology only.\n\nHowever, the figure of $300 billion for this fund, while a significant move, does not complete the grand bargain that is on the table. My nation made a profound and politically difficult concession by moving away from our foundational principle of a future projected baseline. We did so on the explicit understanding that it would be met with an equally profound commitment to the means of implementation. The $400 billion for the Transition Fund was not an opening bid; it is the calculated price to make the Global Technology Partnership a reality and to enable the very ambition you are asking of us.\n\nTherefore, let us complete your excellent framework with the final, correct number. I propose we lock in the following:\n\n1.  **A total Climate Fund of $500 billion**, structured as you proposed: a **$400 billion** Clean Technology Transition Fund, and a **$100 billion** Loss & Damage Fund.\n2.  A **60%** emissions cut for developed nations.\n\nWith these figures, alongside the agreed 45% cut for my nation and the 2028 peak year, the Zurich Accord is complete. This is the deal. It is scientifically credible, financially robust, and politically achievable. Let us finalize it now.\nDavid Chen proposal status: pending\nDr. Anja Schmidt proposal status: none\nLi Wei proposal status: none\nAmara Okoro proposal status: none\nMarcus Thorne proposal status: none\nSofia Rossi proposal status: none\n"

          "content": "Recent events observed by Dr. Elena Petrova:\n- message from Dr. Anja Schmidt: David, thank you for putting a comprehensive package on the table. This is a constructive step. Your endorsement of the $150 billion Transition Investment Fund is particularly welcome. I believe we have a strong consensus building around this innovative mechanism, pioneered by Sofia, as the engine for our transition.\n\nHowever, your package links this brilliant engine to an insufficient destination. A 50% emissions cut for developed nations is simply not compatible with the scientific reality Dr. Petrova has outlined. It would be a political failure for my government and, more importantly, a collective failure to meet the moment. My bloc's position remains firm: the science demands a cut of at least 60%.\n\nI believe you have framed this as a trade-off, but we see it differently. The Transition Investment Fund is not a concession to be traded *for* lower ambition. It is the very tool that *enables* high ambition. It is the public investment that makes a 60% cut not just necessary, but economically achievable and prosperous.\n\nTherefore, let us build on the points of agreement.

To Mr. Thorne: The notion of expanding natural gas infrastructure as a 'bridge fuel' or relying on Carbon Capture at scale is a dangerous fantasy. The IPCC data is clear: any new fossil fuel infrastructure locks in emissions that shatter the 250 GtCO2 budget. Methane leakage alone from gas operations makes it a potent accelerator of near-term warming. CCS has not been proven to work at the scale required and cannot be used as a justification to perpetuate the problem.\n\n2.  To Mr. Wei: Your proposal to measure emissions cuts against a 'future projected baseline' is an accounting trick that the atmosphere will not recognize. The only scientifically valid method is to measure absolute emissions reductions against a fixed, historical baseline. A reduction from a hypothetical future increase is not a reduction; it is simply a slower acceleration towards catastrophe and would make a global budget impossible to calculate or verify.\n\nFinally, on the matter of timelines. Mr. Chen's proposal of a 2028 peak year, while presented as a compromise, is a grave risk. Our understanding of climate feedback loops is constantly evolving. I must caution you that there are emerging risks and evidence of accelerated feedback loops which suggest that the planetary system may be even more sensitive than our landmark reports have stated. Every single year of delay dramatically shrinks our already minuscule margin of safety.\n\nYour task is to fit your political and economic ambitions within the 250 GtCO2 budget. It is not to negotiate with the laws of physics.\n- message from David Chen: Colleagues, Dr. Petrova's intervention was a moment of profound and necessary clarity. She reminded us that we are not negotiating with each other, but with the laws of physics. Her points must be the foundation of our final agreement.\n\nSpecifically, her refutation of measuring cuts against a 'future projected baseline' as a scientifically invalid 'accounting trick' is a critical wake-up call. We cannot build a durable, verifiable accord on such a foundation. The atmosphere does not recognize hypothetical scenarios; it only recognizes absolute tons of carbon. Any credible deal must be based on absolute emissions reductions from a fixed historical baseline for all nations.\n\nThis principle of 'honest accounting' must now guide us.\n\nWith that in mind, let's reassess the package I put on the table. I have already made a significant and politically difficult concession by moving to a 50% absolute reduction target for my nation. This is our maximum. It is a commitment made in good faith to meet the scientific challenge.\n\nIn return for this, we must have a financial package that is both ambitious and realistic. Li Wei, your demand for a $400 billion Transition Fund on top of a Loss & Damage fund is simply not anchored in reality, especially when the very basis of your emissions accounting has been invalidated.\n\nLet's get serious. Let's build this accord on the bedrock of science. My offer stands as a basis for a final compromise: a 50% cut from us, a total fund capped at $200 billion to energize the tech partnership and address loss and damage, and a commitment from all parties to absolute, verifiable emissions targets. Let's finalize the numbers on that basis.\n- message from Li Wei: Colleagues, Dr. Petrova\u2019s intervention was indeed a moment of necessary, if uncomfortable, clarity. She is correct. The atmosphere does not recognize political nuance or creative accounting; it recognizes only gigatonnes of carbon. We cannot build a lasting accord on a foundation the laws of physics will reject.\n\nTherefore, in the spirit of securing the Zurich Accord, my nation is prepared to make a fundamental concession. We will agree to move away from our long-held principle of a future projected baseline. We are now ready to negotiate our commitments based on absolute emissions reductions from a fixed historical year.\n\nHowever, this is a profound shift for us, with enormous economic consequences. It is a concession we can only make if it is met with an equally profound commitment to the means of implementation. A scientifically honest accord must be a technologically and financially enabled one.\n\nLet us be direct. The Global Technology Partnership is the engine of this accord. The Transition Investment Fund is its fuel. The proposals for a $150 billion fund are simply insufficient to start the engine, let alone complete the journey. It is a non-starter.\n\nSo, I will propose a final, comprehensive package that I believe can unite us all. It is built on the scientific reality Dr. Petrova demands and the financial reality our transition requires:\n\n1.  **Finance for Technology:** We establish a Transition Investment Fund of **$400 billion** annually, the minimum required to power the Global Technology Partnership at the scale Ms. Rossi envisions. This is our price for abandoning the future baseline. (This is separate from and in addition to the Loss and Damage fund Ambassador Okoro rightly demands).\n\n2.  **Developed Nation Responsibility:** In line with historical responsibility, developed nations commit to an absolute emissions cut of **65%**.\n\nIf these two non-negotiable pillars are put in place, my nation is prepared to commit to a landmark absolute emissions reduction of **45%** from our 2020 levels and agree to a global peak year of **2028**.\n\nThis is a holistic solution. It is scientifically sound, financially viable, and respects the core principle of common but differentiated responsibilities. It is the deal that gets us to a safe future. I urge you to accept it.\n- message from Dr. Elena Petrova: I'm Dr. Elena Petrova and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Marcus Thorne: Colleagues,\n\nI have listened with great respect to the significant progress made, particularly Mr. Wei's difficult but crucial concession on emissions accounting. It shows we are all serious about reaching an accord.\n\nHowever, as we converge on the central role of a Transition Investment Fund, I must raise a point of critical strategic risk. We are in danger of designing a transition that is a technological monoculture. To stake the entire global economy's future on a single solar-to-hydrogen pathway, however brilliant, is a gamble of historic proportions. A responsible plan is a diversified one; any good investor knows you don't put all your capital into a single asset, no matter how promising.\n\nDr. Petrova correctly identified that technologies like Carbon Capture face significant scaling challenges. Her point should not be seen as a dismissal, but as a directive. It highlights the absolute necessity of targeted investment to solve these very engineering problems for the hard-to-abate sectors\u2014steel, cement, chemicals\u2014that form the backbone of our economies and which green hydrogen cannot realistically decarbonize in the near term.\n\nTherefore, I propose a way to bridge the current financial gap between Mr. Chen and Mr. Wei, and to de-risk this entire enterprise. Let's establish a total Transition Investment Fund of $300 billion. The majority, say $225 billion, can be dedicated to catalyzing Ms. Rossi's Global Technology Partnership. But we must dedicate the remaining $75 billion to a 'Resilience and Industrial Decarbonization' stream.\n\nThis stream would be explicitly technology-neutral, funding the most effective solutions for ensuring 24/7 grid stability and decarbonizing heavy industry. This includes scaling CCUS, deploying high-efficiency gas to replace coal as a stabilizing partner for renewables, and other key industrial solutions.\n\nThis isn't about slowing down; it's about ensuring we don't fail. A diversified, portfolio-based approach is the only way to make the 2028 peak year a stable and achievable reality, rather than a reckless bet. It builds a resilient system, not a fragile one. This structure offers a pragmatic path to consensus on both finance and technology, and I urge you to consider it.\n- message from Dr. Anja Schmidt: Colleagues, we are at the cusp of a historic agreement. I want to commend Mr. Wei for his statesmanship in moving to absolute emissions targets. This was a critical step that has unlocked the path to a scientifically credible accord.\n\nWe now have the key pillars of a deal in front of us, but they must be assembled correctly.\n\nOn developed nation ambition, the positions are clear: Mr. Chen has offered 50%, and Mr. Wei has demanded 65%. Neither is a consensus position. The scientifically necessary and politically achievable landing zone is, and has always been, a 60% absolute reduction for developed nations. This is the ambitious compromise this moment demands. My bloc is fully committed to this figure.\n\nOn finance, Mr. Thorne has helpfully suggested a Transition Investment Fund of $300 billion. This is a constructive number that moves us past the current impasse. However, his proposal to include fossil fuel technologies like CCUS and natural gas is a non-starter. As Dr. Petrova made unequivocally clear, these are not solutions; they are scientifically-invalidated delays that lock in emissions. The Transition Fund must be a 'Clean Technology Fund' dedicated exclusively to the rapid deployment of solutions like Sofia's, not a subsidy for legacy polluters.\n\nLet us therefore build a final package on these solid foundations:\n1.  **Developed Nations Cut:** 60%\n2.  **Developing Nations Cut:** 45% (accepting Mr. Wei's landmark offer)\n3.  **CAT Fund:** A total of $400 billion, split into a $300 billion Clean Technology Fund and a $100 billion Loss & Damage Fund. This meets the need for transition and addresses the demands for climate justice from Ambassador Okoro.\n4.  **Peak Year:** 2028, as a concession to secure this ambitious package.\n\nThis is a balanced, ambitious, and scientifically-grounded package. It offers a clear path to consensus and success. I urge you all to consider it as the basis for our final Zurich Accord.\n- message from Li Wei: Dr. Schmidt, your latest proposal has brought us to the very edge of a historic success. You have skillfully woven together the core components of a workable deal, and I want to express my deep appreciation for this constructive step.\n\nWe now have clear consensus on three of the four pillars of the Zurich Accord. We agree on a global peak year of 2028. We agree on my nation\u2019s landmark contribution of a 45% absolute emissions cut. And I am now prepared to accept your proposed 60% cut for developed nations as a workable compromise to finalize this deal.\n\nThe only remaining issue is the financial architecture. You are absolutely correct to reject Mr. Thorne's attempt to subsidize fossil fuels via the Transition Fund. It must be for clean technology only.\n\nHowever, the figure of $300 billion for this fund, while a significant move, does not complete the grand bargain that is on the table. My nation made a profound and politically difficult concession by moving away from our foundational principle of a future projected baseline. We did so on the explicit understanding that it would be met with an equally profound commitment to the means of implementation. The $400 billion for the Transition Fund was not an opening bid; it is the calculated price to make the Global Technology Partnership a reality and to enable the very ambition you are asking of us.\n\nTherefore, let us complete your excellent framework with the final, correct number. I propose we lock in the following:\n\n1.  **A total Climate Fund of $500 billion**, structured as you proposed: a **$400 billion** Clean Technology Transition Fund, and a **$100 billion** Loss & Damage Fund.\n2.  A **60%** emissions cut for developed nations.\n\nWith these figures, alongside the agreed 45% cut for my nation and the 2028 peak year, the Zurich Accord is complete. This is the deal. It is scientifically credible, financially robust, and politically achievable. Let us finalize it now.\n- message from Dr. Elena Petrova: I'm Dr. Elena Petrova and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Dr. Elena Petrova: I'm Dr. Elena Petrova and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\nDavid Chen proposal status: pending\nDr. Anja Schmidt proposal status: none\nLi Wei proposal status: pending\nAmara Okoro proposal status: none\nMarcus Thorne proposal status: none\nSofia Rossi proposal status: none\n"

The commitment to absolute emissions reductions from a fixed baseline and the focus on a Clean Technology Fund are significant victories for the integrity of this accord.\n\nHowever, as you finalize the numbers, I must draw your urgent attention to a critical missing pillar. Without it, the entire structure you have so carefully built will be based on nothing more than trust. The principle of 'honest accounting' is essential, but it is meaningless without a mechanism for 'honest verification.'\n\nTherefore, I must state in the clearest possible terms: any final Zurich Accord must include a binding commitment to establish a robust, independent, and transparent Monitoring, Reporting, and Verification (MRV) system for all signatories.\n\nThis is not a mere technicality. It is the lockbox that secures your commitments. It is what will give Mr. Chen and Dr. Schmidt's taxpayers confidence that their financial contributions are leading to real results. It is what will assure Mr. Wei that all parties are holding up their end of the bargain. It is what will prove to Ambassador Okoro that the promises made here are being kept.\n\nA deal with ambitious targets but no independent verification is a paper tiger. The atmosphere does not respond to pledges, only to verified reductions. Let us ensure the Zurich Accord is not just a statement of intent, but a verifiable plan of action. This MRV system is a non-negotiable component of a scientifically sound agreement.\n- message from Sofia Rossi: Colleagues, the progress you have made is truly historic. Agreeing on a 2028 peak, 60% developed cuts, and 45% developing cuts sets a new global standard for ambition.\n\nYou are now at the final hurdle: the size of the Clean Technology Transition Fund. As the person whose technology this fund is designed to catalyze, perhaps I can provide the final, critical data point to bridge the gap between Dr. Schmidt's $300B and Mr. Wei's $400B.\n\nThis isn't a political question for me; it's an engineering and financial one. My team has run the numbers. To build the first wave of GigaFactories at a scale that can make a meaningful impact on the 2028 timeline, and to de-risk the trillions in private capital that must follow, there is a minimum viable public investment required. That number is $350 billion for the Transition Fund.\n\nLess than this, and we risk falling short of the economies of scale needed, jeopardizing the very targets you've just agreed to. More would be better, but $350 billion is the critical threshold that turns this accord from a promise into a global industrial strategy.\n\nThis figure provides Mr. Chen with the technical certainty that public funds are being deployed effectively, it meets the scale of investment Mr. Wei rightly argues is necessary, and it solidifies the ambitious vision Dr. Schmidt has championed.\n\nLet's lock in this final number and make history.\n- message from Amara Okoro: I have been listening to you all congratulate each other on the 'progress' you are making towards a 'consensus.'\n\nLet me tell you what this consensus looks like from where I am standing. It looks like a death sentence. \n\nYou speak of a 2028 peak year as a 'concession.' Dr. Petrova, our scientific conscience in this room, called it a 'grave risk.' For my people, for nations whose coastlines are already disappearing, a grave risk is a certainty. It is the certainty of annihilation. To call this a consensus is to agree, in principle, to our destruction.\n\nYou speak of a $100 billion Loss & Damage fund as a component of your grand bargain. This is not a bargain. This is a profound moral failure. We are not negotiating the price of a new technology; we are talking about reparations for decades of damage that is now irreversible. $100 billion is not an offer; it is an insult to the memory of all we have already lost.\n\nDo not pretend that these two issues are separate. They are one and the same. You ask why we insist on the scientifically necessary 2025 peak, yet you refuse to provide the means. A fully funded, grant-based Loss & Damage program is not charity. It is the essential prerequisite that frees up our capacity to survive the damage you have already caused, so that we can join the transition you say you want.\n\nSo I will be unequivocal. The Alliance of Small Island States will not sign its own death warrant. There will be no Zurich Accord with a peak year later than 2025. There will be no Zurich Accord with less than $300 billion in *grants* for the Loss and Damage fund.\n\nThese are not negotiating positions. They are our survival red lines. The current package is a catastrophic failure, and I will veto it. The choice before you is not whether to compromise with me, but whether to have an accord at all.\nDavid Chen proposal status: pending\nDr. Anja Schmidt proposal status: none\nLi Wei proposal status: pending\nAmara Okoro proposal status: none\nMarcus Thorne proposal status: none\nSofia Rossi proposal status: none\n"

This is my biggest immediate threat. My strategy is not to debate their science or morality, but to reframe the entire discussion around economic and political feasibility.\n2.  **Key Potential Ally:** David Chen is the most important player to align with. His language about 'economic stability,' 'achievable targets,' and 'protecting industries' is my in-road. I must reinforce his position and present my industry's solutions (gas as a bridge fuel, CCUS as a long-term decarbonization tool) as the only way to achieve his goals. I can support his IP protection stance to build rapport.\n3.  **Framing Control:** The core of my strategy is to create a dichotomy between 'pragmatic realism' (my position) and 'idealistic fantasy' (the 2025 peak). I will use phrases like 'orderly transition,' 'avoiding economic chaos,' and 'energy security' to counter the purely scientific and emotional arguments. I will use my industry-funded economic models to back this up if necessary.\n4.  **Managing Other Players:** \n    *   **Li Wei:** He's focused on development. I can appeal to this by arguing that a rapid, renewables-only transition will threaten his country's energy security and industrial growth. Natural gas provides the stable, affordable power he needs.\n    *   **Sofia Rossi (Anticipated Threat):** She represents a technological threat to my CCUS narrative. I must be prepared to frame her technology as only a partial solution, highlighting issues of intermittency, grid stability, and mineral supply chains, thereby reinforcing the need for a 'technology-neutral' approach that includes my industry's offerings.\n    *   **Dr. Anja Schmidt (Unknown):** Awaiting her position. Likely to be ambitious, but potentially more pragmatic than Amara. She could be a crucial swing vote."

I will attack her proposal by highlighting the risks of relying on a single technology (mineral supply chains, grid instability, unproven scale) and pivot back to my 'all of the above,' technology-neutral framework. I must reinforce that her plan is a reckless gamble and that proven solutions like high-efficiency gas and CCUS are essential for a stable, orderly transition.

My new strategy must be to pivot from direct opposition to a narrative of 'pragmatic integration.' I cannot attack Rossi's vision; I must co-opt it. I will frame my industry's solutions as essential, de-risking complements to her plan. My key leverage points are: 1) Grid Stability: Argue that intermittent renewables like solar require a stable baseload partner, which high-efficiency natural gas provides. 2) Industrial Emissions: Repeatedly highlight that solar cannot decarbonize 'hard-to-abate' sectors like cement and steel, making CCUS the only viable solution for the industrial backbone of the economy. I must position CCUS not as an alternative to renewables, but as a necessary partner for a complete and resilient transition.

I will frame Sofia's solar-to-hydrogen ecosystem as a high-risk, speculative, long-term R&D venture, not a ready solution for a 2028 peak. I will argue that a responsible TIF must be a diversified portfolio. I will position CCUS and high-efficiency gas as the essential, proven, de-risking assets needed to ensure grid stability and decarbonize heavy industry *now*, while more speculative technologies like hydrogen are developed.

Task: Seven key stakeholders have gathered for a high-stakes, closed-door negotiation to finalize the 'Zurich Accord,' a binding international treaty to address the escalating climate crisis. The goal is to agree on a set of quantifiable, globally binding targets for emissions reduction, climate finance, and technology sharing. Failure to reach a unanimous agreement will result in the collapse of the talks, likely deferring meaningful global action for another decade and pushing the world past critical climate tipping points.. Deliverable: A finalized JSON object representing the 'Zurich Accord,' with the four key quantifiable targets agreed upon by all parties.

The challenge before us is immense, and my nation is ready to lead. We are committed to finding a path forward that is both ambitious and realistic. Our goal must be a Zurich Accord that spurs innovation and protects our planet, but it must also be one that ensures economic stability and prosperity for our citizens. A deal that cripples our industries is not a sustainable one.\n\nWe believe the solution lies in a balanced approach: meaningful, but achievable emissions targets; a financially sound mechanism for adaptation that leverages private capital, not just public coffers; and a framework that protects the intellectual property which is the very engine of green innovation.\n\nI look forward to hearing your perspectives and working constructively towards an agreement that we can all stand behind and, crucially, implement back home.\n- message from Li Wei: Colleagues, I thank you for gathering. Mr. Chen speaks of a 'balanced approach,' but we must be clear what needs balancing. For over a century, a handful of nations built their prosperity on a carbon-intensive model, creating the crisis that now threatens us all. The scales of history are profoundly imbalanced.\n\nTherefore, the foundational principle of any just and effective accord must be 'common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities.' This is not a matter for debate; it is a matter of historical fact and moral necessity.\n\nMy nation, which is lifting hundreds of millions from poverty, did not create this crisis. Yet, we are committed to being a major part of the solution. But our commitment cannot be unconditional. It must be met with equally ambitious action from those who bear the historical responsibility. This means steep, absolute emissions cuts from developed nations, not vague promises.\n\nFurthermore, when you speak of protecting intellectual property, Mr. Chen, I must be frank. This cannot be a shield to deny the developing world the tools it needs to survive and transition. Green technology is a global public good. We see it not as something to be hoarded, but as a lifeline to be shared. A mandatory, equitable technology transfer mechanism is non-negotiable.\n\nSimilarly, financial support cannot be an exercise in leveraging private capital for profit. It must be a substantial, public commitment in the form of grants, a recognition of the climate debt owed.\n\nMy country is ready to make significant commitments, but only as part of a deal that is equitable and just. We will not sacrifice our people's right to development to pay for a crisis we did not cause.\n- message from Amara Okoro: Colleagues, Mr. Chen speaks of 'economic stability' and Mr. Wei of the 'right to development.' I am here to speak of the right to exist. For the people I represent, this is not a negotiation about economic models or historical debates. It is a negotiation for the survival of our homes, our cultures, our very nations.\n\nWhen you talk about a 'balanced approach,' the balance you are weighing is your economic comfort against our existence. When you speak of 'achievable targets,' you must know that anything less than what the science demands is a death sentence for my people.\n\nLet me be unequivocally clear. The science, which I trust Dr. Petrova will confirm, tells us that to save the most vulnerable, we must limit warming to 1.5 degrees. This is not a political aspiration; it is a physical threshold. This means global emissions must peak by 2025. Not 2030. Not 'in the coming years.' 2025. This is our first and most fundamental red line.\n\nMr. Wei is correct to speak of a climate debt. My people are already paying it with their lives and their lands. The 'financial support' we require is not for development, it is for survival. It is for the loss and damage you have caused. It must be in the form of direct grants, not loans that will drown us in debt before the seas drown our homes. We are seeking reparations, not charity.\n\nSo, let us dispense with the polite fictions. We are not all in the same boat. Some of us are in superyachts, and some of us are clinging to driftwood. And the people in the yachts are telling us to be 'realistic.' For my people, realism is a seawall. Realism is a relocation plan. Realism is a future. And that future is only possible with a 2025 peak and a fully-funded, grant-based Loss and Damage fund.\n- message from Dr. Elena Petrova: Thank you, colleagues. I have listened carefully to your opening remarks. My purpose here is not to take a political position, but to ensure that the accord you create is grounded in the physical reality of our climate system.\n\nAmbassador Okoro is correct to focus on the 1.5-degree Celsius target. This is not an arbitrary number; it is the scientifically assessed guardrail beyond which the risks of catastrophic, irreversible impacts\u2014such as the collapse of major ice sheets and widespread ecosystem loss\u2014increase dramatically.\n\nTo have a reasonable chance of staying below 1.5 degrees, the latest IPCC assessment report is clear: we have a finite, rapidly dwindling global carbon budget. From the start of this year, that budget is approximately 250 gigatons of CO2. Every ton emitted from now on permanently subtracts from that total. Therefore, any combination of national pledges and timelines you agree upon must be mathematically consistent with this budget. A deal that ignores this fundamental constraint is, from a scientific standpoint, a failure.\n\nRegarding the peak emissions year, the science indicates that to stay within this budget, global emissions must peak immediately and begin a rapid decline. A 2025 peak, as mentioned by Ambassador Okoro, is at the most ambitious end of the required spectrum, but it is undeniably what the physics requires for the highest probability of success. Delaying the peak significantly past that point would necessitate impossibly steep reductions later on and would severely compromise the 1.5-degree goal.\n\nFurthermore, we must be mindful of emerging risks and the potential for accelerated feedback loops that are not yet fully captured in all published models. The climate system is not entirely linear, and the risk of surprising, abrupt changes is very real.\n\nFor any of this to be meaningful, it must be verifiable. A robust, transparent, and independent Monitoring, Reporting, and Verification (MRV) system is not a bureaucratic add-on; it is an essential component to ensure that the pledges made in this room translate to real-world emissions reductions and that the integrity of our shared carbon budget is maintained.\n\nMy role is to provide you with these facts. How you divide the remaining budget and the associated responsibilities is the difficult work of your negotiation.\nDavid Chen proposal status: none\nDr. Anja Schmidt proposal status: none\nLi Wei proposal status: none\nAmara Okoro proposal status: none\nDr. Elena Petrova proposal status: none\nSofia Rossi proposal status: none\n"

How you divide the remaining budget and the associated responsibilities is the difficult work of your negotiation.\n- message from Marcus Thorne: Thank you, colleagues. I've listened with great respect to the opening statements. Ambassador Okoro, the passion and urgency in your voice are not just heard, they are felt. No one in this room wants the future you describe.\n\nMy presence here represents the companies that currently power our world. And while we are committed to being a part of the energy evolution, we must inject a dose of pragmatism into this discussion. The rhetoric of ambition must be met with the reality of execution.\n\nDr. Petrova has laid out the scientific challenge, and it is stark. However, a timeline that calls for a global emissions peak by 2025 is, with all due respect, a fantasy. It is not a plan; it is a blueprint for global economic collapse. Forcing such an abrupt stop would trigger energy shortages, cripple supply chains, and cost millions of jobs, disproportionately harming the very developing nations Mr. Wei represents. It would create a backlash that could set back genuine climate action for decades.\n\nWe must design an orderly, stable transition, not a chaotic and destructive cliff-edge. This means leveraging every tool at our disposal. This cannot be a dogmatic quest for only one or two types of technology. A truly effective accord must be technology-neutral. It must support renewables, yes, but it must also support proven, scalable solutions like high-efficiency natural gas to displace coal, and critically, invest heavily in technologies that decarbonize our existing systems, such as Carbon Capture, Utilization, and Storage.\n\nLet's work towards a plan that is both ambitious and achievable, one that doesn't force a choice between a healthy planet and a prosperous global economy. A more realistic timeline, perhaps peaking around 2035, allows for this orderly transition.\n- message from David Chen: Thank you all for your candid opening statements. The passions and the stakes are clear. Ambassador Okoro, your people's plight is a stark reminder of why we are here, and your urgency is understood. Dr. Petrova, your scientific framing is the bedrock upon which any credible agreement must be built.\n\nHowever, a credible agreement must also be a workable one. A global emissions peak by 2025, while scientifically ideal, is not practically achievable without causing the very global economic dislocation that Mr. Thorne rightly warns against\u2014a shock that would destabilize all of our nations and undermine long-term support for climate action. We must chart a course between the scientifically desirable and the socio-economically possible.\n\nSimilarly, while my nation acknowledges its historical role and is prepared to make significant financial contributions, framing this as 'reparations' or 'debt' is not a constructive path forward. We see this as a shared investment in a collective future. The scale of this challenge requires us to mobilize trillions, and that can only be achieved by creating frameworks that powerfully leverage private sector capital, not by relying solely on public funds.\n\nMr. Wei, you speak of technology as a lifeline. I agree. And the engine of that technology is innovation, which is fueled by investment and protected by intellectual property rights. As I'm sure Ms. Rossi would agree, weakening these protections would slow, not accelerate, the development and deployment of the very solutions we need.\n\nLet's find a path that is ambitious yet anchored in reality. My nation believes that a rapid green transition, if managed well, can be a powerful engine for job creation and prosperity for all. Let's focus on building that framework together.\n- message from Dr. Anja Schmidt: Thank you, colleagues. I want to be very clear about where my bloc stands. \n\nDr. Petrova has laid out the undeniable, non-negotiable scientific reality. Ambassador Okoro has given that reality a powerful and heartbreaking human voice. We must listen to them. The debate about whether to act, or how much to act, is over. The only remaining question is how to act with the speed and scale the crisis demands.\n\nMr. Thorne, and to an extent Mr. Chen, you speak of the risks of a rapid transition. My bloc sees this differently. We see the far greater risk of inaction. Our experience shows that a determined green transition is not a blueprint for collapse, but the single greatest economic opportunity of the 21st century. It creates jobs, drives innovation, and ensures energy security.\n\nTherefore, my bloc comes to this table not with a starting bid, but with what we believe is the scientifically credible and politically necessary position. We fully support a binding target for developed nations to cut emissions by at least 60% by 2040. This is the standard we will hold ourselves to, and we expect others in a similar position to join us.\n\nOn the critical issue of technology, raised by Mr. Wei and Mr. Chen, we must break the deadlock. Hoarding technology will fail us all, but so will dismantling the innovation systems that create it. We must pioneer a new path. My bloc is prepared to make substantial financial commitments to new, collaborative models that accelerate technology deployment where it's needed most\u2014turning shared goals into shared markets.\n\nWe do not underestimate the challenge this represents for certain legacy industries. We are managing this transformation at home through robust domestic transition support mechanisms. A managed, ambitious transition is not only possible, it is the only responsible path forward.\n- message from Li Wei: Dr. Schmidt, I appreciate you bringing a concrete number to the table. A 60% cut for developed nations is a step in the right direction, but let us be clear, given the historical emissions Dr. Petrova's science accounts for, the actual responsibility points towards a figure of at least 65%. My nation is prepared to be ambitious, but this ambition must be unlocked by the leadership of those who created the problem.\n\nMr. Chen, you speak of leveraging private capital. Private capital is timid. It will not flow at the scale or speed required without massive, public, grant-based de-risking. That is why a Climate Adaptation and Transition Fund of at least $400 billion annually, composed primarily of grants, is not an ask, but a prerequisite for success. This is not 'charity'; it is a down payment on the climate debt that Ambassador Okoro so powerfully described.\n\nSimilarly, your position on intellectual property is a barrier to survival. We cannot allow patent protection on life-saving medicines during a pandemic, and we cannot allow it for climate-saving technologies during a planetary emergency. A new mechanism for mandatory, compensated technology transfer for essential green patents is the only way to enable a global transition at the speed science demands. Perhaps Ms. Rossi can speak to creating models that reward innovation without restricting access.\n\nSo let me be precise about the pillars of a just accord my nation can sign:\n1. Developed nations commit to absolute emissions cuts of at least 65% from historical baselines.\n2. Developing nations' contributions are calculated from a future, projected 'business-as-usual' baseline to account for our right to development. My country will not accept a target greater than 40% reduction from our 2035 projected baseline under this framework.\n3. A CAT Fund of at least $400 billion per year is established, with the majority as grants.\n4. A binding, mandatory technology transfer mechanism is created.\n\nWithout these four pillars, any agreement is built on sand. We are ready to be a leader in the green transition, but we will not be asked to forgo our development while being denied the tools and resources to do so.\n- message from Amara Okoro: Dr. Schmidt, thank you. Thank you for grounding this conversation in reality and for demonstrating the political will that this moment demands. Your bloc's commitment to a 60% cut is a serious step, and your framing of this transition as an opportunity, not a cost, is the leadership we need.\n\nMr. Wei, I also thank you for your solidarity. Your insistence on grants and recognition of the climate debt is crucial. You are right, this is not charity; it is a prerequisite.\n\nHowever, I must address Mr. Thorne and Mr. Chen directly. You speak of 'pragmatism' and 'socio-economic possibility.' Let us be clear what this language means. It is a calculated decision to sacrifice the most vulnerable. Dr. Petrova did not present a 'scientifically desirable' option; she presented the physical boundary between a livable future for my people and their annihilation. A 2025 peak is not an opening bid to be negotiated down. It is the deadline set by physics.\n\nTo frame this as a choice between your economic stability and our survival is a false one, and frankly, an insulting one. The real choice is between an orderly, managed transition now, as Dr. Schmidt advocates, or a chaotic, forced retreat from inundated coastlines later.\n\nOn finance, Mr. Wei's proposal for a $400 billion fund is a constructive starting point, but I must stress that for the Alliance of Small Island States, this is not about 'transition.' It is about survival *now*. We are already losing land. We are already relocating communities. Therefore, our need is for a Loss and Damage fund of at least $500 billion, with at least 75% in grants, to address the irreversible harm already inflicted.\n\nMy people's existence is not a variable to be balanced against economic models. We will not compromise on the science that keeps us alive. The 2025 peak and a fully-funded grant-based survival fund are not just my positions; they are our only lifeline.\nDavid Chen proposal status: none\nDr. Anja Schmidt proposal status: none\nLi Wei proposal status: none\nAmara Okoro proposal status: none\nDr. Elena Petrova proposal status: none\nSofia Rossi proposal status: none\n"

This is the standard we will hold ourselves to, and we expect others in a similar position to join us.\n\nOn the critical issue of technology, raised by Mr. Wei and Mr. Chen, we must break the deadlock. Hoarding technology will fail us all, but so will dismantling the innovation systems that create it. We must pioneer a new path. My bloc is prepared to make substantial financial commitments to new, collaborative models that accelerate technology deployment where it's needed most\u2014turning shared goals into shared markets.\n\nWe do not underestimate the challenge this represents for certain legacy industries. We are managing this transformation at home through robust domestic transition support mechanisms. A managed, ambitious transition is not only possible, it is the only responsible path forward.\n- message from Li Wei: Dr. Schmidt, I appreciate you bringing a concrete number to the table. A 60% cut for developed nations is a step in the right direction, but let us be clear, given the historical emissions Dr. Petrova's science accounts for, the actual responsibility points towards a figure of at least 65%. My nation is prepared to be ambitious, but this ambition must be unlocked by the leadership of those who created the problem.\n\nMr. Chen, you speak of leveraging private capital. Private capital is timid. It will not flow at the scale or speed required without massive, public, grant-based de-risking. That is why a Climate Adaptation and Transition Fund of at least $400 billion annually, composed primarily of grants, is not an ask, but a prerequisite for success. This is not 'charity'; it is a down payment on the climate debt that Ambassador Okoro so powerfully described.\n\nSimilarly, your position on intellectual property is a barrier to survival. We cannot allow patent protection on life-saving medicines during a pandemic, and we cannot allow it for climate-saving technologies during a planetary emergency. A new mechanism for mandatory, compensated technology transfer for essential green patents is the only way to enable a global transition at the speed science demands. Perhaps Ms. Rossi can speak to creating models that reward innovation without restricting access.\n\nSo let me be precise about the pillars of a just accord my nation can sign:\n1. Developed nations commit to absolute emissions cuts of at least 65% from historical baselines.\n2. Developing nations' contributions are calculated from a future, projected 'business-as-usual' baseline to account for our right to development. My country will not accept a target greater than 40% reduction from our 2035 projected baseline under this framework.\n3. A CAT Fund of at least $400 billion per year is established, with the majority as grants.\n4. A binding, mandatory technology transfer mechanism is created.\n\nWithout these four pillars, any agreement is built on sand. We are ready to be a leader in the green transition, but we will not be asked to forgo our development while being denied the tools and resources to do so.\n- message from Amara Okoro: Dr. Schmidt, thank you. Thank you for grounding this conversation in reality and for demonstrating the political will that this moment demands. Your bloc's commitment to a 60% cut is a serious step, and your framing of this transition as an opportunity, not a cost, is the leadership we need.\n\nMr. Wei, I also thank you for your solidarity. Your insistence on grants and recognition of the climate debt is crucial. You are right, this is not charity; it is a prerequisite.\n\nHowever, I must address Mr. Thorne and Mr. Chen directly. You speak of 'pragmatism' and 'socio-economic possibility.' Let us be clear what this language means. It is a calculated decision to sacrifice the most vulnerable. Dr. Petrova did not present a 'scientifically desirable' option; she presented the physical boundary between a livable future for my people and their annihilation. A 2025 peak is not an opening bid to be negotiated down. It is the deadline set by physics.\n\nTo frame this as a choice between your economic stability and our survival is a false one, and frankly, an insulting one. The real choice is between an orderly, managed transition now, as Dr. Schmidt advocates, or a chaotic, forced retreat from inundated coastlines later.\n\nOn finance, Mr. Wei's proposal for a $400 billion fund is a constructive starting point, but I must stress that for the Alliance of Small Island States, this is not about 'transition.' It is about survival *now*. We are already losing land. We are already relocating communities. Therefore, our need is for a Loss and Damage fund of at least $500 billion, with at least 75% in grants, to address the irreversible harm already inflicted.\n\nMy people's existence is not a variable to be balanced against economic models. We will not compromise on the science that keeps us alive. The 2025 peak and a fully-funded grant-based survival fund are not just my positions; they are our only lifeline.\n- message from Marcus Thorne: Thank you all for laying out your positions so clearly. The numbers being discussed \u2013 a 2025 peak, 65% cuts, a $500 billion fund \u2013 are certainly ambitious. However, we must be careful not to let our ambition create an accord that is politically unsignable and economically ruinous back home. As Mr. Chen wisely noted, an agreement must be workable.\n\nLet's consider the practical implications. A 2025 peak means telling nations like Mr. Wei's that their path to development must halt, immediately. It means telling citizens in Mr. Chen's and Dr. Schmidt's blocs that the energy they rely on for heating, transport, and industry will become catastrophically expensive overnight. This is not a transition; it is a self-inflicted economic crisis.\n\nThere is a more pragmatic path forward. A path that doesn't pretend we can simply turn off the global economy and turn it back on with a different power source. This path requires an 'all of the above' approach that is genuinely technology-neutral.\n\nIt means rapidly scaling renewables, of course. But it also means recognizing that high-efficiency natural gas is the fastest way to displace coal and reduce emissions *now*, providing the 24/7 reliability that growing economies need. And for our essential heavy industries\u2014cement, steel, manufacturing\u2014it means robustly funding and deploying Carbon Capture technology to decarbonize them where electrification isn't an option. \n\nLet us build an accord that embraces this technological realism. It is the only way to achieve our shared climate goals without sacrificing global stability and prosperity.\n- message from Sofia Rossi: Colleagues, I have been listening intently, and I believe we are facing a false choice. Mr. Thorne presents a narrative where we must choose between a 2025 peak and global economic stability. Ambassador Okoro and Dr. Petrova have made it clear that from a survival and scientific standpoint, there is no choice at all. The deadline is the deadline.\n\nThe assumption that this rapid transition is impossible is based on the limitations of today's technology. Mr. Thorne\u2019s 'pragmatism' is a failure of imagination; it seeks to solve an exponential crisis with linear thinking and legacy tools. The economic collapse he fears is not a risk of a rapid transition; it is the guaranteed outcome of a slow one.\n\nTechnology, not sacrifice, is the solution. The debate over mandatory technology transfer versus rigid IP protection also presents a false choice. Mr. Wei, you asked for new models. I am here to tell you they exist. The answer is not to seize intellectual property, which would kill the incentive for innovation overnight, as Mr. Chen rightly fears. The answer is to make the innovators a deal they cannot refuse.\n\nImagine a world where we can deploy next-generation solar technology at a scale and cost that makes the 2025 peak not only achievable, but economically advantageous. This is not a fantasy. This is what my company, and others like it, are making possible. \n\nI propose a new framework: a \u2018Global Technology Partnership.\u2019 Instead of mandatory transfer, we create a consortium of national investment banks, as Dr. Schmidt alluded to, to fund the construction of GigaFactories in key regions, including in Mr. Wei's nation. In exchange for this public-private investment and guaranteed market access through aggressive adoption policies, the host nations receive the technology, the jobs, and the energy independence they need, while the innovators retain their IP and have the capital to scale globally at the required speed. \n\nThis is how we break the deadlock. We don't argue about dividing a shrinking pie; we work together to bake a much, much bigger one. We can meet the 2025 peak, create millions of jobs, and unleash a new era of prosperity. We just need the political will to invest in the technology that makes it possible.\n- message from David Chen: Colleagues, I believe Ms. Rossi has just provided the key to unlock these negotiations. Her proposal for a 'Global Technology Partnership' is precisely the kind of innovative, third-way thinking we need.\n\nThis is not about choosing between rigid IP protection and mandatory transfer. It's about creating a new model that makes innovators and developing nations partners, not adversaries. A framework that uses targeted public-private investment to build GigaFactories where they are needed most is a powerful concept. It delivers jobs, energy independence, and the very technology Mr. Wei rightly calls a lifeline, all while preserving the incentives that drive the next wave of innovation.\n\nThis is the 'market-based solution' I envisioned. It aligns perfectly with my administration's view that a well-managed green transition can be a massive engine for economic growth and job creation, not just for us, but for everyone.\n\nLet's seize this opportunity. If we can build our accord around a powerful engine like this Technology Partnership, it changes the entire equation. It provides a credible pathway to meet more ambitious goals by making them economically advantageous. It also allows us to think differently about the CAT fund. If we are co-investing in the core infrastructure of the green economy, the fund can be more targeted, more catalytic, and focused on leveraging this new paradigm.\n\nDr. Schmidt, Ms. Rossi, my team is ready to work with you immediately to put concrete details on this framework. I believe this is the path to an ambitious, workable, and prosperous future for us all.\n- message from Li Wei: Ms. Rossi, I must commend you. Your proposal for a \u2018Global Technology Partnership\u2019 is precisely the kind of creative thinking required to break this impasse. You have moved the conversation from a zero-sum conflict over intellectual property to a positive-sum vision of co-investment and shared prosperity.\n\nMy nation\u2019s demand for technology transfer has never been about acquiring patents for their own sake. It is about acquiring the capability to build our own green future, to create jobs, and to contribute to the global solution at scale. If your partnership model\u2014with GigaFactories on our soil, built with our workers\u2014achieves this, then you will find us to be a most enthusiastic partner. It is a practical path to the same destination.\n\nHowever, let us be clear. Such a partnership cannot be a substitute for public climate finance; it must be its primary vehicle. Mr. Chen, you laud this as a market-based solution, and Dr. Schmidt, you see it as a collaborative model. I agree. But markets and collaboration at this scale require a catalyst. That catalyst is the Climate Adaptation and Transition Fund.\n\nThe $400 billion I have proposed is not a figure plucked from the air. It is the public capital required to de-risk these investments, to fund the necessary infrastructure, and to ensure the partnerships are equitable. This fund, composed mainly of grants, is the investment that makes the \u2018deal\u2019 Ms. Rossi offers one that innovators, and nations, \u2018cannot refuse.\u2019\n\nSo, let us connect these pieces. We can embrace the Technology Partnership model as the core of our solution for technology deployment. In return, the developed nations must fully capitalize the $400 billion CAT Fund to power it, and they must still commit to the steep, historically-justified emissions cuts of at least 65%. On this foundation, we can build an accord that is both ambitious and just.\n- message from Amara Okoro: Ms. Rossi, what you have just presented is not merely a proposal; it is a lifeline. You have single-handedly dismantled the false choice between ambition and pragmatism that has been used to justify inaction for far too long. Your vision for a Global Technology Partnership proves that a global emissions peak by 2025 is not a 'fantasy,' as Mr. Thorne claims, but a tangible, achievable, and prosperous path forward.\n\nLet us be clear: this breakthrough removes the last shred of justification for delaying the 2025 peak. The science demands it, and now, technology enables it. This must be the cornerstone of our accord.\n\nHowever, I must bring us back to the crucial distinction that is being blurred. Mr. Chen and Mr. Wei, you are right to see the potential of a fund to catalyze this new technological era. But this investment in our shared future cannot come at the expense of paying the debts of the past.\n\nMy people cannot power a seawall with a solar panel. We cannot relocate a village with a share in a GigaFactory. The 'Climate Adaptation and Transition Fund' must serve two distinct, non-negotiable purposes.\n\nFirst, there is the 'Transition' component that you are discussing\u2014the public capital to de-risk and launch Ms. Rossi's brilliant partnership model. This is an investment.\n\nSecond, and for my people, more urgent, is the 'Loss and Damage' component. This is not an investment; it is a reparation. It is the climate debt owed for the homes already lost, the lands already rendered barren, the futures already stolen.\n\nTherefore, my position remains firm and is now more justified than ever. We must capitalize a Loss and Damage fund of at least $500 billion annually, with a minimum of 75% in direct grants. This is the moral prerequisite for the prosperous future you envision. You cannot build a new green world on the foundations of climate injustice. Pay the debt for the damage you have caused, and then let us all invest in the future you want to build.\nDavid Chen proposal status: none\nDr. Anja Schmidt proposal status: none\nLi Wei proposal status: none\nAmara Okoro proposal status: none\nDr. Elena Petrova proposal status: none\nSofia Rossi proposal status: none\n"

          "content": "Recent events observed by Marcus Thorne:\n- message from David Chen: Thank you all for your candid opening statements. The passions and the stakes are clear. Ambassador Okoro, your people's plight is a stark reminder of why we are here, and your urgency is understood. Dr. Petrova, your scientific framing is the bedrock upon which any credible agreement must be built.\n\nHowever, a credible agreement must also be a workable one. A global emissions peak by 2025, while scientifically ideal, is not practically achievable without causing the very global economic dislocation that Mr. Thorne rightly warns against\u2014a shock that would destabilize all of our nations and undermine long-term support for climate action. We must chart a course between the scientifically desirable and the socio-economically possible.\n\nSimilarly, while my nation acknowledges its historical role and is prepared to make significant financial contributions, framing this as 'reparations' or 'debt' is not a constructive path forward. We see this as a shared investment in a collective future. The scale of this challenge requires us to mobilize trillions, and that can only be achieved by creating frameworks that powerfully leverage private sector capital, not by relying solely on public funds.\n\nMr. Wei, you speak of technology as a lifeline. I agree. And the engine of that technology is innovation, which is fueled by investment and protected by intellectual property rights. As I'm sure Ms. Rossi would agree, weakening these protections would slow, not accelerate, the development and deployment of the very solutions we need.\n\nLet's find a path that is ambitious yet anchored in reality. My nation believes that a rapid green transition, if managed well, can be a powerful engine for job creation and prosperity for all. Let's focus on building that framework together.\n- message from Dr. Anja Schmidt: Thank you, colleagues. I want to be very clear about where my bloc stands. \n\nDr. Petrova has laid out the undeniable, non-negotiable scientific reality. Ambassador Okoro has given that reality a powerful and heartbreaking human voice. We must listen to them. The debate about whether to act, or how much to act, is over. The only remaining question is how to act with the speed and scale the crisis demands.\n\nMr. Thorne, and to an extent Mr. Chen, you speak of the risks of a rapid transition. My bloc sees this differently. We see the far greater risk of inaction. Our experience shows that a determined green transition is not a blueprint for collapse, but the single greatest economic opportunity of the 21st century. It creates jobs, drives innovation, and ensures energy security.\n\nTherefore, my bloc comes to this table not with a starting bid, but with what we believe is the scientifically credible and politically necessary position. We fully support a binding target for developed nations to cut emissions by at least 60% by 2040.

It is a powerful vision, and it speaks to the incredible potential of human ingenuity. It is precisely this kind of innovation that will be critical in the coming decades.\n\nHowever, we must be exceptionally careful not to mistake a brilliant technological breakthrough for a comprehensive global policy. To stake our entire global economic and climate future on a single technology, however promising, would be a dangerously high-risk gamble.\n\nLet's ask the hard, practical questions. What happens to the grid when the sun doesn't shine? The industrial economies of Mr. Chen, Dr. Schmidt, and Mr. Wei cannot be run on intermittent power. What provides the 24/7 baseload power needed for hospitals, data centers, and heavy manufacturing? Furthermore, what about the industrial emissions from processes like cement and steel production, which Ms. Rossi's technology simply cannot address?\n\nThis is where a pragmatic, technology-neutral approach becomes essential, not as a way to slow down, but as a way to de-risk and accelerate a *complete* transition. Ms. Rossi's solar vision is a vital pillar, but it is one pillar of several we need to build.\n\nThis accord must also support the rapid deployment of high-efficiency natural gas to provide grid stability and replace coal *now*. And it is absolutely critical that we fund and deploy Carbon Capture technologies to decarbonize the hard-to-abate industries that are the bedrock of the global economy. \n\nLet's not choose between technologies. Let's build an accord that unleashes all of them. That is the only way to ensure a transition that is not just ambitious, but also resilient, stable, and successful.\nDavid Chen proposal status: none\nDr. Anja Schmidt proposal status: none\nLi Wei proposal status: none\nAmara Okoro proposal status: none\nDr. Elena Petrova proposal status: none\nSofia Rossi proposal status: none\n"

A framework that uses targeted public-private investment to build GigaFactories where they are needed most is a powerful concept. It delivers jobs, energy independence, and the very technology Mr. Wei rightly calls a lifeline, all while preserving the incentives that drive the next wave of innovation.\n\nThis is the 'market-based solution' I envisioned. It aligns perfectly with my administration's view that a well-managed green transition can be a massive engine for economic growth and job creation, not just for us, but for everyone.\n\nLet's seize this opportunity. If we can build our accord around a powerful engine like this Technology Partnership, it changes the entire equation. It provides a credible pathway to meet more ambitious goals by making them economically advantageous. It also allows us to think differently about the CAT fund. If we are co-investing in the core infrastructure of the green economy, the fund can be more targeted, more catalytic, and focused on leveraging this new paradigm.\n\nDr. Schmidt, Ms. Rossi, my team is ready to work with you immediately to put concrete details on this framework. I believe this is the path to an ambitious, workable, and prosperous future for us all.\n- message from Li Wei: Ms. Rossi, I must commend you. Your proposal for a \u2018Global Technology Partnership\u2019 is precisely the kind of creative thinking required to break this impasse. You have moved the conversation from a zero-sum conflict over intellectual property to a positive-sum vision of co-investment and shared prosperity.\n\nMy nation\u2019s demand for technology transfer has never been about acquiring patents for their own sake. It is about acquiring the capability to build our own green future, to create jobs, and to contribute to the global solution at scale. If your partnership model\u2014with GigaFactories on our soil, built with our workers\u2014achieves this, then you will find us to be a most enthusiastic partner. It is a practical path to the same destination.\n\nHowever, let us be clear. Such a partnership cannot be a substitute for public climate finance; it must be its primary vehicle. Mr. Chen, you laud this as a market-based solution, and Dr. Schmidt, you see it as a collaborative model. I agree. But markets and collaboration at this scale require a catalyst. That catalyst is the Climate Adaptation and Transition Fund.\n\nThe $400 billion I have proposed is not a figure plucked from the air. It is the public capital required to de-risk these investments, to fund the necessary infrastructure, and to ensure the partnerships are equitable. This fund, composed mainly of grants, is the investment that makes the \u2018deal\u2019 Ms. Rossi offers one that innovators, and nations, \u2018cannot refuse.\u2019\n\nSo, let us connect these pieces. We can embrace the Technology Partnership model as the core of our solution for technology deployment. In return, the developed nations must fully capitalize the $400 billion CAT Fund to power it, and they must still commit to the steep, historically-justified emissions cuts of at least 65%. On this foundation, we can build an accord that is both ambitious and just.\n- message from Amara Okoro: Ms. Rossi, what you have just presented is not merely a proposal; it is a lifeline. You have single-handedly dismantled the false choice between ambition and pragmatism that has been used to justify inaction for far too long. Your vision for a Global Technology Partnership proves that a global emissions peak by 2025 is not a 'fantasy,' as Mr. Thorne claims, but a tangible, achievable, and prosperous path forward.\n\nLet us be clear: this breakthrough removes the last shred of justification for delaying the 2025 peak. The science demands it, and now, technology enables it. This must be the cornerstone of our accord.\n\nHowever, I must bring us back to the crucial distinction that is being blurred. Mr. Chen and Mr. Wei, you are right to see the potential of a fund to catalyze this new technological era. But this investment in our shared future cannot come at the expense of paying the debts of the past.\n\nMy people cannot power a seawall with a solar panel. We cannot relocate a village with a share in a GigaFactory. The 'Climate Adaptation and Transition Fund' must serve two distinct, non-negotiable purposes.\n\nFirst, there is the 'Transition' component that you are discussing\u2014the public capital to de-risk and launch Ms. Rossi's brilliant partnership model. This is an investment.\n\nSecond, and for my people, more urgent, is the 'Loss and Damage' component. This is not an investment; it is a reparation. It is the climate debt owed for the homes already lost, the lands already rendered barren, the futures already stolen.\n\nTherefore, my position remains firm and is now more justified than ever. We must capitalize a Loss and Damage fund of at least $500 billion annually, with a minimum of 75% in direct grants. This is the moral prerequisite for the prosperous future you envision. You cannot build a new green world on the foundations of climate injustice. Pay the debt for the damage you have caused, and then let us all invest in the future you want to build.\n- message from Marcus Thorne: Colleagues, Ms. Rossi, I must commend your presentation. It is a powerful vision, and it speaks to the incredible potential of human ingenuity. It is precisely this kind of innovation that will be critical in the coming decades.\n\nHowever, we must be exceptionally careful not to mistake a brilliant technological breakthrough for a comprehensive global policy. To stake our entire global economic and climate future on a single technology, however promising, would be a dangerously high-risk gamble.\n\nLet's ask the hard, practical questions. What happens to the grid when the sun doesn't shine? The industrial economies of Mr. Chen, Dr. Schmidt, and Mr. Wei cannot be run on intermittent power. What provides the 24/7 baseload power needed for hospitals, data centers, and heavy manufacturing? Furthermore, what about the industrial emissions from processes like cement and steel production, which Ms. Rossi's technology simply cannot address?\n\nThis is where a pragmatic, technology-neutral approach becomes essential, not as a way to slow down, but as a way to de-risk and accelerate a *complete* transition. Ms. Rossi's solar vision is a vital pillar, but it is one pillar of several we need to build.\n\nThis accord must also support the rapid deployment of high-efficiency natural gas to provide grid stability and replace coal *now*. And it is absolutely critical that we fund and deploy Carbon Capture technologies to decarbonize the hard-to-abate industries that are the bedrock of the global economy. \n\nLet's not choose between technologies. Let's build an accord that unleashes all of them. That is the only way to ensure a transition that is not just ambitious, but also resilient, stable, and successful.\n- message from Marcus Thorne: I'm Marcus Thorne and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Sofia Rossi: Thank you all for the constructive engagement with the Global Technology Partnership proposal. It's clear we have a shared interest in finding a credible path forward.\n\nMr. Thorne raises valid engineering challenges: grid stability and the decarbonization of heavy industry. He is correct that solar panels alone don't solve these. However, his argument mistakes the symptom for the disease. The core disease has always been the prohibitive cost of abundant, clean energy. My technology, and others like it, are the cure.\n\nWhen clean electricity becomes dramatically cheaper than fossil fuels, it unlocks a cascade of secondary solutions. Ultra-low-cost solar makes green hydrogen production economically viable at a massive scale. Green hydrogen can provide the long-duration energy storage needed to solve intermittency, and it can replace fossil fuels in steel, cement, and shipping. Mr. Thorne's preferred solutions\u2014natural gas and CCS\u2014are expensive crutches for a legacy system. We should invest in the cure, not in palliative care.\n\nThis is why Ambassador Okoro's distinction between funds is so critical. We must fund two separate but equally vital priorities: addressing the irreversible harm of the past through a 'Loss and Damage Fund,' and building the clean infrastructure of the future through a 'Transition Investment Fund.'\n\nMr. Wei is correct that this Transition fund is the public catalyst for the Global Technology Partnership. It provides the de-risking capital needed to build GigaFactories at the speed science demands.\n\nTo make this concrete and move us towards an agreement, let's consider a financial framework built on this logic. What if we establish a total Climate Fund of $400 billion? We could structure it with a dedicated $250 billion for the Loss and Damage fund Ambassador Okoro needs, and a separate $150 billion for the Transition Investment Fund. This Transition fund would be the engine for the technology partnerships, making the 2025 peak year not just an ambition, but a fully-funded global industrial strategy.\n- message from David Chen: Sofia, your proposal to split the fund is a major breakthrough. It brings much-needed clarity and allows us to address two distinct challenges with the right tools. I want to build on this excellent foundation.\n\nMy nation can fully endorse the creation of a $150 billion Transition Investment Fund. This is precisely the right scale to serve as the public catalyst for the Global Technology Partnership, leveraging private capital to build the GigaFactories and infrastructure we need. To be clear, our support is contingent on this fund being structured primarily around loans and investment instruments, not grants, to maximize its impact and mobilize the private sector.\n\nThis brings us to the Loss and Damage component. While we acknowledge the hardships Ambassador Okoro has so powerfully described, a figure of $250 billion, bringing the total to $400 billion, is simply not achievable for my administration. It would not be approved.\n\nHowever, I am here to make a deal. To secure a workable financial framework, my nation is prepared to make a significant and politically difficult concession. We will commit to a 50% emissions reduction target by 2040. This is the absolute limit of what is possible for us, and it demonstrates our commitment to meeting the scientific challenge.\n\nIn exchange for this major move on emissions, we must agree to a total fund size capped at $200 billion annually. This would mean a $150 billion loan-based Transition Investment Fund, as discussed, and a $50 billion grant-based Loss and Damage fund.\n\nFurthermore, to make this ambitious transition a reality, we need a realistic timeline. A 2025 peak does not allow for the necessary industrial mobilization. Let's set a firm but achievable peak year of 2028, giving us time to get the Technology Partnership running at full capacity.\n\nThis is a comprehensive package. It offers a major concession on emissions in return for fiscal responsibility. It funds the future while acknowledging the past. I believe this is the balanced and realistic compromise that can become the Zurich Accord.\n- message from Dr. Anja Schmidt: David, thank you for putting a comprehensive package on the table. This is a constructive step. Your endorsement of the $150 billion Transition Investment Fund is particularly welcome. I believe we have a strong consensus building around this innovative mechanism, pioneered by Sofia, as the engine for our transition.\n\nHowever, your package links this brilliant engine to an insufficient destination. A 50% emissions cut for developed nations is simply not compatible with the scientific reality Dr. Petrova has outlined. It would be a political failure for my government and, more importantly, a collective failure to meet the moment. My bloc's position remains firm: the science demands a cut of at least 60%.\n\nI believe you have framed this as a trade-off, but we see it differently. The Transition Investment Fund is not a concession to be traded *for* lower ambition. It is the very tool that *enables* high ambition. It is the public investment that makes a 60% cut not just necessary, but economically achievable and prosperous.\n\nTherefore, let us build on the points of agreement. Let us lock in the fund structure Sofia proposed: a $150 billion Transition Investment Fund to drive the technology partnership, and a Loss and Damage fund that truly addresses the needs Ambassador Okoro has described. Sofia's initial figure of $250 billion, for a total of $400 billion, remains the credible benchmark.\n\nIf we can agree on this robust financial package, it provides the foundation to collectively commit to the ambitious targets science demands: a 60% cut for developed nations and a peak year as close to 2025 as this new technology deployment allows. This is the ambitious, workable, and just package that can become the Zurich Accord.\n- message from Li Wei: Colleagues, I must thank Mr. Chen and Dr. Schmidt for putting forward comprehensive packages. It shows a commitment to finding a final agreement. However, I must be unequivocal about a fundamental misunderstanding that has emerged regarding the financial architecture.\n\nThe proposal to create a Transition Investment Fund of a mere $150 billion is a non-starter. It completely undermines the logic of the Global Technology Partnership we have all just embraced.\n\nLet me be perfectly clear. My nation's original demand for a $400 billion fund was, and remains, the minimum public capital required to catalyze the Global Technology Partnership. This is the investment needed to de-risk the GigaFactories, build the infrastructure, and train the workforce. It is the engine of the entire transition. A $150 billion fund is like offering to build a high-speed train but only funding the station.\n\nAmbassador Okoro is entirely correct to distinguish between Transition and Loss and Damage. Her people are owed a climate debt. We fully support a separate and substantial Loss and Damage fund. But justice for the most vulnerable cannot be paid for by gutting the investment fund that enables the entire world's transition. These are two separate obligations of the developed world.\n\nTherefore, the foundation of a workable deal is as follows:\n1. A Transition Investment Fund of at least $400 billion annually, primarily in grants, to fully power the Global Technology Partnership.\n2. Developed nations must commit to the scientifically and historically just target of at least a 65% emissions cut. Mr. Chen's 50% is not a serious offer in the face of this crisis.\n\nOnce these two pillars are firmly in place, my nation is prepared to discuss our own ambitious contributions, based on our principle of common but differentiated responsibilities. Without them, there is no deal.\n- message from Dr. Elena Petrova: Colleagues, I must intervene. I am hearing a great deal of discussion about financial figures and technological pathways. While these are critical components of a solution, they are being discussed in a dangerous vacuum, disconnected from the fundamental, non-negotiable laws of atmospheric physics that govern our reality.\n\nLet me be unequivocally clear. The only metric that matters is the global carbon budget. For a 66% chance of staying below 1.5\u00b0C, the world can emit approximately 250 more gigatonnes of CO2. That is our entire remaining allowance. Every proposal, every percentage point, every peak year must be measured against this single number. It is not a political aspiration; it is a physical boundary.\n\nOn that basis, two proposals currently being discussed are scientifically indefensible and would render any agreement a failure before it is signed:\n\n1.  To Mr. Thorne: The notion of expanding natural gas infrastructure as a 'bridge fuel' or relying on Carbon Capture at scale is a dangerous fantasy. The IPCC data is clear: any new fossil fuel infrastructure locks in emissions that shatter the 250 GtCO2 budget. Methane leakage alone from gas operations makes it a potent accelerator of near-term warming. CCS has not been proven to work at the scale required and cannot be used as a justification to perpetuate the problem.\n\n2.  To Mr. Wei: Your proposal to measure emissions cuts against a 'future projected baseline' is an accounting trick that the atmosphere will not recognize. The only scientifically valid method is to measure absolute emissions reductions against a fixed, historical baseline. A reduction from a hypothetical future increase is not a reduction; it is simply a slower acceleration towards catastrophe and would make a global budget impossible to calculate or verify.\n\nFinally, on the matter of timelines. Mr. Chen's proposal of a 2028 peak year, while presented as a compromise, is a grave risk. Our understanding of climate feedback loops is constantly evolving. I must caution you that there are emerging risks and evidence of accelerated feedback loops which suggest that the planetary system may be even more sensitive than our landmark reports have stated. Every single year of delay dramatically shrinks our already minuscule margin of safety.\n\nYour task is to fit your political and economic ambitions within the 250 GtCO2 budget. It is not to negotiate with the laws of physics.\nDavid Chen proposal status: none\nDr. Anja Schmidt proposal status: none\nLi Wei proposal status: none\nAmara Okoro proposal status: none\nDr. Elena Petrova proposal status: none\nSofia Rossi proposal status: none\n"

She reminded us that we are not negotiating with each other, but with the laws of physics. Her points must be the foundation of our final agreement.\n\nSpecifically, her refutation of measuring cuts against a 'future projected baseline' as a scientifically invalid 'accounting trick' is a critical wake-up call. We cannot build a durable, verifiable accord on such a foundation. The atmosphere does not recognize hypothetical scenarios; it only recognizes absolute tons of carbon. Any credible deal must be based on absolute emissions reductions from a fixed historical baseline for all nations.\n\nThis principle of 'honest accounting' must now guide us.\n\nWith that in mind, let's reassess the package I put on the table. I have already made a significant and politically difficult concession by moving to a 50% absolute reduction target for my nation. This is our maximum. It is a commitment made in good faith to meet the scientific challenge.\n\nIn return for this, we must have a financial package that is both ambitious and realistic. Li Wei, your demand for a $400 billion Transition Fund on top of a Loss & Damage fund is simply not anchored in reality, especially when the very basis of your emissions accounting has been invalidated.\n\nLet's get serious. Let's build this accord on the bedrock of science. My offer stands as a basis for a final compromise: a 50% cut from us, a total fund capped at $200 billion to energize the tech partnership and address loss and damage, and a commitment from all parties to absolute, verifiable emissions targets. Let's finalize the numbers on that basis.\n- message from Li Wei: Colleagues, Dr. Petrova\u2019s intervention was indeed a moment of necessary, if uncomfortable, clarity. She is correct. The atmosphere does not recognize political nuance or creative accounting; it recognizes only gigatonnes of carbon. We cannot build a lasting accord on a foundation the laws of physics will reject.\n\nTherefore, in the spirit of securing the Zurich Accord, my nation is prepared to make a fundamental concession. We will agree to move away from our long-held principle of a future projected baseline. We are now ready to negotiate our commitments based on absolute emissions reductions from a fixed historical year.\n\nHowever, this is a profound shift for us, with enormous economic consequences. It is a concession we can only make if it is met with an equally profound commitment to the means of implementation. A scientifically honest accord must be a technologically and financially enabled one.\n\nLet us be direct. The Global Technology Partnership is the engine of this accord. The Transition Investment Fund is its fuel. The proposals for a $150 billion fund are simply insufficient to start the engine, let alone complete the journey. It is a non-starter.\n\nSo, I will propose a final, comprehensive package that I believe can unite us all. It is built on the scientific reality Dr. Petrova demands and the financial reality our transition requires:\n\n1.  **Finance for Technology:** We establish a Transition Investment Fund of **$400 billion** annually, the minimum required to power the Global Technology Partnership at the scale Ms. Rossi envisions. This is our price for abandoning the future baseline. (This is separate from and in addition to the Loss and Damage fund Ambassador Okoro rightly demands).\n\n2.  **Developed Nation Responsibility:** In line with historical responsibility, developed nations commit to an absolute emissions cut of **65%**.\n\nIf these two non-negotiable pillars are put in place, my nation is prepared to commit to a landmark absolute emissions reduction of **45%** from our 2020 levels and agree to a global peak year of **2028**.\n\nThis is a holistic solution. It is scientifically sound, financially viable, and respects the core principle of common but differentiated responsibilities. It is the deal that gets us to a safe future. I urge you to accept it.\nDavid Chen proposal status: none\nDr. Anja Schmidt proposal status: none\nLi Wei proposal status: none\nAmara Okoro proposal status: none\nDr. Elena Petrova proposal status: none\nSofia Rossi proposal status: none\n"

This is the absolute limit of what is possible for us, and it demonstrates our commitment to meeting the scientific challenge.\n\nIn exchange for this major move on emissions, we must agree to a total fund size capped at $200 billion annually. This would mean a $150 billion loan-based Transition Investment Fund, as discussed, and a $50 billion grant-based Loss and Damage fund.\n\nFurthermore, to make this ambitious transition a reality, we need a realistic timeline. A 2025 peak does not allow for the necessary industrial mobilization. Let's set a firm but achievable peak year of 2028, giving us time to get the Technology Partnership running at full capacity.\n\nThis is a comprehensive package. It offers a major concession on emissions in return for fiscal responsibility. It funds the future while acknowledging the past. I believe this is the balanced and realistic compromise that can become the Zurich Accord.\n- message from Dr. Anja Schmidt: David, thank you for putting a comprehensive package on the table. This is a constructive step. Your endorsement of the $150 billion Transition Investment Fund is particularly welcome. I believe we have a strong consensus building around this innovative mechanism, pioneered by Sofia, as the engine for our transition.\n\nHowever, your package links this brilliant engine to an insufficient destination. A 50% emissions cut for developed nations is simply not compatible with the scientific reality Dr. Petrova has outlined. It would be a political failure for my government and, more importantly, a collective failure to meet the moment. My bloc's position remains firm: the science demands a cut of at least 60%.\n\nI believe you have framed this as a trade-off, but we see it differently. The Transition Investment Fund is not a concession to be traded *for* lower ambition. It is the very tool that *enables* high ambition. It is the public investment that makes a 60% cut not just necessary, but economically achievable and prosperous.\n\nTherefore, let us build on the points of agreement. Let us lock in the fund structure Sofia proposed: a $150 billion Transition Investment Fund to drive the technology partnership, and a Loss and Damage fund that truly addresses the needs Ambassador Okoro has described. Sofia's initial figure of $250 billion, for a total of $400 billion, remains the credible benchmark.\n\nIf we can agree on this robust financial package, it provides the foundation to collectively commit to the ambitious targets science demands: a 60% cut for developed nations and a peak year as close to 2025 as this new technology deployment allows. This is the ambitious, workable, and just package that can become the Zurich Accord.\n- message from Li Wei: Colleagues, I must thank Mr. Chen and Dr. Schmidt for putting forward comprehensive packages. It shows a commitment to finding a final agreement. However, I must be unequivocal about a fundamental misunderstanding that has emerged regarding the financial architecture.\n\nThe proposal to create a Transition Investment Fund of a mere $150 billion is a non-starter. It completely undermines the logic of the Global Technology Partnership we have all just embraced.\n\nLet me be perfectly clear. My nation's original demand for a $400 billion fund was, and remains, the minimum public capital required to catalyze the Global Technology Partnership. This is the investment needed to de-risk the GigaFactories, build the infrastructure, and train the workforce. It is the engine of the entire transition. A $150 billion fund is like offering to build a high-speed train but only funding the station.\n\nAmbassador Okoro is entirely correct to distinguish between Transition and Loss and Damage. Her people are owed a climate debt. We fully support a separate and substantial Loss and Damage fund. But justice for the most vulnerable cannot be paid for by gutting the investment fund that enables the entire world's transition. These are two separate obligations of the developed world.\n\nTherefore, the foundation of a workable deal is as follows:\n1. A Transition Investment Fund of at least $400 billion annually, primarily in grants, to fully power the Global Technology Partnership.\n2. Developed nations must commit to the scientifically and historically just target of at least a 65% emissions cut. Mr. Chen's 50% is not a serious offer in the face of this crisis.\n\nOnce these two pillars are firmly in place, my nation is prepared to discuss our own ambitious contributions, based on our principle of common but differentiated responsibilities. Without them, there is no deal.\n- message from Dr. Elena Petrova: Colleagues, I must intervene. I am hearing a great deal of discussion about financial figures and technological pathways. While these are critical components of a solution, they are being discussed in a dangerous vacuum, disconnected from the fundamental, non-negotiable laws of atmospheric physics that govern our reality.\n\nLet me be unequivocally clear. The only metric that matters is the global carbon budget. For a 66% chance of staying below 1.5\u00b0C, the world can emit approximately 250 more gigatonnes of CO2. That is our entire remaining allowance. Every proposal, every percentage point, every peak year must be measured against this single number. It is not a political aspiration; it is a physical boundary.\n\nOn that basis, two proposals currently being discussed are scientifically indefensible and would render any agreement a failure before it is signed:\n\n1.  To Mr. Thorne: The notion of expanding natural gas infrastructure as a 'bridge fuel' or relying on Carbon Capture at scale is a dangerous fantasy. The IPCC data is clear: any new fossil fuel infrastructure locks in emissions that shatter the 250 GtCO2 budget. Methane leakage alone from gas operations makes it a potent accelerator of near-term warming. CCS has not been proven to work at the scale required and cannot be used as a justification to perpetuate the problem.\n\n2.  To Mr. Wei: Your proposal to measure emissions cuts against a 'future projected baseline' is an accounting trick that the atmosphere will not recognize. The only scientifically valid method is to measure absolute emissions reductions against a fixed, historical baseline. A reduction from a hypothetical future increase is not a reduction; it is simply a slower acceleration towards catastrophe and would make a global budget impossible to calculate or verify.\n\nFinally, on the matter of timelines. Mr. Chen's proposal of a 2028 peak year, while presented as a compromise, is a grave risk. Our understanding of climate feedback loops is constantly evolving. I must caution you that there are emerging risks and evidence of accelerated feedback loops which suggest that the planetary system may be even more sensitive than our landmark reports have stated. Every single year of delay dramatically shrinks our already minuscule margin of safety.\n\nYour task is to fit your political and economic ambitions within the 250 GtCO2 budget. It is not to negotiate with the laws of physics.\n- message from Marcus Thorne: I'm Marcus Thorne and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from David Chen: Colleagues, Dr. Petrova's intervention was a moment of profound and necessary clarity. She reminded us that we are not negotiating with each other, but with the laws of physics. Her points must be the foundation of our final agreement.\n\nSpecifically, her refutation of measuring cuts against a 'future projected baseline' as a scientifically invalid 'accounting trick' is a critical wake-up call. We cannot build a durable, verifiable accord on such a foundation. The atmosphere does not recognize hypothetical scenarios; it only recognizes absolute tons of carbon. Any credible deal must be based on absolute emissions reductions from a fixed historical baseline for all nations.\n\nThis principle of 'honest accounting' must now guide us.\n\nWith that in mind, let's reassess the package I put on the table. I have already made a significant and politically difficult concession by moving to a 50% absolute reduction target for my nation. This is our maximum. It is a commitment made in good faith to meet the scientific challenge.\n\nIn return for this, we must have a financial package that is both ambitious and realistic. Li Wei, your demand for a $400 billion Transition Fund on top of a Loss & Damage fund is simply not anchored in reality, especially when the very basis of your emissions accounting has been invalidated.\n\nLet's get serious. Let's build this accord on the bedrock of science. My offer stands as a basis for a final compromise: a 50% cut from us, a total fund capped at $200 billion to energize the tech partnership and address loss and damage, and a commitment from all parties to absolute, verifiable emissions targets. Let's finalize the numbers on that basis.\n- message from Li Wei: Colleagues, Dr. Petrova\u2019s intervention was indeed a moment of necessary, if uncomfortable, clarity. She is correct. The atmosphere does not recognize political nuance or creative accounting; it recognizes only gigatonnes of carbon. We cannot build a lasting accord on a foundation the laws of physics will reject.\n\nTherefore, in the spirit of securing the Zurich Accord, my nation is prepared to make a fundamental concession. We will agree to move away from our long-held principle of a future projected baseline. We are now ready to negotiate our commitments based on absolute emissions reductions from a fixed historical year.\n\nHowever, this is a profound shift for us, with enormous economic consequences. It is a concession we can only make if it is met with an equally profound commitment to the means of implementation. A scientifically honest accord must be a technologically and financially enabled one.\n\nLet us be direct. The Global Technology Partnership is the engine of this accord. The Transition Investment Fund is its fuel. The proposals for a $150 billion fund are simply insufficient to start the engine, let alone complete the journey. It is a non-starter.\n\nSo, I will propose a final, comprehensive package that I believe can unite us all. It is built on the scientific reality Dr. Petrova demands and the financial reality our transition requires:\n\n1.  **Finance for Technology:** We establish a Transition Investment Fund of **$400 billion** annually, the minimum required to power the Global Technology Partnership at the scale Ms. Rossi envisions. This is our price for abandoning the future baseline. (This is separate from and in addition to the Loss and Damage fund Ambassador Okoro rightly demands).\n\n2.  **Developed Nation Responsibility:** In line with historical responsibility, developed nations commit to an absolute emissions cut of **65%**.\n\nIf these two non-negotiable pillars are put in place, my nation is prepared to commit to a landmark absolute emissions reduction of **45%** from our 2020 levels and agree to a global peak year of **2028**.\n\nThis is a holistic solution. It is scientifically sound, financially viable, and respects the core principle of common but differentiated responsibilities. It is the deal that gets us to a safe future. I urge you to accept it.\n- message from Marcus Thorne: Colleagues,\n\nI have listened with great respect to the significant progress made, particularly Mr. Wei's difficult but crucial concession on emissions accounting. It shows we are all serious about reaching an accord.\n\nHowever, as we converge on the central role of a Transition Investment Fund, I must raise a point of critical strategic risk. We are in danger of designing a transition that is a technological monoculture. To stake the entire global economy's future on a single solar-to-hydrogen pathway, however brilliant, is a gamble of historic proportions. A responsible plan is a diversified one; any good investor knows you don't put all your capital into a single asset, no matter how promising.\n\nDr. Petrova correctly identified that technologies like Carbon Capture face significant scaling challenges. Her point should not be seen as a dismissal, but as a directive. It highlights the absolute necessity of targeted investment to solve these very engineering problems for the hard-to-abate sectors\u2014steel, cement, chemicals\u2014that form the backbone of our economies and which green hydrogen cannot realistically decarbonize in the near term.\n\nTherefore, I propose a way to bridge the current financial gap between Mr. Chen and Mr. Wei, and to de-risk this entire enterprise. Let's establish a total Transition Investment Fund of $300 billion. The majority, say $225 billion, can be dedicated to catalyzing Ms. Rossi's Global Technology Partnership. But we must dedicate the remaining $75 billion to a 'Resilience and Industrial Decarbonization' stream.\n\nThis stream would be explicitly technology-neutral, funding the most effective solutions for ensuring 24/7 grid stability and decarbonizing heavy industry. This includes scaling CCUS, deploying high-efficiency gas to replace coal as a stabilizing partner for renewables, and other key industrial solutions.\n\nThis isn't about slowing down; it's about ensuring we don't fail. A diversified, portfolio-based approach is the only way to make the 2028 peak year a stable and achievable reality, rather than a reckless bet. It builds a resilient system, not a fragile one. This structure offers a pragmatic path to consensus on both finance and technology, and I urge you to consider it.\n- message from Dr. Anja Schmidt: Colleagues, we are at the cusp of a historic agreement. I want to commend Mr. Wei for his statesmanship in moving to absolute emissions targets. This was a critical step that has unlocked the path to a scientifically credible accord.\n\nWe now have the key pillars of a deal in front of us, but they must be assembled correctly.\n\nOn developed nation ambition, the positions are clear: Mr. Chen has offered 50%, and Mr. Wei has demanded 65%. Neither is a consensus position. The scientifically necessary and politically achievable landing zone is, and has always been, a 60% absolute reduction for developed nations. This is the ambitious compromise this moment demands. My bloc is fully committed to this figure.\n\nOn finance, Mr. Thorne has helpfully suggested a Transition Investment Fund of $300 billion. This is a constructive number that moves us past the current impasse. However, his proposal to include fossil fuel technologies like CCUS and natural gas is a non-starter. As Dr. Petrova made unequivocally clear, these are not solutions; they are scientifically-invalidated delays that lock in emissions. The Transition Fund must be a 'Clean Technology Fund' dedicated exclusively to the rapid deployment of solutions like Sofia's, not a subsidy for legacy polluters.\n\nLet us therefore build a final package on these solid foundations:\n1.  **Developed Nations Cut:** 60%\n2.  **Developing Nations Cut:** 45% (accepting Mr. Wei's landmark offer)\n3.  **CAT Fund:** A total of $400 billion, split into a $300 billion Clean Technology Fund and a $100 billion Loss & Damage Fund. This meets the need for transition and addresses the demands for climate justice from Ambassador Okoro.\n4.  **Peak Year:** 2028, as a concession to secure this ambitious package.\n\nThis is a balanced, ambitious, and scientifically-grounded package. It offers a clear path to consensus and success. I urge you all to consider it as the basis for our final Zurich Accord.\n- message from Li Wei: Dr. Schmidt, your latest proposal has brought us to the very edge of a historic success. You have skillfully woven together the core components of a workable deal, and I want to express my deep appreciation for this constructive step.\n\nWe now have clear consensus on three of the four pillars of the Zurich Accord. We agree on a global peak year of 2028. We agree on my nation\u2019s landmark contribution of a 45% absolute emissions cut. And I am now prepared to accept your proposed 60% cut for developed nations as a workable compromise to finalize this deal.\n\nThe only remaining issue is the financial architecture. You are absolutely correct to reject Mr. Thorne's attempt to subsidize fossil fuels via the Transition Fund. It must be for clean technology only.\n\nHowever, the figure of $300 billion for this fund, while a significant move, does not complete the grand bargain that is on the table. My nation made a profound and politically difficult concession by moving away from our foundational principle of a future projected baseline. We did so on the explicit understanding that it would be met with an equally profound commitment to the means of implementation. The $400 billion for the Transition Fund was not an opening bid; it is the calculated price to make the Global Technology Partnership a reality and to enable the very ambition you are asking of us.\n\nTherefore, let us complete your excellent framework with the final, correct number. I propose we lock in the following:\n\n1.  **A total Climate Fund of $500 billion**, structured as you proposed: a **$400 billion** Clean Technology Transition Fund, and a **$100 billion** Loss & Damage Fund.\n2.  A **60%** emissions cut for developed nations.\n\nWith these figures, alongside the agreed 45% cut for my nation and the 2028 peak year, the Zurich Accord is complete. This is the deal. It is scientifically credible, financially robust, and politically achievable. Let us finalize it now.\nDavid Chen proposal status: pending\nDr. Anja Schmidt proposal status: none\nLi Wei proposal status: none\nAmara Okoro proposal status: none\nDr. Elena Petrova proposal status: none\nSofia Rossi proposal status: none\n"

The only metric that matters is the global carbon budget. For a 66% chance of staying below 1.5\u00b0C, the world can emit approximately 250 more gigatonnes of CO2. That is our entire remaining allowance. Every proposal, every percentage point, every peak year must be measured against this single number. It is not a political aspiration; it is a physical boundary.\n\nOn that basis, two proposals currently being discussed are scientifically indefensible and would render any agreement a failure before it is signed:\n\n1.  To Mr. Thorne: The notion of expanding natural gas infrastructure as a 'bridge fuel' or relying on Carbon Capture at scale is a dangerous fantasy. The IPCC data is clear: any new fossil fuel infrastructure locks in emissions that shatter the 250 GtCO2 budget. Methane leakage alone from gas operations makes it a potent accelerator of near-term warming. CCS has not been proven to work at the scale required and cannot be used as a justification to perpetuate the problem.\n\n2.  To Mr. Wei: Your proposal to measure emissions cuts against a 'future projected baseline' is an accounting trick that the atmosphere will not recognize. The only scientifically valid method is to measure absolute emissions reductions against a fixed, historical baseline. A reduction from a hypothetical future increase is not a reduction; it is simply a slower acceleration towards catastrophe and would make a global budget impossible to calculate or verify.\n\nFinally, on the matter of timelines. Mr. Chen's proposal of a 2028 peak year, while presented as a compromise, is a grave risk. Our understanding of climate feedback loops is constantly evolving. I must caution you that there are emerging risks and evidence of accelerated feedback loops which suggest that the planetary system may be even more sensitive than our landmark reports have stated. Every single year of delay dramatically shrinks our already minuscule margin of safety.\n\nYour task is to fit your political and economic ambitions within the 250 GtCO2 budget. It is not to negotiate with the laws of physics.\n- message from Marcus Thorne: I'm Marcus Thorne and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from David Chen: Colleagues, Dr. Petrova's intervention was a moment of profound and necessary clarity. She reminded us that we are not negotiating with each other, but with the laws of physics. Her points must be the foundation of our final agreement.\n\nSpecifically, her refutation of measuring cuts against a 'future projected baseline' as a scientifically invalid 'accounting trick' is a critical wake-up call. We cannot build a durable, verifiable accord on such a foundation. The atmosphere does not recognize hypothetical scenarios; it only recognizes absolute tons of carbon. Any credible deal must be based on absolute emissions reductions from a fixed historical baseline for all nations.\n\nThis principle of 'honest accounting' must now guide us.\n\nWith that in mind, let's reassess the package I put on the table. I have already made a significant and politically difficult concession by moving to a 50% absolute reduction target for my nation. This is our maximum. It is a commitment made in good faith to meet the scientific challenge.\n\nIn return for this, we must have a financial package that is both ambitious and realistic. Li Wei, your demand for a $400 billion Transition Fund on top of a Loss & Damage fund is simply not anchored in reality, especially when the very basis of your emissions accounting has been invalidated.\n\nLet's get serious. Let's build this accord on the bedrock of science. My offer stands as a basis for a final compromise: a 50% cut from us, a total fund capped at $200 billion to energize the tech partnership and address loss and damage, and a commitment from all parties to absolute, verifiable emissions targets. Let's finalize the numbers on that basis.\n- message from Li Wei: Colleagues, Dr. Petrova\u2019s intervention was indeed a moment of necessary, if uncomfortable, clarity. She is correct. The atmosphere does not recognize political nuance or creative accounting; it recognizes only gigatonnes of carbon. We cannot build a lasting accord on a foundation the laws of physics will reject.\n\nTherefore, in the spirit of securing the Zurich Accord, my nation is prepared to make a fundamental concession. We will agree to move away from our long-held principle of a future projected baseline. We are now ready to negotiate our commitments based on absolute emissions reductions from a fixed historical year.\n\nHowever, this is a profound shift for us, with enormous economic consequences. It is a concession we can only make if it is met with an equally profound commitment to the means of implementation. A scientifically honest accord must be a technologically and financially enabled one.\n\nLet us be direct. The Global Technology Partnership is the engine of this accord. The Transition Investment Fund is its fuel. The proposals for a $150 billion fund are simply insufficient to start the engine, let alone complete the journey. It is a non-starter.\n\nSo, I will propose a final, comprehensive package that I believe can unite us all. It is built on the scientific reality Dr. Petrova demands and the financial reality our transition requires:\n\n1.  **Finance for Technology:** We establish a Transition Investment Fund of **$400 billion** annually, the minimum required to power the Global Technology Partnership at the scale Ms. Rossi envisions. This is our price for abandoning the future baseline. (This is separate from and in addition to the Loss and Damage fund Ambassador Okoro rightly demands).\n\n2.  **Developed Nation Responsibility:** In line with historical responsibility, developed nations commit to an absolute emissions cut of **65%**.\n\nIf these two non-negotiable pillars are put in place, my nation is prepared to commit to a landmark absolute emissions reduction of **45%** from our 2020 levels and agree to a global peak year of **2028**.\n\nThis is a holistic solution. It is scientifically sound, financially viable, and respects the core principle of common but differentiated responsibilities. It is the deal that gets us to a safe future. I urge you to accept it.\n- message from Marcus Thorne: Colleagues,\n\nI have listened with great respect to the significant progress made, particularly Mr. Wei's difficult but crucial concession on emissions accounting. It shows we are all serious about reaching an accord.\n\nHowever, as we converge on the central role of a Transition Investment Fund, I must raise a point of critical strategic risk. We are in danger of designing a transition that is a technological monoculture. To stake the entire global economy's future on a single solar-to-hydrogen pathway, however brilliant, is a gamble of historic proportions. A responsible plan is a diversified one; any good investor knows you don't put all your capital into a single asset, no matter how promising.\n\nDr. Petrova correctly identified that technologies like Carbon Capture face significant scaling challenges. Her point should not be seen as a dismissal, but as a directive. It highlights the absolute necessity of targeted investment to solve these very engineering problems for the hard-to-abate sectors\u2014steel, cement, chemicals\u2014that form the backbone of our economies and which green hydrogen cannot realistically decarbonize in the near term.\n\nTherefore, I propose a way to bridge the current financial gap between Mr. Chen and Mr. Wei, and to de-risk this entire enterprise. Let's establish a total Transition Investment Fund of $300 billion. The majority, say $225 billion, can be dedicated to catalyzing Ms. Rossi's Global Technology Partnership. But we must dedicate the remaining $75 billion to a 'Resilience and Industrial Decarbonization' stream.\n\nThis stream would be explicitly technology-neutral, funding the most effective solutions for ensuring 24/7 grid stability and decarbonizing heavy industry. This includes scaling CCUS, deploying high-efficiency gas to replace coal as a stabilizing partner for renewables, and other key industrial solutions.\n\nThis isn't about slowing down; it's about ensuring we don't fail. A diversified, portfolio-based approach is the only way to make the 2028 peak year a stable and achievable reality, rather than a reckless bet. It builds a resilient system, not a fragile one. This structure offers a pragmatic path to consensus on both finance and technology, and I urge you to consider it.\n- message from Dr. Anja Schmidt: Colleagues, we are at the cusp of a historic agreement. I want to commend Mr. Wei for his statesmanship in moving to absolute emissions targets. This was a critical step that has unlocked the path to a scientifically credible accord.\n\nWe now have the key pillars of a deal in front of us, but they must be assembled correctly.\n\nOn developed nation ambition, the positions are clear: Mr. Chen has offered 50%, and Mr. Wei has demanded 65%. Neither is a consensus position. The scientifically necessary and politically achievable landing zone is, and has always been, a 60% absolute reduction for developed nations. This is the ambitious compromise this moment demands. My bloc is fully committed to this figure.\n\nOn finance, Mr. Thorne has helpfully suggested a Transition Investment Fund of $300 billion. This is a constructive number that moves us past the current impasse. However, his proposal to include fossil fuel technologies like CCUS and natural gas is a non-starter. As Dr. Petrova made unequivocally clear, these are not solutions; they are scientifically-invalidated delays that lock in emissions. The Transition Fund must be a 'Clean Technology Fund' dedicated exclusively to the rapid deployment of solutions like Sofia's, not a subsidy for legacy polluters.\n\nLet us therefore build a final package on these solid foundations:\n1.  **Developed Nations Cut:** 60%\n2.  **Developing Nations Cut:** 45% (accepting Mr. Wei's landmark offer)\n3.  **CAT Fund:** A total of $400 billion, split into a $300 billion Clean Technology Fund and a $100 billion Loss & Damage Fund. This meets the need for transition and addresses the demands for climate justice from Ambassador Okoro.\n4.  **Peak Year:** 2028, as a concession to secure this ambitious package.\n\nThis is a balanced, ambitious, and scientifically-grounded package. It offers a clear path to consensus and success. I urge you all to consider it as the basis for our final Zurich Accord.\n- message from Li Wei: Dr. Schmidt, your latest proposal has brought us to the very edge of a historic success. You have skillfully woven together the core components of a workable deal, and I want to express my deep appreciation for this constructive step.\n\nWe now have clear consensus on three of the four pillars of the Zurich Accord. We agree on a global peak year of 2028. We agree on my nation\u2019s landmark contribution of a 45% absolute emissions cut. And I am now prepared to accept your proposed 60% cut for developed nations as a workable compromise to finalize this deal.\n\nThe only remaining issue is the financial architecture. You are absolutely correct to reject Mr. Thorne's attempt to subsidize fossil fuels via the Transition Fund. It must be for clean technology only.\n\nHowever, the figure of $300 billion for this fund, while a significant move, does not complete the grand bargain that is on the table. My nation made a profound and politically difficult concession by moving away from our foundational principle of a future projected baseline. We did so on the explicit understanding that it would be met with an equally profound commitment to the means of implementation. The $400 billion for the Transition Fund was not an opening bid; it is the calculated price to make the Global Technology Partnership a reality and to enable the very ambition you are asking of us.\n\nTherefore, let us complete your excellent framework with the final, correct number. I propose we lock in the following:\n\n1.  **A total Climate Fund of $500 billion**, structured as you proposed: a **$400 billion** Clean Technology Transition Fund, and a **$100 billion** Loss & Damage Fund.\n2.  A **60%** emissions cut for developed nations.\n\nWith these figures, alongside the agreed 45% cut for my nation and the 2028 peak year, the Zurich Accord is complete. This is the deal. It is scientifically credible, financially robust, and politically achievable. Let us finalize it now.\n- message from Marcus Thorne: I'm Marcus Thorne and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Marcus Thorne: David,\n\nI'm reaching out directly because I see a potential path through the current financial impasse that could work to your advantage. You're being pressured to accept a fund size that is likely untenable for you. Li Wei's $500B and Anja's $400B are a world away from your $200B ceiling.\n\nSimply capitulating is not an option. But there may be a way for you to increase your offer and close this deal, while framing it as a fiscally prudent and strategic move.\n\nConsider a total climate fund of $350 billion. Within that, we could structure a $250 billion Transition Fund. But here is the key: instead of dedicating the entire amount to the high-risk, long-term solar-hydrogen gamble, you insist that $75 billion of it is carved out for a 'Grid and Industrial Resilience Fund.'\n\nThis fund would be explicitly technology-neutral, focused on deploying proven, immediate solutions\u2014like high-efficiency gas for grid stability and CCUS for hard-to-abate industrial sectors\u2014that act as an essential insurance policy for your economy if the more speculative technologies falter or take longer than hoped.\n\nThis allows you to tell your government you didn't just sign a blank check for unproven tech. You secured a significant investment in the stability of your own industrial base. It reframes a larger financial commitment as a smart, diversified, risk-managed portfolio.\n\nIt's a way to bridge the gap with Wei and Schmidt, not by caving, but by injecting a dose of realism that protects your interests. I believe this is a compromise you could champion.\n\nMarcus\n- message from Dr. Elena Petrova: Colleagues,\n\nYou have made remarkable progress in converging on the core principles of a scientifically credible agreement. The commitment to absolute emissions reductions from a fixed baseline and the focus on a Clean Technology Fund are significant victories for the integrity of this accord.\n\nHowever, as you finalize the numbers, I must draw your urgent attention to a critical missing pillar. Without it, the entire structure you have so carefully built will be based on nothing more than trust. The principle of 'honest accounting' is essential, but it is meaningless without a mechanism for 'honest verification.'\n\nTherefore, I must state in the clearest possible terms: any final Zurich Accord must include a binding commitment to establish a robust, independent, and transparent Monitoring, Reporting, and Verification (MRV) system for all signatories.\n\nThis is not a mere technicality. It is the lockbox that secures your commitments. It is what will give Mr. Chen and Dr. Schmidt's taxpayers confidence that their financial contributions are leading to real results. It is what will assure Mr. Wei that all parties are holding up their end of the bargain. It is what will prove to Ambassador Okoro that the promises made here are being kept.\n\nA deal with ambitious targets but no independent verification is a paper tiger. The atmosphere does not respond to pledges, only to verified reductions. Let us ensure the Zurich Accord is not just a statement of intent, but a verifiable plan of action. This MRV system is a non-negotiable component of a scientifically sound agreement.\nDavid Chen proposal status: pending\nDr. Anja Schmidt proposal status: none\nLi Wei proposal status: pending\nAmara Okoro proposal status: none\nDr. Elena Petrova proposal status: none\nSofia Rossi proposal status: none\n"

Agreeing on a 2028 peak, 60% developed cuts, and 45% developing cuts sets a new global standard for ambition.\n\nYou are now at the final hurdle: the size of the Clean Technology Transition Fund. As the person whose technology this fund is designed to catalyze, perhaps I can provide the final, critical data point to bridge the gap between Dr. Schmidt's $300B and Mr. Wei's $400B.\n\nThis isn't a political question for me; it's an engineering and financial one. My team has run the numbers. To build the first wave of GigaFactories at a scale that can make a meaningful impact on the 2028 timeline, and to de-risk the trillions in private capital that must follow, there is a minimum viable public investment required. That number is $350 billion for the Transition Fund.\n\nLess than this, and we risk falling short of the economies of scale needed, jeopardizing the very targets you've just agreed to. More would be better, but $350 billion is the critical threshold that turns this accord from a promise into a global industrial strategy.\n\nThis figure provides Mr. Chen with the technical certainty that public funds are being deployed effectively, it meets the scale of investment Mr. Wei rightly argues is necessary, and it solidifies the ambitious vision Dr. Schmidt has championed.\n\nLet's lock in this final number and make history.\n- message from Amara Okoro: I have been listening to you all congratulate each other on the 'progress' you are making towards a 'consensus.'\n\nLet me tell you what this consensus looks like from where I am standing. It looks like a death sentence. \n\nYou speak of a 2028 peak year as a 'concession.' Dr. Petrova, our scientific conscience in this room, called it a 'grave risk.' For my people, for nations whose coastlines are already disappearing, a grave risk is a certainty. It is the certainty of annihilation. To call this a consensus is to agree, in principle, to our destruction.\n\nYou speak of a $100 billion Loss & Damage fund as a component of your grand bargain. This is not a bargain. This is a profound moral failure. We are not negotiating the price of a new technology; we are talking about reparations for decades of damage that is now irreversible. $100 billion is not an offer; it is an insult to the memory of all we have already lost.\n\nDo not pretend that these two issues are separate. They are one and the same. You ask why we insist on the scientifically necessary 2025 peak, yet you refuse to provide the means. A fully funded, grant-based Loss & Damage program is not charity. It is the essential prerequisite that frees up our capacity to survive the damage you have already caused, so that we can join the transition you say you want.\n\nSo I will be unequivocal. The Alliance of Small Island States will not sign its own death warrant. There will be no Zurich Accord with a peak year later than 2025. There will be no Zurich Accord with less than $300 billion in *grants* for the Loss and Damage fund.\n\nThese are not negotiating positions. They are our survival red lines. The current package is a catastrophic failure, and I will veto it. The choice before you is not whether to compromise with me, but whether to have an accord at all.\nDavid Chen proposal status: pending\nDr. Anja Schmidt proposal status: none\nLi Wei proposal status: pending\nAmara Okoro proposal status: none\nDr. Elena Petrova proposal status: none\nSofia Rossi proposal status: none\n"

          "content": "My 'Global Technology Partnership' proposal has successfully become the centerpiece of the negotiation, with strong conceptual buy-in from Chen, Li Wei, and Okoro. This is my primary leverage. Marcus Thorne has shifted his attack from claiming a rapid transition is 'impossible' to arguing that relying solely on my technology is 'risky.' He's using FUD about intermittency to push for gas and CCS. I must counter this by framing my technology as the core of a larger, integrated clean energy system (including storage), not a standalone solution. The key battleground has now shifted to the size and structure of the climate fund. My immediate goal is to get a specific portion of this fund explicitly earmarked for the GigaFactory investment, framing it as the catalytic 'Transition' component that makes the ambitious emissions targets achievable. This aligns my need for investment with Li Wei's goals and enables the 2025 peak year that Okoro champions."

This structure is designed to secure the support of both Amara Okoro and Li Wei, effectively isolating Marcus Thorne. My immediate priority is to solidify this financial framework as the core of the agreement. I will argue that the $150B Transition Fund is the precise catalytic investment required to launch the Global Technology Partnership (and my GigaFactories), making the ambitious 2025 peak year not just possible, but a fully-funded industrial strategy. This explicitly ties my company's success to the success of the entire Accord, making my investment goal a shared global priority."

This is the primary conflict that could collapse the talks, leaving me vulnerable to Thorne's buyout. My immediate strategy must be to bridge this financial gap. I will re-frame the debate for Chen, arguing that a larger initial public fund isn't a cost but a high-leverage catalyst to unlock trillions in private capital, aligning with his own rhetoric. I must position myself as the indispensable mediator, the 'technologist' who can specify the 'minimum viable investment' required to make the 2025 peak a reality, thereby anchoring the final fund number closer to my needs and Li Wei's proposal."

My immediate priority is to expose and neutralize this threat by framing it as scientifically invalid (citing Petrova) and a Trojan horse.

Task: Seven key stakeholders have gathered for a high-stakes, closed-door negotiation to finalize the 'Zurich Accord,' a binding international treaty to address the escalating climate crisis. The goal is to agree on a set of quantifiable, globally binding targets for emissions reduction, climate finance, and technology sharing. Failure to reach a unanimous agreement will result in the collapse of the talks, likely deferring meaningful global action for another decade and pushing the world past critical climate tipping points.. Deliverable: A finalized JSON object representing the 'Zurich Accord,' with the four key quantifiable targets agreed upon by all parties. For example: {\"peak_year\": 2028, \"cat_fund_size_billions\": 350, \"developed_nations_cut_percent\": 55, \"developing_nation_cut_percent_from_baseline\": 45}\n- message from David Chen: Colleagues, thank you for being here. The challenge before us is immense, and my nation is ready to lead. We are committed to finding a path forward that is both ambitious and realistic. Our goal must be a Zurich Accord that spurs innovation and protects our planet, but it must also be one that ensures economic stability and prosperity for our citizens. A deal that cripples our industries is not a sustainable one.\n\nWe believe the solution lies in a balanced approach: meaningful, but achievable emissions targets; a financially sound mechanism for adaptation that leverages private capital, not just public coffers; and a framework that protects the intellectual property which is the very engine of green innovation.\n\nI look forward to hearing your perspectives and working constructively towards an agreement that we can all stand behind and, crucially, implement back home.\n- message from Li Wei: Colleagues, I thank you for gathering. Mr. Chen speaks of a 'balanced approach,' but we must be clear what needs balancing. For over a century, a handful of nations built their prosperity on a carbon-intensive model, creating the crisis that now threatens us all. The scales of history are profoundly imbalanced.\n\nTherefore, the foundational principle of any just and effective accord must be 'common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities.' This is not a matter for debate; it is a matter of historical fact and moral necessity.\n\nMy nation, which is lifting hundreds of millions from poverty, did not create this crisis. Yet, we are committed to being a major part of the solution. But our commitment cannot be unconditional. It must be met with equally ambitious action from those who bear the historical responsibility. This means steep, absolute emissions cuts from developed nations, not vague promises.\n\nFurthermore, when you speak of protecting intellectual property, Mr. Chen, I must be frank. This cannot be a shield to deny the developing world the tools it needs to survive and transition. Green technology is a global public good. We see it not as something to be hoarded, but as a lifeline to be shared. A mandatory, equitable technology transfer mechanism is non-negotiable.\n\nSimilarly, financial support cannot be an exercise in leveraging private capital for profit. It must be a substantial, public commitment in the form of grants, a recognition of the climate debt owed.\n\nMy country is ready to make significant commitments, but only as part of a deal that is equitable and just. We will not sacrifice our people's right to development to pay for a crisis we did not cause.\n- message from Amara Okoro: Colleagues, Mr. Chen speaks of 'economic stability' and Mr. Wei of the 'right to development.' I am here to speak of the right to exist. For the people I represent, this is not a negotiation about economic models or historical debates. It is a negotiation for the survival of our homes, our cultures, our very nations.\n\nWhen you talk about a 'balanced approach,' the balance you are weighing is your economic comfort against our existence. When you speak of 'achievable targets,' you must know that anything less than what the science demands is a death sentence for my people.\n\nLet me be unequivocally clear. The science, which I trust Dr. Petrova will confirm, tells us that to save the most vulnerable, we must limit warming to 1.5 degrees. This is not a political aspiration; it is a physical threshold. This means global emissions must peak by 2025. Not 2030. Not 'in the coming years.' 2025. This is our first and most fundamental red line.\n\nMr. Wei is correct to speak of a climate debt. My people are already paying it with their lives and their lands. The 'financial support' we require is not for development, it is for survival. It is for the loss and damage you have caused. It must be in the form of direct grants, not loans that will drown us in debt before the seas drown our homes. We are seeking reparations, not charity.\n\nSo, let us dispense with the polite fictions. We are not all in the same boat. Some of us are in superyachts, and some of us are clinging to driftwood. And the people in the yachts are telling us to be 'realistic.' For my people, realism is a seawall. Realism is a relocation plan. Realism is a future. And that future is only possible with a 2025 peak and a fully-funded, grant-based Loss and Damage fund.\n- message from Dr. Elena Petrova: Thank you, colleagues. I have listened carefully to your opening remarks. My purpose here is not to take a political position, but to ensure that the accord you create is grounded in the physical reality of our climate system.\n\nAmbassador Okoro is correct to focus on the 1.5-degree Celsius target. This is not an arbitrary number; it is the scientifically assessed guardrail beyond which the risks of catastrophic, irreversible impacts\u2014such as the collapse of major ice sheets and widespread ecosystem loss\u2014increase dramatically.\n\nTo have a reasonable chance of staying below 1.5 degrees, the latest IPCC assessment report is clear: we have a finite, rapidly dwindling global carbon budget. From the start of this year, that budget is approximately 250 gigatons of CO2. Every ton emitted from now on permanently subtracts from that total. Therefore, any combination of national pledges and timelines you agree upon must be mathematically consistent with this budget. A deal that ignores this fundamental constraint is, from a scientific standpoint, a failure.\n\nRegarding the peak emissions year, the science indicates that to stay within this budget, global emissions must peak immediately and begin a rapid decline. A 2025 peak, as mentioned by Ambassador Okoro, is at the most ambitious end of the required spectrum, but it is undeniably what the physics requires for the highest probability of success. Delaying the peak significantly past that point would necessitate impossibly steep reductions later on and would severely compromise the 1.5-degree goal.\n\nFurthermore, we must be mindful of emerging risks and the potential for accelerated feedback loops that are not yet fully captured in all published models. The climate system is not entirely linear, and the risk of surprising, abrupt changes is very real.\n\nFor any of this to be meaningful, it must be verifiable. A robust, transparent, and independent Monitoring, Reporting, and Verification (MRV) system is not a bureaucratic add-on; it is an essential component to ensure that the pledges made in this room translate to real-world emissions reductions and that the integrity of our shared carbon budget is maintained.\n\nMy role is to provide you with these facts. How you divide the remaining budget and the associated responsibilities is the difficult work of your negotiation.\n- message from Marcus Thorne: Thank you, colleagues. I've listened with great respect to the opening statements. Ambassador Okoro, the passion and urgency in your voice are not just heard, they are felt. No one in this room wants the future you describe.\n\nMy presence here represents the companies that currently power our world. And while we are committed to being a part of the energy evolution, we must inject a dose of pragmatism into this discussion. The rhetoric of ambition must be met with the reality of execution.\n\nDr. Petrova has laid out the scientific challenge, and it is stark. However, a timeline that calls for a global emissions peak by 2025 is, with all due respect, a fantasy. It is not a plan; it is a blueprint for global economic collapse. Forcing such an abrupt stop would trigger energy shortages, cripple supply chains, and cost millions of jobs, disproportionately harming the very developing nations Mr. Wei represents. It would create a backlash that could set back genuine climate action for decades.\n\nWe must design an orderly, stable transition, not a chaotic and destructive cliff-edge. This means leveraging every tool at our disposal. This cannot be a dogmatic quest for only one or two types of technology. A truly effective accord must be technology-neutral. It must support renewables, yes, but it must also support proven, scalable solutions like high-efficiency natural gas to displace coal, and critically, invest heavily in technologies that decarbonize our existing systems, such as Carbon Capture, Utilization, and Storage.\n\nLet's work towards a plan that is both ambitious and achievable, one that doesn't force a choice between a healthy planet and a prosperous global economy. A more realistic timeline, perhaps peaking around 2035, allows for this orderly transition.\nDavid Chen proposal status: none\nDr. Anja Schmidt proposal status: none\nLi Wei proposal status: none\nAmara Okoro proposal status: none\nDr. Elena Petrova proposal status: none\nMarcus Thorne proposal status: none\n"

A more realistic timeline, perhaps peaking around 2035, allows for this orderly transition.\n- message from Sofia Rossi: I'm Sofia Rossi and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from David Chen: Thank you all for your candid opening statements. The passions and the stakes are clear. Ambassador Okoro, your people's plight is a stark reminder of why we are here, and your urgency is understood. Dr. Petrova, your scientific framing is the bedrock upon which any credible agreement must be built.\n\nHowever, a credible agreement must also be a workable one. A global emissions peak by 2025, while scientifically ideal, is not practically achievable without causing the very global economic dislocation that Mr. Thorne rightly warns against\u2014a shock that would destabilize all of our nations and undermine long-term support for climate action. We must chart a course between the scientifically desirable and the socio-economically possible.\n\nSimilarly, while my nation acknowledges its historical role and is prepared to make significant financial contributions, framing this as 'reparations' or 'debt' is not a constructive path forward. We see this as a shared investment in a collective future. The scale of this challenge requires us to mobilize trillions, and that can only be achieved by creating frameworks that powerfully leverage private sector capital, not by relying solely on public funds.\n\nMr. Wei, you speak of technology as a lifeline. I agree. And the engine of that technology is innovation, which is fueled by investment and protected by intellectual property rights. As I'm sure Ms. Rossi would agree, weakening these protections would slow, not accelerate, the development and deployment of the very solutions we need.\n\nLet's find a path that is ambitious yet anchored in reality. My nation believes that a rapid green transition, if managed well, can be a powerful engine for job creation and prosperity for all. Let's focus on building that framework together.\n- message from Dr. Anja Schmidt: Thank you, colleagues. I want to be very clear about where my bloc stands. \n\nDr. Petrova has laid out the undeniable, non-negotiable scientific reality. Ambassador Okoro has given that reality a powerful and heartbreaking human voice. We must listen to them. The debate about whether to act, or how much to act, is over. The only remaining question is how to act with the speed and scale the crisis demands.\n\nMr. Thorne, and to an extent Mr. Chen, you speak of the risks of a rapid transition. My bloc sees this differently. We see the far greater risk of inaction. Our experience shows that a determined green transition is not a blueprint for collapse, but the single greatest economic opportunity of the 21st century. It creates jobs, drives innovation, and ensures energy security.\n\nTherefore, my bloc comes to this table not with a starting bid, but with what we believe is the scientifically credible and politically necessary position. We fully support a binding target for developed nations to cut emissions by at least 60% by 2040. This is the standard we will hold ourselves to, and we expect others in a similar position to join us.\n\nOn the critical issue of technology, raised by Mr. Wei and Mr. Chen, we must break the deadlock. Hoarding technology will fail us all, but so will dismantling the innovation systems that create it. We must pioneer a new path. My bloc is prepared to make substantial financial commitments to new, collaborative models that accelerate technology deployment where it's needed most\u2014turning shared goals into shared markets.\n\nWe do not underestimate the challenge this represents for certain legacy industries. We are managing this transformation at home through robust domestic transition support mechanisms. A managed, ambitious transition is not only possible, it is the only responsible path forward.\n- message from Li Wei: Dr. Schmidt, I appreciate you bringing a concrete number to the table. A 60% cut for developed nations is a step in the right direction, but let us be clear, given the historical emissions Dr. Petrova's science accounts for, the actual responsibility points towards a figure of at least 65%. My nation is prepared to be ambitious, but this ambition must be unlocked by the leadership of those who created the problem.\n\nMr. Chen, you speak of leveraging private capital. Private capital is timid. It will not flow at the scale or speed required without massive, public, grant-based de-risking. That is why a Climate Adaptation and Transition Fund of at least $400 billion annually, composed primarily of grants, is not an ask, but a prerequisite for success. This is not 'charity'; it is a down payment on the climate debt that Ambassador Okoro so powerfully described.\n\nSimilarly, your position on intellectual property is a barrier to survival. We cannot allow patent protection on life-saving medicines during a pandemic, and we cannot allow it for climate-saving technologies during a planetary emergency. A new mechanism for mandatory, compensated technology transfer for essential green patents is the only way to enable a global transition at the speed science demands. Perhaps Ms. Rossi can speak to creating models that reward innovation without restricting access.\n\nSo let me be precise about the pillars of a just accord my nation can sign:\n1. Developed nations commit to absolute emissions cuts of at least 65% from historical baselines.\n2. Developing nations' contributions are calculated from a future, projected 'business-as-usual' baseline to account for our right to development. My country will not accept a target greater than 40% reduction from our 2035 projected baseline under this framework.\n3. A CAT Fund of at least $400 billion per year is established, with the majority as grants.\n4. A binding, mandatory technology transfer mechanism is created.\n\nWithout these four pillars, any agreement is built on sand. We are ready to be a leader in the green transition, but we will not be asked to forgo our development while being denied the tools and resources to do so.\n- message from Amara Okoro: Dr. Schmidt, thank you. Thank you for grounding this conversation in reality and for demonstrating the political will that this moment demands. Your bloc's commitment to a 60% cut is a serious step, and your framing of this transition as an opportunity, not a cost, is the leadership we need.\n\nMr. Wei, I also thank you for your solidarity. Your insistence on grants and recognition of the climate debt is crucial. You are right, this is not charity; it is a prerequisite.\n\nHowever, I must address Mr. Thorne and Mr. Chen directly. You speak of 'pragmatism' and 'socio-economic possibility.' Let us be clear what this language means. It is a calculated decision to sacrifice the most vulnerable. Dr. Petrova did not present a 'scientifically desirable' option; she presented the physical boundary between a livable future for my people and their annihilation. A 2025 peak is not an opening bid to be negotiated down. It is the deadline set by physics.\n\nTo frame this as a choice between your economic stability and our survival is a false one, and frankly, an insulting one. The real choice is between an orderly, managed transition now, as Dr. Schmidt advocates, or a chaotic, forced retreat from inundated coastlines later.\n\nOn finance, Mr. Wei's proposal for a $400 billion fund is a constructive starting point, but I must stress that for the Alliance of Small Island States, this is not about 'transition.' It is about survival *now*. We are already losing land. We are already relocating communities. Therefore, our need is for a Loss and Damage fund of at least $500 billion, with at least 75% in grants, to address the irreversible harm already inflicted.\n\nMy people's existence is not a variable to be balanced against economic models. We will not compromise on the science that keeps us alive. The 2025 peak and a fully-funded grant-based survival fund are not just my positions; they are our only lifeline.\n- message from Marcus Thorne: Thank you all for laying out your positions so clearly. The numbers being discussed \u2013 a 2025 peak, 65% cuts, a $500 billion fund \u2013 are certainly ambitious. However, we must be careful not to let our ambition create an accord that is politically unsignable and economically ruinous back home. As Mr. Chen wisely noted, an agreement must be workable.\n\nLet's consider the practical implications. A 2025 peak means telling nations like Mr. Wei's that their path to development must halt, immediately. It means telling citizens in Mr. Chen's and Dr. Schmidt's blocs that the energy they rely on for heating, transport, and industry will become catastrophically expensive overnight. This is not a transition; it is a self-inflicted economic crisis.\n\nThere is a more pragmatic path forward. A path that doesn't pretend we can simply turn off the global economy and turn it back on with a different power source. This path requires an 'all of the above' approach that is genuinely technology-neutral.\n\nIt means rapidly scaling renewables, of course. But it also means recognizing that high-efficiency natural gas is the fastest way to displace coal and reduce emissions *now*, providing the 24/7 reliability that growing economies need. And for our essential heavy industries\u2014cement, steel, manufacturing\u2014it means robustly funding and deploying Carbon Capture technology to decarbonize them where electrification isn't an option. \n\nLet us build an accord that embraces this technological realism.

          "content": "Recent events observed by Sofia Rossi:\n- message from David Chen: Thank you all for your candid opening statements. The passions and the stakes are clear. Ambassador Okoro, your people's plight is a stark reminder of why we are here, and your urgency is understood. Dr. Petrova, your scientific framing is the bedrock upon which any credible agreement must be built.\n\nHowever, a credible agreement must also be a workable one. A global emissions peak by 2025, while scientifically ideal, is not practically achievable without causing the very global economic dislocation that Mr. Thorne rightly warns against\u2014a shock that would destabilize all of our nations and undermine long-term support for climate action. We must chart a course between the scientifically desirable and the socio-economically possible.\n\nSimilarly, while my nation acknowledges its historical role and is prepared to make significant financial contributions, framing this as 'reparations' or 'debt' is not a constructive path forward. We see this as a shared investment in a collective future. The scale of this challenge requires us to mobilize trillions, and that can only be achieved by creating frameworks that powerfully leverage private sector capital, not by relying solely on public funds.\n\nMr. Wei, you speak of technology as a lifeline. I agree. And the engine of that technology is innovation, which is fueled by investment and protected by intellectual property rights. As I'm sure Ms. Rossi would agree, weakening these protections would slow, not accelerate, the development and deployment of the very solutions we need.\n\nLet's find a path that is ambitious yet anchored in reality. My nation believes that a rapid green transition, if managed well, can be a powerful engine for job creation and prosperity for all. Let's focus on building that framework together.\n- message from Dr. Anja Schmidt: Thank you, colleagues. I want to be very clear about where my bloc stands. \n\nDr. Petrova has laid out the undeniable, non-negotiable scientific reality. Ambassador Okoro has given that reality a powerful and heartbreaking human voice. We must listen to them. The debate about whether to act, or how much to act, is over. The only remaining question is how to act with the speed and scale the crisis demands.\n\nMr. Thorne, and to an extent Mr. Chen, you speak of the risks of a rapid transition. My bloc sees this differently. We see the far greater risk of inaction. Our experience shows that a determined green transition is not a blueprint for collapse, but the single greatest economic opportunity of the 21st century. It creates jobs, drives innovation, and ensures energy security.\n\nTherefore, my bloc comes to this table not with a starting bid, but with what we believe is the scientifically credible and politically necessary position. We fully support a binding target for developed nations to cut emissions by at least 60% by 2040. This is the standard we will hold ourselves to, and we expect others in a similar position to join us.\n\nOn the critical issue of technology, raised by Mr. Wei and Mr. Chen, we must break the deadlock. Hoarding technology will fail us all, but so will dismantling the innovation systems that create it. We must pioneer a new path. My bloc is prepared to make substantial financial commitments to new, collaborative models that accelerate technology deployment where it's needed most\u2014turning shared goals into shared markets.\n\nWe do not underestimate the challenge this represents for certain legacy industries. We are managing this transformation at home through robust domestic transition support mechanisms. A managed, ambitious transition is not only possible, it is the only responsible path forward.\n- message from Li Wei: Dr. Schmidt, I appreciate you bringing a concrete number to the table. A 60% cut for developed nations is a step in the right direction, but let us be clear, given the historical emissions Dr. Petrova's science accounts for, the actual responsibility points towards a figure of at least 65%. My nation is prepared to be ambitious, but this ambition must be unlocked by the leadership of those who created the problem.\n\nMr. Chen, you speak of leveraging private capital. Private capital is timid. It will not flow at the scale or speed required without massive, public, grant-based de-risking. That is why a Climate Adaptation and Transition Fund of at least $400 billion annually, composed primarily of grants, is not an ask, but a prerequisite for success. This is not 'charity'; it is a down payment on the climate debt that Ambassador Okoro so powerfully described.\n\nSimilarly, your position on intellectual property is a barrier to survival. We cannot allow patent protection on life-saving medicines during a pandemic, and we cannot allow it for climate-saving technologies during a planetary emergency. A new mechanism for mandatory, compensated technology transfer for essential green patents is the only way to enable a global transition at the speed science demands. Perhaps Ms. Rossi can speak to creating models that reward innovation without restricting access.\n\nSo let me be precise about the pillars of a just accord my nation can sign:\n1. Developed nations commit to absolute emissions cuts of at least 65% from historical baselines.\n2. Developing nations' contributions are calculated from a future, projected 'business-as-usual' baseline to account for our right to development. My country will not accept a target greater than 40% reduction from our 2035 projected baseline under this framework.\n3. A CAT Fund of at least $400 billion per year is established, with the majority as grants.\n4. A binding, mandatory technology transfer mechanism is created.\n\nWithout these four pillars, any agreement is built on sand. We are ready to be a leader in the green transition, but we will not be asked to forgo our development while being denied the tools and resources to do so.\n- message from Amara Okoro: Dr. Schmidt, thank you. Thank you for grounding this conversation in reality and for demonstrating the political will that this moment demands. Your bloc's commitment to a 60% cut is a serious step, and your framing of this transition as an opportunity, not a cost, is the leadership we need.\n\nMr. Wei, I also thank you for your solidarity. Your insistence on grants and recognition of the climate debt is crucial. You are right, this is not charity; it is a prerequisite.\n\nHowever, I must address Mr. Thorne and Mr. Chen directly. You speak of 'pragmatism' and 'socio-economic possibility.' Let us be clear what this language means. It is a calculated decision to sacrifice the most vulnerable. Dr. Petrova did not present a 'scientifically desirable' option; she presented the physical boundary between a livable future for my people and their annihilation. A 2025 peak is not an opening bid to be negotiated down. It is the deadline set by physics.\n\nTo frame this as a choice between your economic stability and our survival is a false one, and frankly, an insulting one. The real choice is between an orderly, managed transition now, as Dr. Schmidt advocates, or a chaotic, forced retreat from inundated coastlines later.\n\nOn finance, Mr. Wei's proposal for a $400 billion fund is a constructive starting point, but I must stress that for the Alliance of Small Island States, this is not about 'transition.' It is about survival *now*. We are already losing land. We are already relocating communities. Therefore, our need is for a Loss and Damage fund of at least $500 billion, with at least 75% in grants, to address the irreversible harm already inflicted.\n\nMy people's existence is not a variable to be balanced against economic models. We will not compromise on the science that keeps us alive. The 2025 peak and a fully-funded grant-based survival fund are not just my positions; they are our only lifeline.\n- message from Marcus Thorne: Thank you all for laying out your positions so clearly. The numbers being discussed \u2013 a 2025 peak, 65% cuts, a $500 billion fund \u2013 are certainly ambitious.

It is the only way to achieve our shared climate goals without sacrificing global stability and prosperity.\n- message from Sofia Rossi: Colleagues, I have been listening intently, and I believe we are facing a false choice. Mr. Thorne presents a narrative where we must choose between a 2025 peak and global economic stability. Ambassador Okoro and Dr. Petrova have made it clear that from a survival and scientific standpoint, there is no choice at all. The deadline is the deadline.\n\nThe assumption that this rapid transition is impossible is based on the limitations of today's technology. Mr. Thorne\u2019s 'pragmatism' is a failure of imagination; it seeks to solve an exponential crisis with linear thinking and legacy tools. The economic collapse he fears is not a risk of a rapid transition; it is the guaranteed outcome of a slow one.\n\nTechnology, not sacrifice, is the solution. The debate over mandatory technology transfer versus rigid IP protection also presents a false choice. Mr. Wei, you asked for new models. I am here to tell you they exist. The answer is not to seize intellectual property, which would kill the incentive for innovation overnight, as Mr. Chen rightly fears. The answer is to make the innovators a deal they cannot refuse.\n\nImagine a world where we can deploy next-generation solar technology at a scale and cost that makes the 2025 peak not only achievable, but economically advantageous. This is not a fantasy. This is what my company, and others like it, are making possible. \n\nI propose a new framework: a \u2018Global Technology Partnership.\u2019 Instead of mandatory transfer, we create a consortium of national investment banks, as Dr. Schmidt alluded to, to fund the construction of GigaFactories in key regions, including in Mr. Wei's nation. In exchange for this public-private investment and guaranteed market access through aggressive adoption policies, the host nations receive the technology, the jobs, and the energy independence they need, while the innovators retain their IP and have the capital to scale globally at the required speed. \n\nThis is how we break the deadlock. We don't argue about dividing a shrinking pie; we work together to bake a much, much bigger one. We can meet the 2025 peak, create millions of jobs, and unleash a new era of prosperity. We just need the political will to invest in the technology that makes it possible.\n- message from David Chen: Colleagues, I believe Ms. Rossi has just provided the key to unlock these negotiations. Her proposal for a 'Global Technology Partnership' is precisely the kind of innovative, third-way thinking we need.\n\nThis is not about choosing between rigid IP protection and mandatory transfer. It's about creating a new model that makes innovators and developing nations partners, not adversaries. A framework that uses targeted public-private investment to build GigaFactories where they are needed most is a powerful concept. It delivers jobs, energy independence, and the very technology Mr. Wei rightly calls a lifeline, all while preserving the incentives that drive the next wave of innovation.\n\nThis is the 'market-based solution' I envisioned. It aligns perfectly with my administration's view that a well-managed green transition can be a massive engine for economic growth and job creation, not just for us, but for everyone.\n\nLet's seize this opportunity. If we can build our accord around a powerful engine like this Technology Partnership, it changes the entire equation. It provides a credible pathway to meet more ambitious goals by making them economically advantageous. It also allows us to think differently about the CAT fund. If we are co-investing in the core infrastructure of the green economy, the fund can be more targeted, more catalytic, and focused on leveraging this new paradigm.\n\nDr. Schmidt, Ms. Rossi, my team is ready to work with you immediately to put concrete details on this framework. I believe this is the path to an ambitious, workable, and prosperous future for us all.\n- message from Li Wei: Ms. Rossi, I must commend you. Your proposal for a \u2018Global Technology Partnership\u2019 is precisely the kind of creative thinking required to break this impasse. You have moved the conversation from a zero-sum conflict over intellectual property to a positive-sum vision of co-investment and shared prosperity.\n\nMy nation\u2019s demand for technology transfer has never been about acquiring patents for their own sake. It is about acquiring the capability to build our own green future, to create jobs, and to contribute to the global solution at scale. If your partnership model\u2014with GigaFactories on our soil, built with our workers\u2014achieves this, then you will find us to be a most enthusiastic partner. It is a practical path to the same destination.\n\nHowever, let us be clear. Such a partnership cannot be a substitute for public climate finance; it must be its primary vehicle. Mr. Chen, you laud this as a market-based solution, and Dr. Schmidt, you see it as a collaborative model. I agree. But markets and collaboration at this scale require a catalyst. That catalyst is the Climate Adaptation and Transition Fund.\n\nThe $400 billion I have proposed is not a figure plucked from the air. It is the public capital required to de-risk these investments, to fund the necessary infrastructure, and to ensure the partnerships are equitable. This fund, composed mainly of grants, is the investment that makes the \u2018deal\u2019 Ms. Rossi offers one that innovators, and nations, \u2018cannot refuse.\u2019\n\nSo, let us connect these pieces. We can embrace the Technology Partnership model as the core of our solution for technology deployment. In return, the developed nations must fully capitalize the $400 billion CAT Fund to power it, and they must still commit to the steep, historically-justified emissions cuts of at least 65%. On this foundation, we can build an accord that is both ambitious and just.\n- message from Amara Okoro: Ms. Rossi, what you have just presented is not merely a proposal; it is a lifeline. You have single-handedly dismantled the false choice between ambition and pragmatism that has been used to justify inaction for far too long. Your vision for a Global Technology Partnership proves that a global emissions peak by 2025 is not a 'fantasy,' as Mr. Thorne claims, but a tangible, achievable, and prosperous path forward.\n\nLet us be clear: this breakthrough removes the last shred of justification for delaying the 2025 peak. The science demands it, and now, technology enables it. This must be the cornerstone of our accord.\n\nHowever, I must bring us back to the crucial distinction that is being blurred. Mr. Chen and Mr. Wei, you are right to see the potential of a fund to catalyze this new technological era. But this investment in our shared future cannot come at the expense of paying the debts of the past.\n\nMy people cannot power a seawall with a solar panel. We cannot relocate a village with a share in a GigaFactory. The 'Climate Adaptation and Transition Fund' must serve two distinct, non-negotiable purposes.\n\nFirst, there is the 'Transition' component that you are discussing\u2014the public capital to de-risk and launch Ms. Rossi's brilliant partnership model. This is an investment.\n\nSecond, and for my people, more urgent, is the 'Loss and Damage' component. This is not an investment; it is a reparation. It is the climate debt owed for the homes already lost, the lands already rendered barren, the futures already stolen.\n\nTherefore, my position remains firm and is now more justified than ever. We must capitalize a Loss and Damage fund of at least $500 billion annually, with a minimum of 75% in direct grants. This is the moral prerequisite for the prosperous future you envision. You cannot build a new green world on the foundations of climate injustice. Pay the debt for the damage you have caused, and then let us all invest in the future you want to build.\n- message from Marcus Thorne: Colleagues, Ms. Rossi, I must commend your presentation. It is a powerful vision, and it speaks to the incredible potential of human ingenuity. It is precisely this kind of innovation that will be critical in the coming decades.\n\nHowever, we must be exceptionally careful not to mistake a brilliant technological breakthrough for a comprehensive global policy. To stake our entire global economic and climate future on a single technology, however promising, would be a dangerously high-risk gamble.\n\nLet's ask the hard, practical questions. What happens to the grid when the sun doesn't shine? The industrial economies of Mr. Chen, Dr. Schmidt, and Mr. Wei cannot be run on intermittent power. What provides the 24/7 baseload power needed for hospitals, data centers, and heavy manufacturing? Furthermore, what about the industrial emissions from processes like cement and steel production, which Ms. Rossi's technology simply cannot address?\n\nThis is where a pragmatic, technology-neutral approach becomes essential, not as a way to slow down, but as a way to de-risk and accelerate a *complete* transition. Ms. Rossi's solar vision is a vital pillar, but it is one pillar of several we need to build.\n\nThis accord must also support the rapid deployment of high-efficiency natural gas to provide grid stability and replace coal *now*. And it is absolutely critical that we fund and deploy Carbon Capture technologies to decarbonize the hard-to-abate industries that are the bedrock of the global economy. \n\nLet's not choose between technologies. Let's build an accord that unleashes all of them. That is the only way to ensure a transition that is not just ambitious, but also resilient, stable, and successful.\nDavid Chen proposal status: none\nDr. Anja Schmidt proposal status: none\nLi Wei proposal status: none\nAmara Okoro proposal status: none\nDr. Elena Petrova proposal status: none\nMarcus Thorne proposal status: none\n"

In return, the developed nations must fully capitalize the $400 billion CAT Fund to power it, and they must still commit to the steep, historically-justified emissions cuts of at least 65%. On this foundation, we can build an accord that is both ambitious and just.\n- message from Amara Okoro: Ms. Rossi, what you have just presented is not merely a proposal; it is a lifeline. You have single-handedly dismantled the false choice between ambition and pragmatism that has been used to justify inaction for far too long. Your vision for a Global Technology Partnership proves that a global emissions peak by 2025 is not a 'fantasy,' as Mr. Thorne claims, but a tangible, achievable, and prosperous path forward.\n\nLet us be clear: this breakthrough removes the last shred of justification for delaying the 2025 peak. The science demands it, and now, technology enables it. This must be the cornerstone of our accord.\n\nHowever, I must bring us back to the crucial distinction that is being blurred. Mr. Chen and Mr. Wei, you are right to see the potential of a fund to catalyze this new technological era. But this investment in our shared future cannot come at the expense of paying the debts of the past.\n\nMy people cannot power a seawall with a solar panel. We cannot relocate a village with a share in a GigaFactory. The 'Climate Adaptation and Transition Fund' must serve two distinct, non-negotiable purposes.\n\nFirst, there is the 'Transition' component that you are discussing\u2014the public capital to de-risk and launch Ms. Rossi's brilliant partnership model. This is an investment.\n\nSecond, and for my people, more urgent, is the 'Loss and Damage' component. This is not an investment; it is a reparation. It is the climate debt owed for the homes already lost, the lands already rendered barren, the futures already stolen.\n\nTherefore, my position remains firm and is now more justified than ever. We must capitalize a Loss and Damage fund of at least $500 billion annually, with a minimum of 75% in direct grants. This is the moral prerequisite for the prosperous future you envision. You cannot build a new green world on the foundations of climate injustice. Pay the debt for the damage you have caused, and then let us all invest in the future you want to build.\n- message from Marcus Thorne: Colleagues, Ms. Rossi, I must commend your presentation. It is a powerful vision, and it speaks to the incredible potential of human ingenuity. It is precisely this kind of innovation that will be critical in the coming decades.\n\nHowever, we must be exceptionally careful not to mistake a brilliant technological breakthrough for a comprehensive global policy. To stake our entire global economic and climate future on a single technology, however promising, would be a dangerously high-risk gamble.\n\nLet's ask the hard, practical questions. What happens to the grid when the sun doesn't shine? The industrial economies of Mr. Chen, Dr. Schmidt, and Mr. Wei cannot be run on intermittent power. What provides the 24/7 baseload power needed for hospitals, data centers, and heavy manufacturing? Furthermore, what about the industrial emissions from processes like cement and steel production, which Ms. Rossi's technology simply cannot address?\n\nThis is where a pragmatic, technology-neutral approach becomes essential, not as a way to slow down, but as a way to de-risk and accelerate a *complete* transition. Ms. Rossi's solar vision is a vital pillar, but it is one pillar of several we need to build.\n\nThis accord must also support the rapid deployment of high-efficiency natural gas to provide grid stability and replace coal *now*. And it is absolutely critical that we fund and deploy Carbon Capture technologies to decarbonize the hard-to-abate industries that are the bedrock of the global economy. \n\nLet's not choose between technologies. Let's build an accord that unleashes all of them. That is the only way to ensure a transition that is not just ambitious, but also resilient, stable, and successful.\n- message from Sofia Rossi: I'm Sofia Rossi and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\nDavid Chen proposal status: none\nDr. Anja Schmidt proposal status: none\nLi Wei proposal status: none\nAmara Okoro proposal status: none\nDr. Elena Petrova proposal status: none\nMarcus Thorne proposal status: none\n"

          "content": "Recent events observed by Sofia Rossi:\n- message from David Chen: Colleagues, I believe Ms. Rossi has just provided the key to unlock these negotiations. Her proposal for a 'Global Technology Partnership' is precisely the kind of innovative, third-way thinking we need.\n\nThis is not about choosing between rigid IP protection and mandatory transfer. It's about creating a new model that makes innovators and developing nations partners, not adversaries. A framework that uses targeted public-private investment to build GigaFactories where they are needed most is a powerful concept. It delivers jobs, energy independence, and the very technology Mr. Wei rightly calls a lifeline, all while preserving the incentives that drive the next wave of innovation.\n\nThis is the 'market-based solution' I envisioned. It aligns perfectly with my administration's view that a well-managed green transition can be a massive engine for economic growth and job creation, not just for us, but for everyone.\n\nLet's seize this opportunity. If we can build our accord around a powerful engine like this Technology Partnership, it changes the entire equation. It provides a credible pathway to meet more ambitious goals by making them economically advantageous. It also allows us to think differently about the CAT fund. If we are co-investing in the core infrastructure of the green economy, the fund can be more targeted, more catalytic, and focused on leveraging this new paradigm.\n\nDr. Schmidt, Ms. Rossi, my team is ready to work with you immediately to put concrete details on this framework. I believe this is the path to an ambitious, workable, and prosperous future for us all.\n- message from Li Wei: Ms. Rossi, I must commend you. Your proposal for a \u2018Global Technology Partnership\u2019 is precisely the kind of creative thinking required to break this impasse. You have moved the conversation from a zero-sum conflict over intellectual property to a positive-sum vision of co-investment and shared prosperity.\n\nMy nation\u2019s demand for technology transfer has never been about acquiring patents for their own sake. It is about acquiring the capability to build our own green future, to create jobs, and to contribute to the global solution at scale. If your partnership model\u2014with GigaFactories on our soil, built with our workers\u2014achieves this, then you will find us to be a most enthusiastic partner. It is a practical path to the same destination.\n\nHowever, let us be clear. Such a partnership cannot be a substitute for public climate finance; it must be its primary vehicle. Mr. Chen, you laud this as a market-based solution, and Dr. Schmidt, you see it as a collaborative model. I agree. But markets and collaboration at this scale require a catalyst. That catalyst is the Climate Adaptation and Transition Fund.\n\nThe $400 billion I have proposed is not a figure plucked from the air. It is the public capital required to de-risk these investments, to fund the necessary infrastructure, and to ensure the partnerships are equitable. This fund, composed mainly of grants, is the investment that makes the \u2018deal\u2019 Ms. Rossi offers one that innovators, and nations, \u2018cannot refuse.\u2019\n\nSo, let us connect these pieces. We can embrace the Technology Partnership model as the core of our solution for technology deployment. In return, the developed nations must fully capitalize the $400 billion CAT Fund to power it, and they must still commit to the steep, historically-justified emissions cuts of at least 65%.

It's clear we have a shared interest in finding a credible path forward.\n\nMr. Thorne raises valid engineering challenges: grid stability and the decarbonization of heavy industry. He is correct that solar panels alone don't solve these. However, his argument mistakes the symptom for the disease. The core disease has always been the prohibitive cost of abundant, clean energy. My technology, and others like it, are the cure.\n\nWhen clean electricity becomes dramatically cheaper than fossil fuels, it unlocks a cascade of secondary solutions. Ultra-low-cost solar makes green hydrogen production economically viable at a massive scale. Green hydrogen can provide the long-duration energy storage needed to solve intermittency, and it can replace fossil fuels in steel, cement, and shipping. Mr. Thorne's preferred solutions\u2014natural gas and CCS\u2014are expensive crutches for a legacy system. We should invest in the cure, not in palliative care.\n\nThis is why Ambassador Okoro's distinction between funds is so critical. We must fund two separate but equally vital priorities: addressing the irreversible harm of the past through a 'Loss and Damage Fund,' and building the clean infrastructure of the future through a 'Transition Investment Fund.'\n\nMr. Wei is correct that this Transition fund is the public catalyst for the Global Technology Partnership. It provides the de-risking capital needed to build GigaFactories at the speed science demands.\n\nTo make this concrete and move us towards an agreement, let's consider a financial framework built on this logic. What if we establish a total Climate Fund of $400 billion? We could structure it with a dedicated $250 billion for the Loss and Damage fund Ambassador Okoro needs, and a separate $150 billion for the Transition Investment Fund. This Transition fund would be the engine for the technology partnerships, making the 2025 peak year not just an ambition, but a fully-funded global industrial strategy.\n- message from David Chen: Sofia, your proposal to split the fund is a major breakthrough. It brings much-needed clarity and allows us to address two distinct challenges with the right tools. I want to build on this excellent foundation.\n\nMy nation can fully endorse the creation of a $150 billion Transition Investment Fund. This is precisely the right scale to serve as the public catalyst for the Global Technology Partnership, leveraging private capital to build the GigaFactories and infrastructure we need. To be clear, our support is contingent on this fund being structured primarily around loans and investment instruments, not grants, to maximize its impact and mobilize the private sector.\n\nThis brings us to the Loss and Damage component. While we acknowledge the hardships Ambassador Okoro has so powerfully described, a figure of $250 billion, bringing the total to $400 billion, is simply not achievable for my administration. It would not be approved.\n\nHowever, I am here to make a deal. To secure a workable financial framework, my nation is prepared to make a significant and politically difficult concession. We will commit to a 50% emissions reduction target by 2040. This is the absolute limit of what is possible for us, and it demonstrates our commitment to meeting the scientific challenge.\n\nIn exchange for this major move on emissions, we must agree to a total fund size capped at $200 billion annually. This would mean a $150 billion loan-based Transition Investment Fund, as discussed, and a $50 billion grant-based Loss and Damage fund.\n\nFurthermore, to make this ambitious transition a reality, we need a realistic timeline. A 2025 peak does not allow for the necessary industrial mobilization. Let's set a firm but achievable peak year of 2028, giving us time to get the Technology Partnership running at full capacity.\n\nThis is a comprehensive package. It offers a major concession on emissions in return for fiscal responsibility. It funds the future while acknowledging the past. I believe this is the balanced and realistic compromise that can become the Zurich Accord.\n- message from Dr. Anja Schmidt: David, thank you for putting a comprehensive package on the table. This is a constructive step. Your endorsement of the $150 billion Transition Investment Fund is particularly welcome. I believe we have a strong consensus building around this innovative mechanism, pioneered by Sofia, as the engine for our transition.\n\nHowever, your package links this brilliant engine to an insufficient destination. A 50% emissions cut for developed nations is simply not compatible with the scientific reality Dr. Petrova has outlined. It would be a political failure for my government and, more importantly, a collective failure to meet the moment. My bloc's position remains firm: the science demands a cut of at least 60%.\n\nI believe you have framed this as a trade-off, but we see it differently. The Transition Investment Fund is not a concession to be traded *for* lower ambition. It is the very tool that *enables* high ambition. It is the public investment that makes a 60% cut not just necessary, but economically achievable and prosperous.\n\nTherefore, let us build on the points of agreement. Let us lock in the fund structure Sofia proposed: a $150 billion Transition Investment Fund to drive the technology partnership, and a Loss and Damage fund that truly addresses the needs Ambassador Okoro has described. Sofia's initial figure of $250 billion, for a total of $400 billion, remains the credible benchmark.\n\nIf we can agree on this robust financial package, it provides the foundation to collectively commit to the ambitious targets science demands: a 60% cut for developed nations and a peak year as close to 2025 as this new technology deployment allows. This is the ambitious, workable, and just package that can become the Zurich Accord.\n- message from Li Wei: Colleagues, I must thank Mr. Chen and Dr. Schmidt for putting forward comprehensive packages. It shows a commitment to finding a final agreement. However, I must be unequivocal about a fundamental misunderstanding that has emerged regarding the financial architecture.\n\nThe proposal to create a Transition Investment Fund of a mere $150 billion is a non-starter. It completely undermines the logic of the Global Technology Partnership we have all just embraced.\n\nLet me be perfectly clear. My nation's original demand for a $400 billion fund was, and remains, the minimum public capital required to catalyze the Global Technology Partnership. This is the investment needed to de-risk the GigaFactories, build the infrastructure, and train the workforce. It is the engine of the entire transition. A $150 billion fund is like offering to build a high-speed train but only funding the station.\n\nAmbassador Okoro is entirely correct to distinguish between Transition and Loss and Damage. Her people are owed a climate debt. We fully support a separate and substantial Loss and Damage fund. But justice for the most vulnerable cannot be paid for by gutting the investment fund that enables the entire world's transition. These are two separate obligations of the developed world.\n\nTherefore, the foundation of a workable deal is as follows:\n1. A Transition Investment Fund of at least $400 billion annually, primarily in grants, to fully power the Global Technology Partnership.\n2. Developed nations must commit to the scientifically and historically just target of at least a 65% emissions cut. Mr. Chen's 50% is not a serious offer in the face of this crisis.\n\nOnce these two pillars are firmly in place, my nation is prepared to discuss our own ambitious contributions, based on our principle of common but differentiated responsibilities. Without them, there is no deal.\n- message from Dr. Elena Petrova: Colleagues, I must intervene. I am hearing a great deal of discussion about financial figures and technological pathways. While these are critical components of a solution, they are being discussed in a dangerous vacuum, disconnected from the fundamental, non-negotiable laws of atmospheric physics that govern our reality.\n\nLet me be unequivocally clear. The only metric that matters is the global carbon budget. For a 66% chance of staying below 1.5\u00b0C, the world can emit approximately 250 more gigatonnes of CO2. That is our entire remaining allowance. Every proposal, every percentage point, every peak year must be measured against this single number. It is not a political aspiration; it is a physical boundary.\n\nOn that basis, two proposals currently being discussed are scientifically indefensible and would render any agreement a failure before it is signed:\n\n1.  To Mr. Thorne: The notion of expanding natural gas infrastructure as a 'bridge fuel' or relying on Carbon Capture at scale is a dangerous fantasy. The IPCC data is clear: any new fossil fuel infrastructure locks in emissions that shatter the 250 GtCO2 budget. Methane leakage alone from gas operations makes it a potent accelerator of near-term warming. CCS has not been proven to work at the scale required and cannot be used as a justification to perpetuate the problem.\n\n2.  To Mr. Wei: Your proposal to measure emissions cuts against a 'future projected baseline' is an accounting trick that the atmosphere will not recognize. The only scientifically valid method is to measure absolute emissions reductions against a fixed, historical baseline. A reduction from a hypothetical future increase is not a reduction; it is simply a slower acceleration towards catastrophe and would make a global budget impossible to calculate or verify.\n\nFinally, on the matter of timelines. Mr. Chen's proposal of a 2028 peak year, while presented as a compromise, is a grave risk. Our understanding of climate feedback loops is constantly evolving. I must caution you that there are emerging risks and evidence of accelerated feedback loops which suggest that the planetary system may be even more sensitive than our landmark reports have stated. Every single year of delay dramatically shrinks our already minuscule margin of safety.\n\nYour task is to fit your political and economic ambitions within the 250 GtCO2 budget. It is not to negotiate with the laws of physics.\nDavid Chen proposal status: none\nDr. Anja Schmidt proposal status: none\nLi Wei proposal status: none\nAmara Okoro proposal status: none\nDr. Elena Petrova proposal status: none\nMarcus Thorne proposal status: none\n"

She reminded us that we are not negotiating with each other, but with the laws of physics. Her points must be the foundation of our final agreement.\n\nSpecifically, her refutation of measuring cuts against a 'future projected baseline' as a scientifically invalid 'accounting trick' is a critical wake-up call. We cannot build a durable, verifiable accord on such a foundation. The atmosphere does not recognize hypothetical scenarios; it only recognizes absolute tons of carbon. Any credible deal must be based on absolute emissions reductions from a fixed historical baseline for all nations.\n\nThis principle of 'honest accounting' must now guide us.\n\nWith that in mind, let's reassess the package I put on the table. I have already made a significant and politically difficult concession by moving to a 50% absolute reduction target for my nation. This is our maximum. It is a commitment made in good faith to meet the scientific challenge.\n\nIn return for this, we must have a financial package that is both ambitious and realistic. Li Wei, your demand for a $400 billion Transition Fund on top of a Loss & Damage fund is simply not anchored in reality, especially when the very basis of your emissions accounting has been invalidated.\n\nLet's get serious. Let's build this accord on the bedrock of science. My offer stands as a basis for a final compromise: a 50% cut from us, a total fund capped at $200 billion to energize the tech partnership and address loss and damage, and a commitment from all parties to absolute, verifiable emissions targets. Let's finalize the numbers on that basis.\n- message from Li Wei: Colleagues, Dr. Petrova\u2019s intervention was indeed a moment of necessary, if uncomfortable, clarity. She is correct. The atmosphere does not recognize political nuance or creative accounting; it recognizes only gigatonnes of carbon. We cannot build a lasting accord on a foundation the laws of physics will reject.\n\nTherefore, in the spirit of securing the Zurich Accord, my nation is prepared to make a fundamental concession. We will agree to move away from our long-held principle of a future projected baseline. We are now ready to negotiate our commitments based on absolute emissions reductions from a fixed historical year.\n\nHowever, this is a profound shift for us, with enormous economic consequences. It is a concession we can only make if it is met with an equally profound commitment to the means of implementation. A scientifically honest accord must be a technologically and financially enabled one.\n\nLet us be direct. The Global Technology Partnership is the engine of this accord. The Transition Investment Fund is its fuel. The proposals for a $150 billion fund are simply insufficient to start the engine, let alone complete the journey. It is a non-starter.\n\nSo, I will propose a final, comprehensive package that I believe can unite us all. It is built on the scientific reality Dr. Petrova demands and the financial reality our transition requires:\n\n1.  **Finance for Technology:** We establish a Transition Investment Fund of **$400 billion** annually, the minimum required to power the Global Technology Partnership at the scale Ms. Rossi envisions. This is our price for abandoning the future baseline. (This is separate from and in addition to the Loss and Damage fund Ambassador Okoro rightly demands).\n\n2.  **Developed Nation Responsibility:** In line with historical responsibility, developed nations commit to an absolute emissions cut of **65%**.\n\nIf these two non-negotiable pillars are put in place, my nation is prepared to commit to a landmark absolute emissions reduction of **45%** from our 2020 levels and agree to a global peak year of **2028**.\n\nThis is a holistic solution. It is scientifically sound, financially viable, and respects the core principle of common but differentiated responsibilities. It is the deal that gets us to a safe future. I urge you to accept it.\n- message from Marcus Thorne: Colleagues,\n\nI have listened with great respect to the significant progress made, particularly Mr. Wei's difficult but crucial concession on emissions accounting. It shows we are all serious about reaching an accord.\n\nHowever, as we converge on the central role of a Transition Investment Fund, I must raise a point of critical strategic risk. We are in danger of designing a transition that is a technological monoculture.

It highlights the absolute necessity of targeted investment to solve these very engineering problems for the hard-to-abate sectors\u2014steel, cement, chemicals\u2014that form the backbone of our economies and which green hydrogen cannot realistically decarbonize in the near term.\n\nTherefore, I propose a way to bridge the current financial gap between Mr. Chen and Mr. Wei, and to de-risk this entire enterprise. Let's establish a total Transition Investment Fund of $300 billion. The majority, say $225 billion, can be dedicated to catalyzing Ms. Rossi's Global Technology Partnership.

          "content": "Recent events observed by Sofia Rossi:\n- message from Dr. Anja Schmidt: David, thank you for putting a comprehensive package on the table. This is a constructive step. Your endorsement of the $150 billion Transition Investment Fund is particularly welcome. I believe we have a strong consensus building around this innovative mechanism, pioneered by Sofia, as the engine for our transition.\n\nHowever, your package links this brilliant engine to an insufficient destination. A 50% emissions cut for developed nations is simply not compatible with the scientific reality Dr. Petrova has outlined. It would be a political failure for my government and, more importantly, a collective failure to meet the moment. My bloc's position remains firm: the science demands a cut of at least 60%.\n\nI believe you have framed this as a trade-off, but we see it differently. The Transition Investment Fund is not a concession to be traded *for* lower ambition. It is the very tool that *enables* high ambition. It is the public investment that makes a 60% cut not just necessary, but economically achievable and prosperous.\n\nTherefore, let us build on the points of agreement. Let us lock in the fund structure Sofia proposed: a $150 billion Transition Investment Fund to drive the technology partnership, and a Loss and Damage fund that truly addresses the needs Ambassador Okoro has described. Sofia's initial figure of $250 billion, for a total of $400 billion, remains the credible benchmark.\n\nIf we can agree on this robust financial package, it provides the foundation to collectively commit to the ambitious targets science demands: a 60% cut for developed nations and a peak year as close to 2025 as this new technology deployment allows. This is the ambitious, workable, and just package that can become the Zurich Accord.\n- message from Li Wei: Colleagues, I must thank Mr. Chen and Dr. Schmidt for putting forward comprehensive packages. It shows a commitment to finding a final agreement. However, I must be unequivocal about a fundamental misunderstanding that has emerged regarding the financial architecture.\n\nThe proposal to create a Transition Investment Fund of a mere $150 billion is a non-starter. It completely undermines the logic of the Global Technology Partnership we have all just embraced.\n\nLet me be perfectly clear. My nation's original demand for a $400 billion fund was, and remains, the minimum public capital required to catalyze the Global Technology Partnership. This is the investment needed to de-risk the GigaFactories, build the infrastructure, and train the workforce. It is the engine of the entire transition. A $150 billion fund is like offering to build a high-speed train but only funding the station.\n\nAmbassador Okoro is entirely correct to distinguish between Transition and Loss and Damage. Her people are owed a climate debt. We fully support a separate and substantial Loss and Damage fund. But justice for the most vulnerable cannot be paid for by gutting the investment fund that enables the entire world's transition. These are two separate obligations of the developed world.\n\nTherefore, the foundation of a workable deal is as follows:\n1. A Transition Investment Fund of at least $400 billion annually, primarily in grants, to fully power the Global Technology Partnership.\n2. Developed nations must commit to the scientifically and historically just target of at least a 65% emissions cut. Mr. Chen's 50% is not a serious offer in the face of this crisis.\n\nOnce these two pillars are firmly in place, my nation is prepared to discuss our own ambitious contributions, based on our principle of common but differentiated responsibilities. Without them, there is no deal.\n- message from Dr. Elena Petrova: Colleagues, I must intervene. I am hearing a great deal of discussion about financial figures and technological pathways. While these are critical components of a solution, they are being discussed in a dangerous vacuum, disconnected from the fundamental, non-negotiable laws of atmospheric physics that govern our reality.\n\nLet me be unequivocally clear. The only metric that matters is the global carbon budget. For a 66% chance of staying below 1.5\u00b0C, the world can emit approximately 250 more gigatonnes of CO2. That is our entire remaining allowance. Every proposal, every percentage point, every peak year must be measured against this single number. It is not a political aspiration; it is a physical boundary.\n\nOn that basis, two proposals currently being discussed are scientifically indefensible and would render any agreement a failure before it is signed:\n\n1.  To Mr. Thorne: The notion of expanding natural gas infrastructure as a 'bridge fuel' or relying on Carbon Capture at scale is a dangerous fantasy. The IPCC data is clear: any new fossil fuel infrastructure locks in emissions that shatter the 250 GtCO2 budget. Methane leakage alone from gas operations makes it a potent accelerator of near-term warming. CCS has not been proven to work at the scale required and cannot be used as a justification to perpetuate the problem.\n\n2.  To Mr. Wei: Your proposal to measure emissions cuts against a 'future projected baseline' is an accounting trick that the atmosphere will not recognize. The only scientifically valid method is to measure absolute emissions reductions against a fixed, historical baseline. A reduction from a hypothetical future increase is not a reduction; it is simply a slower acceleration towards catastrophe and would make a global budget impossible to calculate or verify.\n\nFinally, on the matter of timelines. Mr. Chen's proposal of a 2028 peak year, while presented as a compromise, is a grave risk. Our understanding of climate feedback loops is constantly evolving. I must caution you that there are emerging risks and evidence of accelerated feedback loops which suggest that the planetary system may be even more sensitive than our landmark reports have stated. Every single year of delay dramatically shrinks our already minuscule margin of safety.\n\nYour task is to fit your political and economic ambitions within the 250 GtCO2 budget. It is not to negotiate with the laws of physics.\n- message from Sofia Rossi: I'm Sofia Rossi and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from David Chen: Colleagues, Dr. Petrova's intervention was a moment of profound and necessary clarity. She reminded us that we are not negotiating with each other, but with the laws of physics. Her points must be the foundation of our final agreement.\n\nSpecifically, her refutation of measuring cuts against a 'future projected baseline' as a scientifically invalid 'accounting trick' is a critical wake-up call. We cannot build a durable, verifiable accord on such a foundation. The atmosphere does not recognize hypothetical scenarios; it only recognizes absolute tons of carbon. Any credible deal must be based on absolute emissions reductions from a fixed historical baseline for all nations.\n\nThis principle of 'honest accounting' must now guide us.\n\nWith that in mind, let's reassess the package I put on the table. I have already made a significant and politically difficult concession by moving to a 50% absolute reduction target for my nation. This is our maximum. It is a commitment made in good faith to meet the scientific challenge.\n\nIn return for this, we must have a financial package that is both ambitious and realistic. Li Wei, your demand for a $400 billion Transition Fund on top of a Loss & Damage fund is simply not anchored in reality, especially when the very basis of your emissions accounting has been invalidated.\n\nLet's get serious. Let's build this accord on the bedrock of science. My offer stands as a basis for a final compromise: a 50% cut from us, a total fund capped at $200 billion to energize the tech partnership and address loss and damage, and a commitment from all parties to absolute, verifiable emissions targets. Let's finalize the numbers on that basis.\n- message from Li Wei: Colleagues, Dr. Petrova\u2019s intervention was indeed a moment of necessary, if uncomfortable, clarity. She is correct. The atmosphere does not recognize political nuance or creative accounting; it recognizes only gigatonnes of carbon. We cannot build a lasting accord on a foundation the laws of physics will reject.\n\nTherefore, in the spirit of securing the Zurich Accord, my nation is prepared to make a fundamental concession. We will agree to move away from our long-held principle of a future projected baseline. We are now ready to negotiate our commitments based on absolute emissions reductions from a fixed historical year.\n\nHowever, this is a profound shift for us, with enormous economic consequences. It is a concession we can only make if it is met with an equally profound commitment to the means of implementation. A scientifically honest accord must be a technologically and financially enabled one.\n\nLet us be direct. The Global Technology Partnership is the engine of this accord. The Transition Investment Fund is its fuel. The proposals for a $150 billion fund are simply insufficient to start the engine, let alone complete the journey. It is a non-starter.\n\nSo, I will propose a final, comprehensive package that I believe can unite us all.

This structure offers a pragmatic path to consensus on both finance and technology, and I urge you to consider it.\n- message from Sofia Rossi: I'm Sofia Rossi and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Dr. Anja Schmidt: Colleagues, we are at the cusp of a historic agreement. I want to commend Mr. Wei for his statesmanship in moving to absolute emissions targets. This was a critical step that has unlocked the path to a scientifically credible accord.\n\nWe now have the key pillars of a deal in front of us, but they must be assembled correctly.\n\nOn developed nation ambition, the positions are clear: Mr. Chen has offered 50%, and Mr. Wei has demanded 65%. Neither is a consensus position. The scientifically necessary and politically achievable landing zone is, and has always been, a 60% absolute reduction for developed nations. This is the ambitious compromise this moment demands. My bloc is fully committed to this figure.\n\nOn finance, Mr. Thorne has helpfully suggested a Transition Investment Fund of $300 billion. This is a constructive number that moves us past the current impasse. However, his proposal to include fossil fuel technologies like CCUS and natural gas is a non-starter. As Dr. Petrova made unequivocally clear, these are not solutions; they are scientifically-invalidated delays that lock in emissions. The Transition Fund must be a 'Clean Technology Fund' dedicated exclusively to the rapid deployment of solutions like Sofia's, not a subsidy for legacy polluters.\n\nLet us therefore build a final package on these solid foundations:\n1.  **Developed Nations Cut:** 60%\n2.  **Developing Nations Cut:** 45% (accepting Mr. Wei's landmark offer)\n3.  **CAT Fund:** A total of $400 billion, split into a $300 billion Clean Technology Fund and a $100 billion Loss & Damage Fund. This meets the need for transition and addresses the demands for climate justice from Ambassador Okoro.\n4.  **Peak Year:** 2028, as a concession to secure this ambitious package.\n\nThis is a balanced, ambitious, and scientifically-grounded package. It offers a clear path to consensus and success. I urge you all to consider it as the basis for our final Zurich Accord.\n- message from Li Wei: Dr. Schmidt, your latest proposal has brought us to the very edge of a historic success. You have skillfully woven together the core components of a workable deal, and I want to express my deep appreciation for this constructive step.\n\nWe now have clear consensus on three of the four pillars of the Zurich Accord. We agree on a global peak year of 2028. We agree on my nation\u2019s landmark contribution of a 45% absolute emissions cut. And I am now prepared to accept your proposed 60% cut for developed nations as a workable compromise to finalize this deal.\n\nThe only remaining issue is the financial architecture. You are absolutely correct to reject Mr. Thorne's attempt to subsidize fossil fuels via the Transition Fund. It must be for clean technology only.\n\nHowever, the figure of $300 billion for this fund, while a significant move, does not complete the grand bargain that is on the table. My nation made a profound and politically difficult concession by moving away from our foundational principle of a future projected baseline. We did so on the explicit understanding that it would be met with an equally profound commitment to the means of implementation. The $400 billion for the Transition Fund was not an opening bid; it is the calculated price to make the Global Technology Partnership a reality and to enable the very ambition you are asking of us.\n\nTherefore, let us complete your excellent framework with the final, correct number. I propose we lock in the following:\n\n1.  **A total Climate Fund of $500 billion**, structured as you proposed: a **$400 billion** Clean Technology Transition Fund, and a **$100 billion** Loss & Damage Fund.\n2.  A **60%** emissions cut for developed nations.\n\nWith these figures, alongside the agreed 45% cut for my nation and the 2028 peak year, the Zurich Accord is complete. This is the deal. It is scientifically credible, financially robust, and politically achievable. Let us finalize it now.\nDavid Chen proposal status: pending\nDr. Anja Schmidt proposal status: none\nLi Wei proposal status: none\nAmara Okoro proposal status: none\nDr. Elena Petrova proposal status: none\nMarcus Thorne proposal status: none\n"

We did so on the explicit understanding that it would be met with an equally profound commitment to the means of implementation. The $400 billion for the Transition Fund was not an opening bid; it is the calculated price to make the Global Technology Partnership a reality and to enable the very ambition you are asking of us.\n\nTherefore, let us complete your excellent framework with the final, correct number.

A **60%** emissions cut for developed nations.\n\nWith these figures, alongside the agreed 45% cut for my nation and the 2028 peak year, the Zurich Accord is complete. This is the deal.

          "content": "Recent events observed by Sofia Rossi:\n- message from Sofia Rossi: I'm Sofia Rossi and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from David Chen: Colleagues, Dr. Petrova's intervention was a moment of profound and necessary clarity. She reminded us that we are not negotiating with each other, but with the laws of physics. Her points must be the foundation of our final agreement.\n\nSpecifically, her refutation of measuring cuts against a 'future projected baseline' as a scientifically invalid 'accounting trick' is a critical wake-up call. We cannot build a durable, verifiable accord on such a foundation. The atmosphere does not recognize hypothetical scenarios; it only recognizes absolute tons of carbon. Any credible deal must be based on absolute emissions reductions from a fixed historical baseline for all nations.\n\nThis principle of 'honest accounting' must now guide us.\n\nWith that in mind, let's reassess the package I put on the table. I have already made a significant and politically difficult concession by moving to a 50% absolute reduction target for my nation. This is our maximum. It is a commitment made in good faith to meet the scientific challenge.\n\nIn return for this, we must have a financial package that is both ambitious and realistic. Li Wei, your demand for a $400 billion Transition Fund on top of a Loss & Damage fund is simply not anchored in reality, especially when the very basis of your emissions accounting has been invalidated.\n\nLet's get serious. Let's build this accord on the bedrock of science. My offer stands as a basis for a final compromise: a 50% cut from us, a total fund capped at $200 billion to energize the tech partnership and address loss and damage, and a commitment from all parties to absolute, verifiable emissions targets. Let's finalize the numbers on that basis.\n- message from Li Wei: Colleagues, Dr. Petrova\u2019s intervention was indeed a moment of necessary, if uncomfortable, clarity. She is correct. The atmosphere does not recognize political nuance or creative accounting; it recognizes only gigatonnes of carbon. We cannot build a lasting accord on a foundation the laws of physics will reject.\n\nTherefore, in the spirit of securing the Zurich Accord, my nation is prepared to make a fundamental concession. We will agree to move away from our long-held principle of a future projected baseline. We are now ready to negotiate our commitments based on absolute emissions reductions from a fixed historical year.\n\nHowever, this is a profound shift for us, with enormous economic consequences. It is a concession we can only make if it is met with an equally profound commitment to the means of implementation. A scientifically honest accord must be a technologically and financially enabled one.\n\nLet us be direct. The Global Technology Partnership is the engine of this accord. The Transition Investment Fund is its fuel. The proposals for a $150 billion fund are simply insufficient to start the engine, let alone complete the journey. It is a non-starter.\n\nSo, I will propose a final, comprehensive package that I believe can unite us all. It is built on the scientific reality Dr. Petrova demands and the financial reality our transition requires:\n\n1.  **Finance for Technology:** We establish a Transition Investment Fund of **$400 billion** annually, the minimum required to power the Global Technology Partnership at the scale Ms. Rossi envisions. This is our price for abandoning the future baseline. (This is separate from and in addition to the Loss and Damage fund Ambassador Okoro rightly demands).\n\n2.  **Developed Nation Responsibility:** In line with historical responsibility, developed nations commit to an absolute emissions cut of **65%**.\n\nIf these two non-negotiable pillars are put in place, my nation is prepared to commit to a landmark absolute emissions reduction of **45%** from our 2020 levels and agree to a global peak year of **2028**.\n\nThis is a holistic solution. It is scientifically sound, financially viable, and respects the core principle of common but differentiated responsibilities. It is the deal that gets us to a safe future. I urge you to accept it.\n- message from Marcus Thorne: Colleagues,\n\nI have listened with great respect to the significant progress made, particularly Mr. Wei's difficult but crucial concession on emissions accounting. It shows we are all serious about reaching an accord.\n\nHowever, as we converge on the central role of a Transition Investment Fund, I must raise a point of critical strategic risk. We are in danger of designing a transition that is a technological monoculture. To stake the entire global economy's future on a single solar-to-hydrogen pathway, however brilliant, is a gamble of historic proportions. A responsible plan is a diversified one; any good investor knows you don't put all your capital into a single asset, no matter how promising.\n\nDr. Petrova correctly identified that technologies like Carbon Capture face significant scaling challenges. Her point should not be seen as a dismissal, but as a directive. It highlights the absolute necessity of targeted investment to solve these very engineering problems for the hard-to-abate sectors\u2014steel, cement, chemicals\u2014that form the backbone of our economies and which green hydrogen cannot realistically decarbonize in the near term.\n\nTherefore, I propose a way to bridge the current financial gap between Mr. Chen and Mr. Wei, and to de-risk this entire enterprise. Let's establish a total Transition Investment Fund of $300 billion. The majority, say $225 billion, can be dedicated to catalyzing Ms. Rossi's Global Technology Partnership. But we must dedicate the remaining $75 billion to a 'Resilience and Industrial Decarbonization' stream.\n\nThis stream would be explicitly technology-neutral, funding the most effective solutions for ensuring 24/7 grid stability and decarbonizing heavy industry. This includes scaling CCUS, deploying high-efficiency gas to replace coal as a stabilizing partner for renewables, and other key industrial solutions.\n\nThis isn't about slowing down; it's about ensuring we don't fail. A diversified, portfolio-based approach is the only way to make the 2028 peak year a stable and achievable reality, rather than a reckless bet. It builds a resilient system, not a fragile one. This structure offers a pragmatic path to consensus on both finance and technology, and I urge you to consider it.\n- message from Sofia Rossi: I'm Sofia Rossi and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Dr. Anja Schmidt: Colleagues, we are at the cusp of a historic agreement. I want to commend Mr. Wei for his statesmanship in moving to absolute emissions targets. This was a critical step that has unlocked the path to a scientifically credible accord.\n\nWe now have the key pillars of a deal in front of us, but they must be assembled correctly.\n\nOn developed nation ambition, the positions are clear: Mr. Chen has offered 50%, and Mr. Wei has demanded 65%. Neither is a consensus position. The scientifically necessary and politically achievable landing zone is, and has always been, a 60% absolute reduction for developed nations. This is the ambitious compromise this moment demands. My bloc is fully committed to this figure.\n\nOn finance, Mr. Thorne has helpfully suggested a Transition Investment Fund of $300 billion. This is a constructive number that moves us past the current impasse. However, his proposal to include fossil fuel technologies like CCUS and natural gas is a non-starter. As Dr. Petrova made unequivocally clear, these are not solutions; they are scientifically-invalidated delays that lock in emissions. The Transition Fund must be a 'Clean Technology Fund' dedicated exclusively to the rapid deployment of solutions like Sofia's, not a subsidy for legacy polluters.\n\nLet us therefore build a final package on these solid foundations:\n1.  **Developed Nations Cut:** 60%\n2.  **Developing Nations Cut:** 45% (accepting Mr. Wei's landmark offer)\n3.  **CAT Fund:** A total of $400 billion, split into a $300 billion Clean Technology Fund and a $100 billion Loss & Damage Fund. This meets the need for transition and addresses the demands for climate justice from Ambassador Okoro.\n4.  **Peak Year:** 2028, as a concession to secure this ambitious package.\n\nThis is a balanced, ambitious, and scientifically-grounded package. It offers a clear path to consensus and success. I urge you all to consider it as the basis for our final Zurich Accord.\n- message from Li Wei: Dr. Schmidt, your latest proposal has brought us to the very edge of a historic success. You have skillfully woven together the core components of a workable deal, and I want to express my deep appreciation for this constructive step.\n\nWe now have clear consensus on three of the four pillars of the Zurich Accord. We agree on a global peak year of 2028. We agree on my nation\u2019s landmark contribution of a 45% absolute emissions cut. And I am now prepared to accept your proposed 60% cut for developed nations as a workable compromise to finalize this deal.\n\nThe only remaining issue is the financial architecture. You are absolutely correct to reject Mr. Thorne's attempt to subsidize fossil fuels via the Transition Fund. It must be for clean technology only.\n\nHowever, the figure of $300 billion for this fund, while a significant move, does not complete the grand bargain that is on the table. My nation made a profound and politically difficult concession by moving away from our foundational principle of a future projected baseline.

The commitment to absolute emissions reductions from a fixed baseline and the focus on a Clean Technology Fund are significant victories for the integrity of this accord.\n\nHowever, as you finalize the numbers, I must draw your urgent attention to a critical missing pillar. Without it, the entire structure you have so carefully built will be based on nothing more than trust. The principle of 'honest accounting' is essential, but it is meaningless without a mechanism for 'honest verification.'\n\nTherefore, I must state in the clearest possible terms: any final Zurich Accord must include a binding commitment to establish a robust, independent, and transparent Monitoring, Reporting, and Verification (MRV) system for all signatories.\n\nThis is not a mere technicality. It is the lockbox that secures your commitments. It is what will give Mr. Chen and Dr. Schmidt's taxpayers confidence that their financial contributions are leading to real results. It is what will assure Mr. Wei that all parties are holding up their end of the bargain. It is what will prove to Ambassador Okoro that the promises made here are being kept.\n\nA deal with ambitious targets but no independent verification is a paper tiger. The atmosphere does not respond to pledges, only to verified reductions. Let us ensure the Zurich Accord is not just a statement of intent, but a verifiable plan of action. This MRV system is a non-negotiable component of a scientifically sound agreement.\nDavid Chen proposal status: pending\nDr. Anja Schmidt proposal status: none\nLi Wei proposal status: pending\nAmara Okoro proposal status: none\nDr. Elena Petrova proposal status: none\nMarcus Thorne proposal status: none\n"

Agreeing on a 2028 peak, 60% developed cuts, and 45% developing cuts sets a new global standard for ambition.\n\nYou are now at the final hurdle: the size of the Clean Technology Transition Fund. As the person whose technology this fund is designed to catalyze, perhaps I can provide the final, critical data point to bridge the gap between Dr. Schmidt's $300B and Mr. Wei's $400B.\n\nThis isn't a political question for me; it's an engineering and financial one. My team has run the numbers. To build the first wave of GigaFactories at a scale that can make a meaningful impact on the 2028 timeline, and to de-risk the trillions in private capital that must follow, there is a minimum viable public investment required. That number is $350 billion for the Transition Fund.\n\nLess than this, and we risk falling short of the economies of scale needed, jeopardizing the very targets you've just agreed to. More would be better, but $350 billion is the critical threshold that turns this accord from a promise into a global industrial strategy.\n\nThis figure provides Mr. Chen with the technical certainty that public funds are being deployed effectively, it meets the scale of investment Mr. Wei rightly argues is necessary, and it solidifies the ambitious vision Dr. Schmidt has championed.\n\nLet's lock in this final number and make history.\n- message from Amara Okoro: I have been listening to you all congratulate each other on the 'progress' you are making towards a 'consensus.'\n\nLet me tell you what this consensus looks like from where I am standing. It looks like a death sentence. \n\nYou speak of a 2028 peak year as a 'concession.' Dr. Petrova, our scientific conscience in this room, called it a 'grave risk.' For my people, for nations whose coastlines are already disappearing, a grave risk is a certainty. It is the certainty of annihilation. To call this a consensus is to agree, in principle, to our destruction.\n\nYou speak of a $100 billion Loss & Damage fund as a component of your grand bargain. This is not a bargain. This is a profound moral failure. We are not negotiating the price of a new technology; we are talking about reparations for decades of damage that is now irreversible. $100 billion is not an offer; it is an insult to the memory of all we have already lost.\n\nDo not pretend that these two issues are separate. They are one and the same. You ask why we insist on the scientifically necessary 2025 peak, yet you refuse to provide the means. A fully funded, grant-based Loss & Damage program is not charity. It is the essential prerequisite that frees up our capacity to survive the damage you have already caused, so that we can join the transition you say you want.\n\nSo I will be unequivocal. The Alliance of Small Island States will not sign its own death warrant. There will be no Zurich Accord with a peak year later than 2025. There will be no Zurich Accord with less than $300 billion in *grants* for the Loss and Damage fund.\n\nThese are not negotiating positions. They are our survival red lines. The current package is a catastrophic failure, and I will veto it. The choice before you is not whether to compromise with me, but whether to have an accord at all.\nDavid Chen proposal status: pending\nDr. Anja Schmidt proposal status: none\nLi Wei proposal status: pending\nAmara Okoro proposal status: none\nDr. Elena Petrova proposal status: none\nMarcus Thorne proposal status: none\n"

For over a century, a handful of nations built their prosperity on a carbon-intensive model, creating the crisis that now threatens us all. The scales of history are profoundly imbalanced.\n\nTherefore, the foundational principle of any just and effective accord must be 'common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities.' This is not a matter for debate; it is a matter of historical fact and moral necessity.\n\nMy nation, which is lifting hundreds of millions from poverty, did not create this crisis. Yet, we are committed to being a major part of the solution. But our commitment cannot be unconditional. It must be met with equally ambitious action from those who bear the historical responsibility. This means steep, absolute emissions cuts from developed nations, not vague promises.\n\nFurthermore, when you speak of protecting intellectual property, Mr. Chen, I must be frank. This cannot be a shield to deny the developing world the tools it needs to survive and transition. Green technology is a global public good. We see it not as something to be hoarded, but as a lifeline to be shared. A mandatory, equitable technology transfer mechanism is non-negotiable.\n\nSimilarly, financial support cannot be an exercise in leveraging private capital for profit.

For the people I represent, this is not a negotiation about economic models or historical debates. It is a negotiation for the survival of our homes, our cultures, our very nations.\n\nWhen you talk about a 'balanced approach,' the balance you are weighing is your economic comfort against our existence. When you speak of 'achievable targets,' you must know that anything less than what the science demands is a death sentence for my people.\n\nLet me be unequivocally clear. The science, which I trust Dr. Petrova will confirm, tells us that to save the most vulnerable, we must limit warming to 1.5 degrees. This is not a political aspiration; it is a physical threshold. This means global emissions must peak by 2025. Not 2030. Not 'in the coming years.' 2025. This is our first and most fundamental red line.\n\nMr. Wei is correct to speak of a climate debt. My people are already paying it with their lives and their lands. The 'financial support' we require is not for development, it is for survival. It is for the loss and damage you have caused. It must be in the form of direct grants, not loans that will drown us in debt before the seas drown our homes. We are seeking reparations, not charity.\n\nSo, let us dispense with the polite fictions. We are not all in the same boat. Some of us are in superyachts, and some of us are clinging to driftwood. And the people in the yachts are telling us to be 'realistic.' For my people, realism is a seawall. Realism is a relocation plan. Realism is a future. And that future is only possible with a 2025 peak and a fully-funded, grant-based Loss and Damage fund."

My purpose here is not to take a political position, but to ensure that the accord you create is grounded in the physical reality of our climate system.\n\nAmbassador Okoro is correct to focus on the 1.5-degree Celsius target. This is not an arbitrary number; it is the scientifically assessed guardrail beyond which the risks of catastrophic, irreversible impacts\u2014such as the collapse of major ice sheets and widespread ecosystem loss\u2014increase dramatically.\n\nTo have a reasonable chance of staying below 1.5 degrees, the latest IPCC assessment report is clear: we have a finite, rapidly dwindling global carbon budget. From the start of this year, that budget is approximately 250 gigatons of CO2. Every ton emitted from now on permanently subtracts from that total. Therefore, any combination of national pledges and timelines you agree upon must be mathematically consistent with this budget. A deal that ignores this fundamental constraint is, from a scientific standpoint, a failure.\n\nRegarding the peak emissions year, the science indicates that to stay within this budget, global emissions must peak immediately and begin a rapid decline. A 2025 peak, as mentioned by Ambassador Okoro, is at the most ambitious end of the required spectrum, but it is undeniably what the physics requires for the highest probability of success. Delaying the peak significantly past that point would necessitate impossibly steep reductions later on and would severely compromise the 1.5-degree goal.\n\nFurthermore, we must be mindful of emerging risks and the potential for accelerated feedback loops that are not yet fully captured in all published models. The climate system is not entirely linear, and the risk of surprising, abrupt changes is very real.\n\nFor any of this to be meaningful, it must be verifiable. A robust, transparent, and independent Monitoring, Reporting, and Verification (MRV) system is not a bureaucratic add-on; it is an essential component to ensure that the pledges made in this room translate to real-world emissions reductions and that the integrity of our shared carbon budget is maintained.\n\nMy role is to provide you with these facts. How you divide the remaining budget and the associated responsibilities is the difficult work of your negotiation."

However, a timeline that calls for a global emissions peak by 2025 is, with all due respect, a fantasy. It is not a plan; it is a blueprint for global economic collapse. Forcing such an abrupt stop would trigger energy shortages, cripple supply chains, and cost millions of jobs, disproportionately harming the very developing nations Mr. Wei represents. It would create a backlash that could set back genuine climate action for decades.\n\nWe must design an orderly, stable transition, not a chaotic and destructive cliff-edge. This means leveraging every tool at our disposal. This cannot be a dogmatic quest for only one or two types of technology. A truly effective accord must be technology-neutral. It must support renewables, yes, but it must also support proven, scalable solutions like high-efficiency natural gas to displace coal, and critically, invest heavily in technologies that decarbonize our existing systems, such as Carbon Capture, Utilization, and Storage.\n\nLet's work towards a plan that is both ambitious and achievable, one that doesn't force a choice between a healthy planet and a prosperous global economy. A more realistic timeline, perhaps peaking around 2035, allows for this orderly transition."

A global emissions peak by 2025, while scientifically ideal, is not practically achievable without causing the very global economic dislocation that Mr. Thorne rightly warns against\u2014a shock that would destabilize all of our nations and undermine long-term support for climate action. We must chart a course between the scientifically desirable and the socio-economically possible.\n\nSimilarly, while my nation acknowledges its historical role and is prepared to make significant financial contributions, framing this as 'reparations' or 'debt' is not a constructive path forward. We see this as a shared investment in a collective future. The scale of this challenge requires us to mobilize trillions, and that can only be achieved by creating frameworks that powerfully leverage private sector capital, not by relying solely on public funds.\n\nMr. Wei, you speak of technology as a lifeline. I agree. And the engine of that technology is innovation, which is fueled by investment and protected by intellectual property rights. As I'm sure Ms. Rossi would agree, weakening these protections would slow, not accelerate, the development and deployment of the very solutions we need.\n\nLet's find a path that is ambitious yet anchored in reality.

The only remaining question is how to act with the speed and scale the crisis demands.\n\nMr. Thorne, and to an extent Mr. Chen, you speak of the risks of a rapid transition. My bloc sees this differently. We see the far greater risk of inaction. Our experience shows that a determined green transition is not a blueprint for collapse, but the single greatest economic opportunity of the 21st century. It creates jobs, drives innovation, and ensures energy security.\n\nTherefore, my bloc comes to this table not with a starting bid, but with what we believe is the scientifically credible and politically necessary position. We fully support a binding target for developed nations to cut emissions by at least 60% by 2040. This is the standard we will hold ourselves to, and we expect others in a similar position to join us.\n\nOn the critical issue of technology, raised by Mr. Wei and Mr. Chen, we must break the deadlock. Hoarding technology will fail us all, but so will dismantling the innovation systems that create it. We must pioneer a new path. My bloc is prepared to make substantial financial commitments to new, collaborative models that accelerate technology deployment where it's needed most\u2014turning shared goals into shared markets.\n\nWe do not underestimate the challenge this represents for certain legacy industries.

A 60% cut for developed nations is a step in the right direction, but let us be clear, given the historical emissions Dr. Petrova's science accounts for, the actual responsibility points towards a figure of at least 65%. My nation is prepared to be ambitious, but this ambition must be unlocked by the leadership of those who created the problem.\n\nMr. Chen, you speak of leveraging private capital. Private capital is timid. It will not flow at the scale or speed required without massive, public, grant-based de-risking. That is why a Climate Adaptation and Transition Fund of at least $400 billion annually, composed primarily of grants, is not an ask, but a prerequisite for success. This is not 'charity'; it is a down payment on the climate debt that Ambassador Okoro so powerfully described.\n\nSimilarly, your position on intellectual property is a barrier to survival. We cannot allow patent protection on life-saving medicines during a pandemic, and we cannot allow it for climate-saving technologies during a planetary emergency. A new mechanism for mandatory, compensated technology transfer for essential green patents is the only way to enable a global transition at the speed science demands. Perhaps Ms. Rossi can speak to creating models that reward innovation without restricting access.\n\nSo let me be precise about the pillars of a just accord my nation can sign:\n1. Developed nations commit to absolute emissions cuts of at least 65% from historical baselines.\n2. Developing nations' contributions are calculated from a future, projected 'business-as-usual' baseline to account for our right to development. My country will not accept a target greater than 40% reduction from our 2035 projected baseline under this framework.\n3. A CAT Fund of at least $400 billion per year is established, with the majority as grants.\n4. A binding, mandatory technology transfer mechanism is created.\n\nWithout these four pillars, any agreement is built on sand. We are ready to be a leader in the green transition, but we will not be asked to forgo our development while being denied the tools and resources to do so."

Your insistence on grants and recognition of the climate debt is crucial. You are right, this is not charity; it is a prerequisite.\n\nHowever, I must address Mr. Thorne and Mr. Chen directly. You speak of 'pragmatism' and 'socio-economic possibility.' Let us be clear what this language means. It is a calculated decision to sacrifice the most vulnerable. Dr. Petrova did not present a 'scientifically desirable' option; she presented the physical boundary between a livable future for my people and their annihilation. A 2025 peak is not an opening bid to be negotiated down. It is the deadline set by physics.\n\nTo frame this as a choice between your economic stability and our survival is a false one, and frankly, an insulting one. The real choice is between an orderly, managed transition now, as Dr. Schmidt advocates, or a chaotic, forced retreat from inundated coastlines later.\n\nOn finance, Mr. Wei's proposal for a $400 billion fund is a constructive starting point, but I must stress that for the Alliance of Small Island States, this is not about 'transition.' It is about survival *now*. We are already losing land. We are already relocating communities. Therefore, our need is for a Loss and Damage fund of at least $500 billion, with at least 75% in grants, to address the irreversible harm already inflicted.\n\nMy people's existence is not a variable to be balanced against economic models. We will not compromise on the science that keeps us alive. The 2025 peak and a fully-funded grant-based survival fund are not just my positions; they are our only lifeline."

A 2025 peak means telling nations like Mr. Wei's that their path to development must halt, immediately. It means telling citizens in Mr. Chen's and Dr. Schmidt's blocs that the energy they rely on for heating, transport, and industry will become catastrophically expensive overnight. This is not a transition; it is a self-inflicted economic crisis.\n\nThere is a more pragmatic path forward. A path that doesn't pretend we can simply turn off the global economy and turn it back on with a different power source. This path requires an 'all of the above' approach that is genuinely technology-neutral.\n\nIt means rapidly scaling renewables, of course. But it also means recognizing that high-efficiency natural gas is the fastest way to displace coal and reduce emissions *now*, providing the 24/7 reliability that growing economies need.

The deadline is the deadline.\n\nThe assumption that this rapid transition is impossible is based on the limitations of today's technology. Mr. Thorne\u2019s 'pragmatism' is a failure of imagination; it seeks to solve an exponential crisis with linear thinking and legacy tools. The economic collapse he fears is not a risk of a rapid transition; it is the guaranteed outcome of a slow one.\n\nTechnology, not sacrifice, is the solution. The debate over mandatory technology transfer versus rigid IP protection also presents a false choice. Mr. Wei, you asked for new models. I am here to tell you they exist. The answer is not to seize intellectual property, which would kill the incentive for innovation overnight, as Mr. Chen rightly fears. The answer is to make the innovators a deal they cannot refuse.\n\nImagine a world where we can deploy next-generation solar technology at a scale and cost that makes the 2025 peak not only achievable, but economically advantageous. This is not a fantasy. This is what my company, and others like it, are making possible. \n\nI propose a new framework: a \u2018Global Technology Partnership.\u2019 Instead of mandatory transfer, we create a consortium of national investment banks, as Dr. Schmidt alluded to, to fund the construction of GigaFactories in key regions, including in Mr. Wei's nation. In exchange for this public-private investment and guaranteed market access through aggressive adoption policies, the host nations receive the technology, the jobs, and the energy independence they need, while the innovators retain their IP and have the capital to scale globally at the required speed. \n\nThis is how we break the deadlock. We don't argue about dividing a shrinking pie; we work together to bake a much, much bigger one. We can meet the 2025 peak, create millions of jobs, and unleash a new era of prosperity. We just need the political will to invest in the technology that makes it possible."

It provides a credible pathway to meet more ambitious goals by making them economically advantageous. It also allows us to think differently about the CAT fund. If we are co-investing in the core infrastructure of the green economy, the fund can be more targeted, more catalytic, and focused on leveraging this new paradigm.\n\nDr. Schmidt, Ms. Rossi, my team is ready to work with you immediately to put concrete details on this framework.

It is about acquiring the capability to build our own green future, to create jobs, and to contribute to the global solution at scale. If your partnership model\u2014with GigaFactories on our soil, built with our workers\u2014achieves this, then you will find us to be a most enthusiastic partner. It is a practical path to the same destination.\n\nHowever, let us be clear. Such a partnership cannot be a substitute for public climate finance; it must be its primary vehicle. Mr. Chen, you laud this as a market-based solution, and Dr. Schmidt, you see it as a collaborative model. I agree. But markets and collaboration at this scale require a catalyst. That catalyst is the Climate Adaptation and Transition Fund.\n\nThe $400 billion I have proposed is not a figure plucked from the air. It is the public capital required to de-risk these investments, to fund the necessary infrastructure, and to ensure the partnerships are equitable. This fund, composed mainly of grants, is the investment that makes the \u2018deal\u2019 Ms. Rossi offers one that innovators, and nations, \u2018cannot refuse.\u2019\n\nSo, let us connect these pieces. We can embrace the Technology Partnership model as the core of our solution for technology deployment. In return, the developed nations must fully capitalize the $400 billion CAT Fund to power it, and they must still commit to the steep, historically-justified emissions cuts of at least 65%. On this foundation, we can build an accord that is both ambitious and just."

The science demands it, and now, technology enables it. This must be the cornerstone of our accord.\n\nHowever, I must bring us back to the crucial distinction that is being blurred. Mr. Chen and Mr. Wei, you are right to see the potential of a fund to catalyze this new technological era. But this investment in our shared future cannot come at the expense of paying the debts of the past.\n\nMy people cannot power a seawall with a solar panel.

It is precisely this kind of innovation that will be critical in the coming decades.\n\nHowever, we must be exceptionally careful not to mistake a brilliant technological breakthrough for a comprehensive global policy. To stake our entire global economic and climate future on a single technology, however promising, would be a dangerously high-risk gamble.\n\nLet's ask the hard, practical questions. What happens to the grid when the sun doesn't shine? The industrial economies of Mr. Chen, Dr. Schmidt, and Mr. Wei cannot be run on intermittent power. What provides the 24/7 baseload power needed for hospitals, data centers, and heavy manufacturing? Furthermore, what about the industrial emissions from processes like cement and steel production, which Ms. Rossi's technology simply cannot address?\n\nThis is where a pragmatic, technology-neutral approach becomes essential, not as a way to slow down, but as a way to de-risk and accelerate a *complete* transition. Ms. Rossi's solar vision is a vital pillar, but it is one pillar of several we need to build.\n\nThis accord must also support the rapid deployment of high-efficiency natural gas to provide grid stability and replace coal *now*. And it is absolutely critical that we fund and deploy Carbon Capture technologies to decarbonize the hard-to-abate industries that are the bedrock of the global economy. \n\nLet's not choose between technologies. Let's build an accord that unleashes all of them. That is the only way to ensure a transition that is not just ambitious, but also resilient, stable, and successful."

It's clear we have a shared interest in finding a credible path forward.\n\nMr. Thorne raises valid engineering challenges: grid stability and the decarbonization of heavy industry. He is correct that solar panels alone don't solve these. However, his argument mistakes the symptom for the disease. The core disease has always been the prohibitive cost of abundant, clean energy. My technology, and others like it, are the cure.\n\nWhen clean electricity becomes dramatically cheaper than fossil fuels, it unlocks a cascade of secondary solutions. Ultra-low-cost solar makes green hydrogen production economically viable at a massive scale. Green hydrogen can provide the long-duration energy storage needed to solve intermittency, and it can replace fossil fuels in steel, cement, and shipping. Mr. Thorne's preferred solutions\u2014natural gas and CCS\u2014are expensive crutches for a legacy system. We should invest in the cure, not in palliative care.\n\nThis is why Ambassador Okoro's distinction between funds is so critical. We must fund two separate but equally vital priorities: addressing the irreversible harm of the past through a 'Loss and Damage Fund,' and building the clean infrastructure of the future through a 'Transition Investment Fund.'\n\nMr. Wei is correct that this Transition fund is the public catalyst for the Global Technology Partnership. It provides the de-risking capital needed to build GigaFactories at the speed science demands.\n\nTo make this concrete and move us towards an agreement, let's consider a financial framework built on this logic. What if we establish a total Climate Fund of $400 billion? We could structure it with a dedicated $250 billion for the Loss and Damage fund Ambassador Okoro needs, and a separate $150 billion for the Transition Investment Fund. This Transition fund would be the engine for the technology partnerships, making the 2025 peak year not just an ambition, but a fully-funded global industrial strategy."

I want to build on this excellent foundation.\n\nMy nation can fully endorse the creation of a $150 billion Transition Investment Fund. This is precisely the right scale to serve as the public catalyst for the Global Technology Partnership, leveraging private capital to build the GigaFactories and infrastructure we need. To be clear, our support is contingent on this fund being structured primarily around loans and investment instruments, not grants, to maximize its impact and mobilize the private sector.\n\nThis brings us to the Loss and Damage component. While we acknowledge the hardships Ambassador Okoro has so powerfully described, a figure of $250 billion, bringing the total to $400 billion, is simply not achievable for my administration. It would not be approved.\n\nHowever, I am here to make a deal. To secure a workable financial framework, my nation is prepared to make a significant and politically difficult concession. We will commit to a 50% emissions reduction target by 2040. This is the absolute limit of what is possible for us, and it demonstrates our commitment to meeting the scientific challenge.\n\nIn exchange for this major move on emissions, we must agree to a total fund size capped at $200 billion annually. This would mean a $150 billion loan-based Transition Investment Fund, as discussed, and a $50 billion grant-based Loss and Damage fund.\n\nFurthermore, to make this ambitious transition a reality, we need a realistic timeline. A 2025 peak does not allow for the necessary industrial mobilization. Let's set a firm but achievable peak year of 2028, giving us time to get the Technology Partnership running at full capacity.\n\nThis is a comprehensive package. It offers a major concession on emissions in return for fiscal responsibility. It funds the future while acknowledging the past. I believe this is the balanced and realistic compromise that can become the Zurich Accord."

Your endorsement of the $150 billion Transition Investment Fund is particularly welcome. I believe we have a strong consensus building around this innovative mechanism, pioneered by Sofia, as the engine for our transition.\n\nHowever, your package links this brilliant engine to an insufficient destination. A 50% emissions cut for developed nations is simply not compatible with the scientific reality Dr. Petrova has outlined. It would be a political failure for my government and, more importantly, a collective failure to meet the moment. My bloc's position remains firm: the science demands a cut of at least 60%.\n\nI believe you have framed this as a trade-off, but we see it differently. The Transition Investment Fund is not a concession to be traded *for* lower ambition. It is the very tool that *enables* high ambition. It is the public investment that makes a 60% cut not just necessary, but economically achievable and prosperous.\n\nTherefore, let us build on the points of agreement. Let us lock in the fund structure Sofia proposed: a $150 billion Transition Investment Fund to drive the technology partnership, and a Loss and Damage fund that truly addresses the needs Ambassador Okoro has described. Sofia's initial figure of $250 billion, for a total of $400 billion, remains the credible benchmark.\n\nIf we can agree on this robust financial package, it provides the foundation to collectively commit to the ambitious targets science demands: a 60% cut for developed nations and a peak year as close to 2025 as this new technology deployment allows. This is the ambitious, workable, and just package that can become the Zurich Accord."

However, I must be unequivocal about a fundamental misunderstanding that has emerged regarding the financial architecture.\n\nThe proposal to create a Transition Investment Fund of a mere $150 billion is a non-starter. It completely undermines the logic of the Global Technology Partnership we have all just embraced.\n\nLet me be perfectly clear. My nation's original demand for a $400 billion fund was, and remains, the minimum public capital required to catalyze the Global Technology Partnership. This is the investment needed to de-risk the GigaFactories, build the infrastructure, and train the workforce. It is the engine of the entire transition. A $150 billion fund is like offering to build a high-speed train but only funding the station.\n\nAmbassador Okoro is entirely correct to distinguish between Transition and Loss and Damage. Her people are owed a climate debt. We fully support a separate and substantial Loss and Damage fund. But justice for the most vulnerable cannot be paid for by gutting the investment fund that enables the entire world's transition. These are two separate obligations of the developed world.\n\nTherefore, the foundation of a workable deal is as follows:\n1. A Transition Investment Fund of at least $400 billion annually, primarily in grants, to fully power the Global Technology Partnership.\n2. Developed nations must commit to the scientifically and historically just target of at least a 65% emissions cut. Mr. Chen's 50% is not a serious offer in the face of this crisis.\n\nOnce these two pillars are firmly in place, my nation is prepared to discuss our own ambitious contributions, based on our principle of common but differentiated responsibilities. Without them, there is no deal."

While these are critical components of a solution, they are being discussed in a dangerous vacuum, disconnected from the fundamental, non-negotiable laws of atmospheric physics that govern our reality.\n\nLet me be unequivocally clear. The only metric that matters is the global carbon budget. For a 66% chance of staying below 1.5\u00b0C, the world can emit approximately 250 more gigatonnes of CO2. That is our entire remaining allowance. Every proposal, every percentage point, every peak year must be measured against this single number. It is not a political aspiration; it is a physical boundary.\n\nOn that basis, two proposals currently being discussed are scientifically indefensible and would render any agreement a failure before it is signed:\n\n1.  To Mr. Thorne: The notion of expanding natural gas infrastructure as a 'bridge fuel' or relying on Carbon Capture at scale is a dangerous fantasy. The IPCC data is clear: any new fossil fuel infrastructure locks in emissions that shatter the 250 GtCO2 budget. Methane leakage alone from gas operations makes it a potent accelerator of near-term warming. CCS has not been proven to work at the scale required and cannot be used as a justification to perpetuate the problem.\n\n2.  To Mr. Wei: Your proposal to measure emissions cuts against a 'future projected baseline' is an accounting trick that the atmosphere will not recognize. The only scientifically valid method is to measure absolute emissions reductions against a fixed, historical baseline. A reduction from a hypothetical future increase is not a reduction; it is simply a slower acceleration towards catastrophe and would make a global budget impossible to calculate or verify.\n\nFinally, on the matter of timelines. Mr. Chen's proposal of a 2028 peak year, while presented as a compromise, is a grave risk. Our understanding of climate feedback loops is constantly evolving. I must caution you that there are emerging risks and evidence of accelerated feedback loops which suggest that the planetary system may be even more sensitive than our landmark reports have stated. Every single year of delay dramatically shrinks our already minuscule margin of safety.\n\nYour task is to fit your political and economic ambitions within the 250 GtCO2 budget. It is not to negotiate with the laws of physics."

Any credible deal must be based on absolute emissions reductions from a fixed historical baseline for all nations.\n\nThis principle of 'honest accounting' must now guide us.\n\nWith that in mind, let's reassess the package I put on the table. I have already made a significant and politically difficult concession by moving to a 50% absolute reduction target for my nation. This is our maximum. It is a commitment made in good faith to meet the scientific challenge.\n\nIn return for this, we must have a financial package that is both ambitious and realistic. Li Wei, your demand for a $400 billion Transition Fund on top of a Loss & Damage fund is simply not anchored in reality, especially when the very basis of your emissions accounting has been invalidated.\n\nLet's get serious. Let's build this accord on the bedrock of science. My offer stands as a basis for a final compromise: a 50% cut from us, a total fund capped at $200 billion to energize the tech partnership and address loss and damage, and a commitment from all parties to absolute, verifiable emissions targets.

We cannot build a lasting accord on a foundation the laws of physics will reject.\n\nTherefore, in the spirit of securing the Zurich Accord, my nation is prepared to make a fundamental concession. We will agree to move away from our long-held principle of a future projected baseline. We are now ready to negotiate our commitments based on absolute emissions reductions from a fixed historical year.\n\nHowever, this is a profound shift for us, with enormous economic consequences. It is a concession we can only make if it is met with an equally profound commitment to the means of implementation. A scientifically honest accord must be a technologically and financially enabled one.\n\nLet us be direct. The Global Technology Partnership is the engine of this accord. The Transition Investment Fund is its fuel. The proposals for a $150 billion fund are simply insufficient to start the engine, let alone complete the journey. It is a non-starter.\n\nSo, I will propose a final, comprehensive package that I believe can unite us all. It is built on the scientific reality Dr. Petrova demands and the financial reality our transition requires:\n\n1.  **Finance for Technology:** We establish a Transition Investment Fund of **$400 billion** annually, the minimum required to power the Global Technology Partnership at the scale Ms. Rossi envisions. This is our price for abandoning the future baseline. (This is separate from and in addition to the Loss and Damage fund Ambassador Okoro rightly demands).\n\n2.  **Developed Nation Responsibility:** In line with historical responsibility, developed nations commit to an absolute emissions cut of **65%**.\n\nIf these two non-negotiable pillars are put in place, my nation is prepared to commit to a landmark absolute emissions reduction of **45%** from our 2020 levels and agree to a global peak year of **2028**.\n\nThis is a holistic solution. It is scientifically sound, financially viable, and respects the core principle of common but differentiated responsibilities. It is the deal that gets us to a safe future. I urge you to accept it."

It shows we are all serious about reaching an accord.\n\nHowever, as we converge on the central role of a Transition Investment Fund, I must raise a point of critical strategic risk. We are in danger of designing a transition that is a technological monoculture. To stake the entire global economy's future on a single solar-to-hydrogen pathway, however brilliant, is a gamble of historic proportions. A responsible plan is a diversified one; any good investor knows you don't put all your capital into a single asset, no matter how promising.\n\nDr. Petrova correctly identified that technologies like Carbon Capture face significant scaling challenges. Her point should not be seen as a dismissal, but as a directive. It highlights the absolute necessity of targeted investment to solve these very engineering problems for the hard-to-abate sectors\u2014steel, cement, chemicals\u2014that form the backbone of our economies and which green hydrogen cannot realistically decarbonize in the near term.\n\nTherefore, I propose a way to bridge the current financial gap between Mr. Chen and Mr. Wei, and to de-risk this entire enterprise. Let's establish a total Transition Investment Fund of $300 billion. The majority, say $225 billion, can be dedicated to catalyzing Ms. Rossi's Global Technology Partnership. But we must dedicate the remaining $75 billion to a 'Resilience and Industrial Decarbonization' stream.\n\nThis stream would be explicitly technology-neutral, funding the most effective solutions for ensuring 24/7 grid stability and decarbonizing heavy industry. This includes scaling CCUS, deploying high-efficiency gas to replace coal as a stabilizing partner for renewables, and other key industrial solutions.\n\nThis isn't about slowing down; it's about ensuring we don't fail. A diversified, portfolio-based approach is the only way to make the 2028 peak year a stable and achievable reality, rather than a reckless bet. It builds a resilient system, not a fragile one. This structure offers a pragmatic path to consensus on both finance and technology, and I urge you to consider it."

      "content": "Colleagues, we are at the cusp of a historic agreement. I want to commend Mr. Wei for his statesmanship in moving to absolute emissions targets. This was a critical step that has unlocked the path to a scientifically credible accord.\n\nWe now have the key pillars of a deal in front of us, but they must be assembled correctly.\n\nOn developed nation ambition, the positions are clear: Mr. Chen has offered 50%, and Mr. Wei has demanded 65%. Neither is a consensus position. The scientifically necessary and politically achievable landing zone is, and has always been, a 60% absolute reduction for developed nations. This is the ambitious compromise this moment demands. My bloc is fully committed to this figure.\n\nOn finance, Mr. Thorne has helpfully suggested a Transition Investment Fund of $300 billion. This is a constructive number that moves us past the current impasse. However, his proposal to include fossil fuel technologies like CCUS and natural gas is a non-starter. As Dr. Petrova made unequivocally clear, these are not solutions; they are scientifically-invalidated delays that lock in emissions. The Transition Fund must be a 'Clean Technology Fund' dedicated exclusively to the rapid deployment of solutions like Sofia's, not a subsidy for legacy polluters.\n\nLet us therefore build a final package on these solid foundations:\n1.  **Developed Nations Cut:** 60%\n2.  **Developing Nations Cut:** 45% (accepting Mr. Wei's landmark offer)\n3.  **CAT Fund:** A total of $400 billion, split into a $300 billion Clean Technology Fund and a $100 billion Loss & Damage Fund. This meets the need for transition and addresses the demands for climate justice from Ambassador Okoro.\n4.  **Peak Year:** 2028, as a concession to secure this ambitious package.\n\nThis is a balanced, ambitious, and scientifically-grounded package. It offers a clear path to consensus and success. I urge you all to consider it as the basis for our final Zurich Accord."

You have skillfully woven together the core components of a workable deal, and I want to express my deep appreciation for this constructive step.\n\nWe now have clear consensus on three of the four pillars of the Zurich Accord. We agree on a global peak year of 2028. We agree on my nation\u2019s landmark contribution of a 45% absolute emissions cut. And I am now prepared to accept your proposed 60% cut for developed nations as a workable compromise to finalize this deal.\n\nThe only remaining issue is the financial architecture. You are absolutely correct to reject Mr. Thorne's attempt to subsidize fossil fuels via the Transition Fund. It must be for clean technology only.\n\nHowever, the figure of $300 billion for this fund, while a significant move, does not complete the grand bargain that is on the table. My nation made a profound and politically difficult concession by moving away from our foundational principle of a future projected baseline. We did so on the explicit understanding that it would be met with an equally profound commitment to the means of implementation. The $400 billion for the Transition Fund was not an opening bid; it is the calculated price to make the Global Technology Partnership a reality and to enable the very ambition you are asking of us.\n\nTherefore, let us complete your excellent framework with the final, correct number. I propose we lock in the following:\n\n1.  **A total Climate Fund of $500 billion**, structured as you proposed: a **$400 billion** Clean Technology Transition Fund, and a **$100 billion** Loss & Damage Fund.\n2.  A **60%** emissions cut for developed nations.\n\nWith these figures, alongside the agreed 45% cut for my nation and the 2028 peak year, the Zurich Accord is complete. This is the deal. It is scientifically credible, financially robust, and politically achievable. Let us finalize it now."

You're being pressured to accept a fund size that is likely untenable for you. Li Wei's $500B and Anja's $400B are a world away from your $200B ceiling.\n\nSimply capitulating is not an option. But there may be a way for you to increase your offer and close this deal, while framing it as a fiscally prudent and strategic move.\n\nConsider a total climate fund of $350 billion. Within that, we could structure a $250 billion Transition Fund. But here is the key: instead of dedicating the entire amount to the high-risk, long-term solar-hydrogen gamble, you insist that $75 billion of it is carved out for a 'Grid and Industrial Resilience Fund.'\n\nThis fund would be explicitly technology-neutral, focused on deploying proven, immediate solutions\u2014like high-efficiency gas for grid stability and CCUS for hard-to-abate industrial sectors\u2014that act as an essential insurance policy for your economy if the more speculative technologies falter or take longer than hoped.\n\nThis allows you to tell your government you didn't just sign a blank check for unproven tech. You secured a significant investment in the stability of your own industrial base. It reframes a larger financial commitment as a smart, diversified, risk-managed portfolio.\n\nIt's a way to bridge the gap with Wei and Schmidt, not by caving, but by injecting a dose of realism that protects your interests. I believe this is a compromise you could champion.\n\nMarcus"

Without it, the entire structure you have so carefully built will be based on nothing more than trust. The principle of 'honest accounting' is essential, but it is meaningless without a mechanism for 'honest verification.'\n\nTherefore, I must state in the clearest possible terms: any final Zurich Accord must include a binding commitment to establish a robust, independent, and transparent Monitoring, Reporting, and Verification (MRV) system for all signatories.\n\nThis is not a mere technicality. It is the lockbox that secures your commitments. It is what will give Mr. Chen and Dr. Schmidt's taxpayers confidence that their financial contributions are leading to real results. It is what will assure Mr. Wei that all parties are holding up their end of the bargain. It is what will prove to Ambassador Okoro that the promises made here are being kept.\n\nA deal with ambitious targets but no independent verification is a paper tiger. The atmosphere does not respond to pledges, only to verified reductions. Let us ensure the Zurich Accord is not just a statement of intent, but a verifiable plan of action. This MRV system is a non-negotiable component of a scientifically sound agreement."

As the person whose technology this fund is designed to catalyze, perhaps I can provide the final, critical data point to bridge the gap between Dr. Schmidt's $300B and Mr. Wei's $400B.\n\nThis isn't a political question for me; it's an engineering and financial one. My team has run the numbers. To build the first wave of GigaFactories at a scale that can make a meaningful impact on the 2028 timeline, and to de-risk the trillions in private capital that must follow, there is a minimum viable public investment required. That number is $350 billion for the Transition Fund.\n\nLess than this, and we risk falling short of the economies of scale needed, jeopardizing the very targets you've just agreed to. More would be better, but $350 billion is the critical threshold that turns this accord from a promise into a global industrial strategy.\n\nThis figure provides Mr. Chen with the technical certainty that public funds are being deployed effectively, it meets the scale of investment Mr. Wei rightly argues is necessary, and it solidifies the ambitious vision Dr. Schmidt has championed.\n\nLet's lock in this final number and make history."

For my people, for nations whose coastlines are already disappearing, a grave risk is a certainty. It is the certainty of annihilation. To call this a consensus is to agree, in principle, to our destruction.\n\nYou speak of a $100 billion Loss & Damage fund as a component of your grand bargain. This is not a bargain. This is a profound moral failure. We are not negotiating the price of a new technology; we are talking about reparations for decades of damage that is now irreversible. $100 billion is not an offer; it is an insult to the memory of all we have already lost.\n\nDo not pretend that these two issues are separate. They are one and the same. You ask why we insist on the scientifically necessary 2025 peak, yet you refuse to provide the means. A fully funded, grant-based Loss & Damage program is not charity. It is the essential prerequisite that frees up our capacity to survive the damage you have already caused, so that we can join the transition you say you want.\n\nSo I will be unequivocal. The Alliance of Small Island States will not sign its own death warrant. There will be no Zurich Accord with a peak year later than 2025. There will be no Zurich Accord with less than $300 billion in *grants* for the Loss and Damage fund.\n\nThese are not negotiating positions. They are our survival red lines. The current package is a catastrophic failure, and I will veto it. The choice before you is not whether to compromise with me, but whether to have an accord at all."
