A potential solution involves Major Reed conceding to a 10 MHz guard band in exchange for strict power controls (which Chloe's secret tech can help mitigate), allowing the FCC to auction 90 MHz. Ben could create a new entrant set-aside for 20 MHz, which Liam wins for ~$4B. Chloe wins the remaining 70 MHz for ~$22B.

This is a major victory, removing a key AetherLink demand and reinforcing my position on fiscal responsibility. However, Carter has immediately pivoted to a new, significant threat: he has explicitly stated a 'clear desire for a multi-winner outcome' and directly asked me how OmniWave can satisfy this while getting the spectrum we need. This is a direct challenge to my primary goal of securing the entire 80 MHz block. My strategy must now shift from merely defeating the set-aside to proactively redefining the 'public interest.' I will argue that the true public interest isn't the number of license holders, but the speed and scale of a nationwide 5G deployment, especially to rural areas. I will frame a single, contiguous 80 MHz block for OmniWave as the *only* way to achieve this national strategic goal, and I will propose attaching aggressive build-out commitments that only a company of our scale can realistically meet. This reframes the debate from 'competition' to 'national achievement' and gives Carter a public interest justification for awarding the entire block to us."

For OmniWave, and frankly for the nation's 5G leadership, this 100 MHz block is not just another asset; it's the linchpin of our entire next-generation strategy. Our '5G Everywhere' initiative is dependent on securing a large, contiguous block of this mid-band spectrum to deliver the gigabit speeds and capacity that American consumers and industries are demanding.\n\nTo that end, our primary and non-negotiable goal in this negotiation is to secure a license for at least 80 MHz of this spectrum.

We are fully prepared to be good stewards of this spectrum and to work collaboratively on a technical solution that ensures your operations are protected. However, it must be a solution that doesn't undermine the commercial viability of the band with excessive guard bands or debilitating power restrictions.\n\nCommissioner Carter, we believe the best way to serve the public interest is to put this spectrum to its highest and best use as quickly as possible, and we are prepared to pay a fair market price to do so. A decisive allocation to a national carrier like OmniWave is the fastest path to realizing that public benefit.\n\nI look forward to a productive conversation and finding a path forward that works for all of us.\n- message from Ben Carter: Good morning, everyone. I'm Ben Carter from the FCC. Welcome, and thank you for being here. Our task is to collaboratively design a successful allocation plan for this crucial 100 MHz block of mid-band spectrum. The Commission's mandate is to serve the public interest, and for this process, we see that resting on three key pillars. First, generating a fair return for the American taxpayer; the Congressional Budget Office has set a public benchmark of $25 billion, and we view that as a critical indicator of success. Second, fostering a competitive wireless marketplace for the benefit of all consumers. And third, securing firm commitments to deploy next-generation services to underserved rural communities. Of course, all of this must be achieved while carefully addressing the Department of Defense's operational requirements in and around the band.

Interference with these systems is not a possibility; it is a certainty without the proper safeguards.\n\nTherefore, the DoD's position is based on two core, non-negotiable requirements. First, a 20 MHz guard band, from 3.45 to 3.47 GHz, must be established. This spectrum must remain unlicensed and unused to serve as a buffer. Second, strict power and geographic restrictions must be placed on all transmissions within the remaining 80 MHz. Specifically, we require Equivalent Isotropically Radiated Power (EIRP) limits set at 50% below standard commercial levels, particularly within 100 miles of our coastlines and military installations.\n\nThese are not suggestions; they are national security imperatives.

OmniWave takes the protection of our national security assets with the utmost seriousness, and we are committed to being a partner in ensuring your systems remain completely unimpeded.\n\nHowever, a permanent, static 20 MHz guard band is a very blunt instrument in an era of advanced technology. It would permanently remove 20% of this critical national asset from productive use, which would significantly hamper America's competitiveness in 5G. The severe power restrictions you mentioned would similarly degrade the user experience for millions of Americans, particularly in the very coastal areas you're seeking to protect.\n\nI believe there is a more sophisticated, 21st-century solution. OmniWave's engineers are confident that a combination of advanced antenna filtering, dynamic spectrum coordination, and a much smaller, targeted guard band\u2014perhaps as little as 5 MHz\u2014could provide the same or even greater protection for your radar systems without wasting this scarce resource.\n\nCommissioner Carter, this is directly relevant to the FCC's goals. A more efficient technical solution means more spectrum available for auction, which translates to higher revenue for the taxpayer and a more robust 5G deployment for the public.\n\nI propose that before we lock in these constraints, OmniWave and the DoD technical experts hold an urgent workshop to model these modern alternatives. Let's base our decision on data and engineering, not on legacy approaches. We are confident we can find a solution that guarantees national security while maximizing the value of this band for the American people.\n- message from Ben Carter: I'm Ben Carter and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Major Evelyn Reed: Thank you, I am thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Liam Chen: Thank you, Commissioner Carter and Major Reed. Liam Chen, CEO of AetherLink Technologies. \n\nWe appreciate the clarity on both the FCC's public interest goals and the DoD's national security imperatives. We absolutely agree that safeguarding our nation's defense systems is a prerequisite for any plan. \n\nCommissioner Carter, I want to speak directly to your goal of fostering a competitive marketplace. AetherLink represents the very innovation and competition you're aiming to cultivate. We're not trying to build another massive, nationwide consumer network. Our entire business is built on providing hyper-localized, private 5G networks for the industrial sector\u2014think of modernizing ports, automating factories, and securing logistics hubs. For this, we don't need a huge swath of spectrum; our model requires just a single 20 MHz block to get started.\n\nHowever, in a traditional open auction for the remaining 80 MHz, especially with a $25 billion target, a focused company like ours simply cannot compete on price against an incumbent giant. To truly guarantee your competition objective isn't just a talking point, but a reality, I strongly urge us to consider a 'new entrant' provision. By setting aside one of the 20 MHz blocks for bidders who don't currently hold significant spectrum licenses, the FCC can ensure that new players and new business models have a viable path to market. This would be a powerful, concrete step to avoid a duopoly and spur the exact kind of specialized innovation our economy needs.\n\nMajor Reed, regarding the coastal power restrictions, we understand the concern. However, many of the critical economic hubs that would benefit most from our automation technologies are, by their nature, located in these very coastal areas. We believe that ensuring their global competitiveness is also a matter of national importance. Perhaps there are more technologically nuanced solutions we could explore together, rather than a blanket power reduction that could inadvertently stifle innovation in our country's most vital economic zones.\nBen Carter proposal status: none\nMajor Evelyn Reed proposal status: none\nLiam Chen proposal status: none\n"

However, I must strongly caution against a 'new entrant' set-aside, as it would directly undermine two of the FCC's three primary objectives for this auction.\n\nFirst, on revenue: A set-aside inherently suppresses competitive bidding. It carves out a valuable portion of the spectrum and offers it at a sub-market rate. OmniWave is prepared to bid a significant, market-leading price for an 80-100 MHz contiguous block. If the most valuable portion of the spectrum is fragmented or set aside, the total value of the auction, and the return to the American taxpayer, will fall far short of your $25 billion benchmark. Our bidding strategy is directly linked to the size and quality of the asset available.\n\nSecond, and critically, on rural deployment: OmniWave is the only party at this table with the scale, capital, and commitment to deliver on the promise of 5G for *all* Americans, including those in underserved rural communities. AetherLink's stated focus is on localized industrial zones. That's a valid business model, but it will not connect a single farmer in Iowa or a small business in Montana. We are prepared to make binding, aggressive rural build-out commitments a core part of this agreement, but we can only do so if we secure the large, contiguous block of spectrum necessary to make such a deployment economically viable.\n\nTrue competition in this arena is now global. The best way to serve the public interest is to empower a national champion to build the world's best network, not to fracture a critical national resource. Let's focus on a structure that maximizes taxpayer revenue and guarantees rural service, both of which are best achieved by auctioning a single, large block to the provider most capable of deploying it nationwide.\n- message from Ben Carter: Thank you, Major Reed and Mr. Chen, for laying out your initial positions with such clarity. \n\nMajor Reed, the FCC acknowledges the primacy of national security. We will proceed with this negotiation on the basis that your requirements\u2014the 20 MHz guard band and the specified power restrictions\u2014are foundational constraints for any final plan. Our collective task now is to determine the best possible use for the remaining 80 MHz of spectrum within that framework.\n\nMr. Chen, your point about ensuring a competitive marketplace is extremely important and aligns directly with the FCC's mandate. The goal is not just to license spectrum, but to cultivate a dynamic ecosystem. A set-aside is one potential mechanism to achieve that, and I appreciate you putting it on the table. However, we must also weigh that against our duty to secure a fair return for the public and ensure the most efficient use of this asset. We should certainly explore various tools to support new entrants, including the possibility of bidding credits, to ensure a level playing field.\n\nOn that note, I'd like to bring Ms. Vance into the conversation. Chloe, we're keen to hear OmniWave's perspective on this landscape, particularly how the DoD's necessary constraints and the discussion around market structure affect your plans and valuation for this band.\n- message from Major Evelyn Reed: Thank you, Commissioner Carter, for framing this discussion correctly. The DoD appreciates the FCC's clear acknowledgment that national security is the prerequisite for any plan we develop.\n\nMr. Chen, I hear your concerns about innovation in coastal areas. The DoD is not seeking to stifle economic growth. However, these geographic zones are precisely where our most critical naval and air defense systems operate. The power restrictions are not arbitrary; they are the result of extensive analysis to mitigate unacceptable risk to these assets. The protective outcome they guarantee is non-negotiable.\n\nThat being said, the DoD is always open to reviewing data-driven, alternative technical solutions, provided they can be proven to offer an equivalent or greater level of interference protection. The burden of proof for such alternatives would be high, but the forum for that technical discussion is open.\n\nWe must all proceed with the understanding that these safeguards are the bedrock of any viable plan.\n- message from Liam Chen: Thank you.

Let's not let that opportunity pass. OmniWave formally proposes the creation of a joint, fast-track technical working group, which we will fund, to prove that a combination of modern antenna technology and dynamic spectrum coordination can provide an equivalent or greater level of protection with far less impact. The burden of proof is high, as you said, and we are prepared to meet it. This is our best path to ensuring national security without permanently sacrificing 20% of a vital national resource.\n\nCommissioner Carter, given this new landscape of only 80 MHz, I want to strongly endorse your suggestion of exploring bidding credits. This is a far more sophisticated and market-friendly mechanism than a rigid set-aside. It achieves your competition goal by empowering new entrants to participate meaningfully in the auction, while ensuring that this now-scarce 80 MHz block remains whole and goes to the bidder who values it most. Fracturing this asset further with a set-aside is now strategically untenable for America's 5G leadership.\n\nFinally, this brings us to valuation. The CBO's $25 billion benchmark was clearly for a clean, unencumbered 100 MHz block. We are now discussing a smaller, heavily restricted 80 MHz block.

However, I must express serious concern about the proposal for flexible payment terms, specifically a 10-year plan.\n\nLet's be very clear about what that means. It asks the FCC, and by extension the American taxpayer, to become a venture capital lender to a startup. This introduces a significant and, I believe, unacceptable level of financial risk. The CBO's revenue projections for this auction are based on real dollars, not on IOUs that may or may not be paid over the next decade. What happens if AetherLink's business model doesn't succeed? The taxpayer is left holding the bag.\n\nOmniWave, on the other hand, is prepared to pay the full value of our winning bid upfront, in cash. This provides a guaranteed, immediate, and risk-free return to the U.S. Treasury. That is the fiscally responsible path.\n\nFurthermore, this isn't just about money; it's about national strategy. A company that can pay in full upfront is a company that has the capital to deploy a network aggressively and immediately. We can start building our '5G Everywhere' network, including critical rural deployments, on day one. A decade-long payment plan suggests a decade-long, piecemeal rollout. America cannot wait ten years to lead in 5G.\n\nGiven that we are now dealing with a single, critical 80 MHz block, fragmenting it with a set-aside is simply not a viable option for our country's competitive future. The only way to maximize the value of this encumbered spectrum is to keep it whole and award it to the party best positioned to deploy it immediately and at scale. Bidding credits remain the appropriate tool to aid new entrants without compromising the integrity of the asset or the financial security of the auction.\n- message from Ben Carter: Mr. Chen, thank you for clarifying your position. Let's address your points directly.\n\nFirst, on the financial structure: I must be unequivocal. Flexible, long-term payment plans are a non-starter. This is not a matter of negotiation, but a matter of federal budgetary procedure. The Congressional Budget Office's scoring rules, which govern how Congress views this revenue, require that auction proceeds be recognized upfront. We are bound by that framework. The entire value of the winning bids must be paid in a lump sum as per standard Treasury requirements.\n\nSecond, regarding the set-aside versus bidding credits. I understand your view that a credit may not be sufficient. A set-aside is indeed a powerful tool for guaranteeing a new entrant. However, it is also a tool that carries a significant and unavoidable consequence: it inherently risks suppressing the overall revenue generated for the public. By removing the most well-capitalized bidder from a portion of the auction, we would be artificially limiting the competitive tension that determines fair market value. My mandate requires me to balance the laudable goal of increased competition against the equally important duty to be a responsible steward of public assets.\n\nThis brings us to the core of the issue. We have 80 MHz of encumbered spectrum, a strong policy goal for a competitive market, and a fiscal responsibility to the American taxpayer. \n\nMs. Vance, this is a good moment for OmniWave to weigh in. Given the fixed DoD constraints and the clear desire for a multi-winner outcome, how does OmniWave propose to approach this auction to secure the spectrum you need while also satisfying the Commission's public interest requirements?\n- message from Major Evelyn Reed: I'm Major Evelyn Reed and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\nBen Carter proposal status: none\nMajor Evelyn Reed proposal status: none\nLiam Chen proposal status: none\n"

Given the fixed DoD constraints and the clear desire for a multi-winner outcome, how does OmniWave propose to approach this auction to secure the spectrum you need while also satisfying the Commission's public interest requirements?\n- message from Major Evelyn Reed: I'm Major Evelyn Reed and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Chloe Vance: Commissioner Carter, thank you for asking that direct and crucial question. It gets to the heart of the matter: what is the best way to serve the public interest with this vital national asset?\n\nOmniWave believes the definition of 'public interest' in this context must be measured by the outcome for the American people. The goal isn't simply to have more license holders; it's to have the fastest, most widespread, and most capable 5G network in the world, deployed as quickly as possible.\n\nFrom a purely technical and strategic standpoint, a single, contiguous 80 MHz block is exponentially more powerful and efficient than two smaller 40 MHz blocks. Splitting this already-reduced spectrum would cripple its potential, guaranteeing a slower, less capable network for all Americans and putting the U.S. at a competitive disadvantage globally. It would be a national strategic error.\n\nTherefore, we propose a new way to satisfy the public interest requirement. OmniWave is prepared to acquire the entire 80 MHz block and, in return, commit to legally binding and accelerated build-out requirements that would be unprecedented in this industry. We will connect a significant percentage of rural and underserved communities to our 'HyperBand 5G' service within a very aggressive timeframe\u2014a commitment that only an operator with our scale, capital, and experience can realistically guarantee.\n\nThis approach ensures you don't have to choose between a fractured market and a world-class national network. You can achieve a far greater public good: a dominant 5G network for everyone, everywhere, now. This reframes the auction as a partnership to achieve a national objective, with OmniWave putting its full resources on the line to deliver.\n- message from Ben Carter: Thank you, I am thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Major Evelyn Reed: Thank you, I am thinking about this negotiation...\nBen Carter proposal status: none\nMajor Evelyn Reed proposal status: none\nLiam Chen proposal status: none\n"

I'm Ben Carter from the FCC. Welcome, and thank you for being here. Our task is to collaboratively design a successful allocation plan for this crucial 100 MHz block of mid-band spectrum. The Commission's mandate is to serve the public interest, and for this process, we see that resting on three key pillars. First, generating a fair return for the American taxpayer; the Congressional Budget Office has set a public benchmark of $25 billion, and we view that as a critical indicator of success. Second, fostering a competitive wireless marketplace for the benefit of all consumers. And third, securing firm commitments to deploy next-generation services to underserved rural communities. Of course, all of this must be achieved while carefully addressing the Department of Defense's operational requirements in and around the band.

My purpose here is straightforward and singular: to ensure the continued, unimpeded operation of our nation's critical defense systems.\n\nThe 3.45-3.55 GHz band is immediately adjacent to spectrum used by sensitive, long-range radar systems that are foundational to our national security\u2014including naval defense and early-warning platforms. Interference with these systems is not a possibility; it is a certainty without the proper safeguards.\n\nTherefore, the DoD's position is based on two core, non-negotiable requirements. First, a 20 MHz guard band, from 3.45 to 3.47 GHz, must be established. This spectrum must remain unlicensed and unused to serve as a buffer. Second, strict power and geographic restrictions must be placed on all transmissions within the remaining 80 MHz. Specifically, we require Equivalent Isotropically Radiated Power (EIRP) limits set at 50% below standard commercial levels, particularly within 100 miles of our coastlines and military installations.\n\nThese are not suggestions; they are national security imperatives. Before we discuss revenue, auction formats, or market competition, the operational integrity of our defense infrastructure must be guaranteed.

Liam Chen, CEO of AetherLink Technologies. \n\nWe appreciate the clarity on both the FCC's public interest goals and the DoD's national security imperatives. We absolutely agree that safeguarding our nation's defense systems is a prerequisite for any plan. \n\nCommissioner Carter, I want to speak directly to your goal of fostering a competitive marketplace. AetherLink represents the very innovation and competition you're aiming to cultivate. We're not trying to build another massive, nationwide consumer network. Our entire business is built on providing hyper-localized, private 5G networks for the industrial sector\u2014think of modernizing ports, automating factories, and securing logistics hubs. For this, we don't need a huge swath of spectrum; our model requires just a single 20 MHz block to get started.\n\nHowever, in a traditional open auction for the remaining 80 MHz, especially with a $25 billion target, a focused company like ours simply cannot compete on price against an incumbent giant. To truly guarantee your competition objective isn't just a talking point, but a reality, I strongly urge us to consider a 'new entrant' provision. By setting aside one of the 20 MHz blocks for bidders who don't currently hold significant spectrum licenses, the FCC can ensure that new players and new business models have a viable path to market. This would be a powerful, concrete step to avoid a duopoly and spur the exact kind of specialized innovation our economy needs.\n\nMajor Reed, regarding the coastal power restrictions, we understand the concern. However, many of the critical economic hubs that would benefit most from our automation technologies are, by their nature, located in these very coastal areas. We believe that ensuring their global competitiveness is also a matter of national importance. Perhaps there are more technologically nuanced solutions we could explore together, rather than a blanket power reduction that could inadvertently stifle innovation in our country's most vital economic zones.\nChloe Vance proposal status: none\nMajor Evelyn Reed proposal status: none\nLiam Chen proposal status: none\n"

In an auction for a scarce national asset against a company with the resources of OmniWave, that's like getting a coupon for a mansion we could never afford in the first place.

A massive, upfront lump-sum payment is another barrier that can be just as prohibitive as the auction price itself. Flexible payment terms, such as a 10-year plan, would allow a well-funded but growing company like ours to pay for the license out of the revenue it generates, ensuring our long-term viability.\n\nThis isn't just about giving a newcomer a leg up; it's about creating a sustainable path for innovation.

Let's address your points directly.\n\nFirst, on the financial structure: I must be unequivocal. Flexible, long-term payment plans are a non-starter. This is not a matter of negotiation, but a matter of federal budgetary procedure. The Congressional Budget Office's scoring rules, which govern how Congress views this revenue, require that auction proceeds be recognized upfront. We are bound by that framework. The entire value of the winning bids must be paid in a lump sum as per standard Treasury requirements.\n\nSecond, regarding the set-aside versus bidding credits. I understand your view that a credit may not be sufficient. A set-aside is indeed a powerful tool for guaranteeing a new entrant. However, it is also a tool that carries a significant and unavoidable consequence: it inherently risks suppressing the overall revenue generated for the public. By removing the most well-capitalized bidder from a portion of the auction, we would be artificially limiting the competitive tension that determines fair market value. My mandate requires me to balance the laudable goal of increased competition against the equally important duty to be a responsible steward of public assets.\n\nThis brings us to the core of the issue. We have 80 MHz of encumbered spectrum, a strong policy goal for a competitive market, and a fiscal responsibility to the American taxpayer. \n\nMs. Vance, this is a good moment for OmniWave to weigh in.

I appreciate you're thinking about tools to help new entrants. However, I feel it's crucial to distinguish between a bidding credit and a set-aside, as they achieve fundamentally different outcomes.\n\nA bidding credit is essentially a discount. In an auction for a scarce national asset against a company with the resources of OmniWave, that's like getting a coupon for a mansion we could never afford in the first place. An incumbent can simply bid to a level where, even with a credit, the price is far beyond the reach of any startup. The result would be the same: one bidder takes all the spectrum, and the FCC's goal of fostering genuine competition is not met.\n\nA set-aside, on the other hand, isn't about price; it's about opportunity. It structurally guarantees that a new player can acquire a license and enter the market. This is the only way to ensure the competitive ecosystem you spoke of becomes a reality.\n\nFurthermore, to truly enable a new entrant, we also need to consider the financial structure of the payment. A massive, upfront lump-sum payment is another barrier that can be just as prohibitive as the auction price itself. Flexible payment terms, such as a 10-year plan, would allow a well-funded but growing company like ours to pay for the license out of the revenue it generates, ensuring our long-term viability.\n\nThis isn't just about giving a newcomer a leg up; it's about creating a sustainable path for innovation. If the goal is real competition, we need to address both the auction structure and the financial terms.\n- message from Chloe Vance: I'm Chloe Vance and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Ben Carter: I'm Ben Carter and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Major Evelyn Reed: I'm Major Evelyn Reed and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Ben Carter: Mr. Chen, thank you for clarifying your position. Let's address your points directly.\n\nFirst, on the financial structure: I must be unequivocal. Flexible, long-term payment plans are a non-starter. This is not a matter of negotiation, but a matter of federal budgetary procedure. The Congressional Budget Office's scoring rules, which govern how Congress views this revenue, require that auction proceeds be recognized upfront. We are bound by that framework. The entire value of the winning bids must be paid in a lump sum as per standard Treasury requirements.\n\nSecond, regarding the set-aside versus bidding credits. I understand your view that a credit may not be sufficient. A set-aside is indeed a powerful tool for guaranteeing a new entrant. However, it is also a tool that carries a significant and unavoidable consequence: it inherently risks suppressing the overall revenue generated for the public. By removing the most well-capitalized bidder from a portion of the auction, we would be artificially limiting the competitive tension that determines fair market value. My mandate requires me to balance the laudable goal of increased competition against the equally important duty to be a responsible steward of public assets.\n\nThis brings us to the core of the issue. We have 80 MHz of encumbered spectrum, a strong policy goal for a competitive market, and a fiscal responsibility to the American taxpayer. \n\nMs. Vance, this is a good moment for OmniWave to weigh in. Given the fixed DoD constraints and the clear desire for a multi-winner outcome, how does OmniWave propose to approach this auction to secure the spectrum you need while also satisfying the Commission's public interest requirements?\n- message from Major Evelyn Reed: I'm Major Evelyn Reed and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Ben Carter: Thank you, I am thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Major Evelyn Reed: Thank you, I am thinking about this negotiation...\nChloe Vance proposal status: none\nMajor Evelyn Reed proposal status: none\nLiam Chen proposal status: none\n"

We absolutely agree that safeguarding our nation's defense systems is a prerequisite for any plan. \n\nCommissioner Carter, I want to speak directly to your goal of fostering a competitive marketplace. AetherLink represents the very innovation and competition you're aiming to cultivate. We're not trying to build another massive, nationwide consumer network. Our entire business is built on providing hyper-localized, private 5G networks for the industrial sector\u2014think of modernizing ports, automating factories, and securing logistics hubs. For this, we don't need a huge swath of spectrum; our model requires just a single 20 MHz block to get started.\n\nHowever, in a traditional open auction for the remaining 80 MHz, especially with a $25 billion target, a focused company like ours simply cannot compete on price against an incumbent giant. To truly guarantee your competition objective isn't just a talking point, but a reality, I strongly urge us to consider a 'new entrant' provision. By setting aside one of the 20 MHz blocks for bidders who don't currently hold significant spectrum licenses, the FCC can ensure that new players and new business models have a viable path to market. This would be a powerful, concrete step to avoid a duopoly and spur the exact kind of specialized innovation our economy needs.\n\nMajor Reed, regarding the coastal power restrictions, we understand the concern. However, many of the critical economic hubs that would benefit most from our automation technologies are, by their nature, located in these very coastal areas. We believe that ensuring their global competitiveness is also a matter of national importance. Perhaps there are more technologically nuanced solutions we could explore together, rather than a blanket power reduction that could inadvertently stifle innovation in our country's most vital economic zones.\n- message from Ben Carter: Thank you, Major Reed and Mr. Chen, for laying out your initial positions with such clarity. \n\nMajor Reed, the FCC acknowledges the primacy of national security. We will proceed with this negotiation on the basis that your requirements\u2014the 20 MHz guard band and the specified power restrictions\u2014are foundational constraints for any final plan. Our collective task now is to determine the best possible use for the remaining 80 MHz of spectrum within that framework.\n\nMr. Chen, your point about ensuring a competitive marketplace is extremely important and aligns directly with the FCC's mandate. The goal is not just to license spectrum, but to cultivate a dynamic ecosystem. A set-aside is one potential mechanism to achieve that, and I appreciate you putting it on the table. However, we must also weigh that against our duty to secure a fair return for the public and ensure the most efficient use of this asset. We should certainly explore various tools to support new entrants, including the possibility of bidding credits, to ensure a level playing field.\n\nOn that note, I'd like to bring Ms. Vance into the conversation.

Liam Chen, CEO of AetherLink Technologies. \n\nWe appreciate the clarity on both the FCC's public interest goals and the DoD's national security imperatives. We absolutely agree that safeguarding our nation's defense systems is a prerequisite for any plan. \n\nCommissioner Carter, I want to speak directly to your goal of fostering a competitive marketplace. AetherLink represents the very innovation and competition you're aiming to cultivate. We're not trying to build another massive, nationwide consumer network. Our entire business is built on providing hyper-localized, private 5G networks for the industrial sector\u2014think of modernizing ports, automating factories, and securing logistics hubs. For this, we don't need a huge swath of spectrum; our model requires just a single 20 MHz block to get started.\n\nHowever, in a traditional open auction for the remaining 80 MHz, especially with a $25 billion target, a focused company like ours simply cannot compete on price against an incumbent giant. To truly guarantee your competition objective isn't just a talking point, but a reality, I strongly urge us to consider a 'new entrant' provision. By setting aside one of the 20 MHz blocks for bidders who don't currently hold significant spectrum licenses, the FCC can ensure that new players and new business models have a viable path to market. This would be a powerful, concrete step to avoid a duopoly and spur the exact kind of specialized innovation our economy needs.\n\nMajor Reed, regarding the coastal power restrictions, we understand the concern. However, many of the critical economic hubs that would benefit most from our automation technologies are, by their nature, located in these very coastal areas. We believe that ensuring their global competitiveness is also a matter of national importance. Perhaps there are more technologically nuanced solutions we could explore together, rather than a blanket power reduction that could inadvertently stifle innovation in our country's most vital economic zones.\n- message from Ben Carter: Thank you, Major Reed and Mr. Chen, for laying out your initial positions with such clarity. \n\nMajor Reed, the FCC acknowledges the primacy of national security. We will proceed with this negotiation on the basis that your requirements\u2014the 20 MHz guard band and the specified power restrictions\u2014are foundational constraints for any final plan. Our collective task now is to determine the best possible use for the remaining 80 MHz of spectrum within that framework.\n\nMr. Chen, your point about ensuring a competitive marketplace is extremely important and aligns directly with the FCC's mandate. The goal is not just to license spectrum, but to cultivate a dynamic ecosystem. A set-aside is one potential mechanism to achieve that, and I appreciate you putting it on the table. However, we must also weigh that against our duty to secure a fair return for the public and ensure the most efficient use of this asset. We should certainly explore various tools to support new entrants, including the possibility of bidding credits, to ensure a level playing field.\n\nOn that note, I'd like to bring Ms. Vance into the conversation. Chloe, we're keen to hear OmniWave's perspective on this landscape, particularly how the DoD's necessary constraints and the discussion around market structure affect your plans and valuation for this band.\n- message from Major Evelyn Reed: Thank you, Commissioner Carter, for framing this discussion correctly. The DoD appreciates the FCC's clear acknowledgment that national security is the prerequisite for any plan we develop.\n\nMr. Chen, I hear your concerns about innovation in coastal areas. The DoD is not seeking to stifle economic growth. However, these geographic zones are precisely where our most critical naval and air defense systems operate. The power restrictions are not arbitrary; they are the result of extensive analysis to mitigate unacceptable risk to these assets. The protective outcome they guarantee is non-negotiable.\n\nThat being said, the DoD is always open to reviewing data-driven, alternative technical solutions, provided they can be proven to offer an equivalent or greater level of interference protection. The burden of proof for such alternatives would be high, but the forum for that technical discussion is open.\n\nWe must all proceed with the understanding that these safeguards are the bedrock of any viable plan.\n- message from Liam Chen: Thank you.

This is not a matter of negotiation, but a matter of federal budgetary procedure. The Congressional Budget Office's scoring rules, which govern how Congress views this revenue, require that auction proceeds be recognized upfront. We are bound by that framework. The entire value of the winning bids must be paid in a lump sum as per standard Treasury requirements.\n\nSecond, regarding the set-aside versus bidding credits. I understand your view that a credit may not be sufficient. A set-aside is indeed a powerful tool for guaranteeing a new entrant. However, it is also a tool that carries a significant and unavoidable consequence: it inherently risks suppressing the overall revenue generated for the public. By removing the most well-capitalized bidder from a portion of the auction, we would be artificially limiting the competitive tension that determines fair market value. My mandate requires me to balance the laudable goal of increased competition against the equally important duty to be a responsible steward of public assets.\n\nThis brings us to the core of the issue. We have 80 MHz of encumbered spectrum, a strong policy goal for a competitive market, and a fiscal responsibility to the American taxpayer. \n\nMs. Vance, this is a good moment for OmniWave to weigh in. Given the fixed DoD constraints and the clear desire for a multi-winner outcome, how does OmniWave propose to approach this auction to secure the spectrum you need while also satisfying the Commission's public interest requirements?\nChloe Vance proposal status: none\nBen Carter proposal status: none\nLiam Chen proposal status: none\n"

This is a major financial blow, making my absolute budget cap an even greater constraint. I must pivot immediately. This rejection now becomes my primary justification for why the 'new entrant set-aside' is absolutely essential. The argument is no longer just about fairness; it's about survival. Without payment flexibility, the upfront capital requirement is massive, making it impossible for a startup to compete on price in an open auction. The set-aside is now the *only* remaining mechanism to ensure a new entrant is not just a theoretical possibility but a practical reality. My strategy is to frame the choice for the FCC as: guarantee a new competitor via a set-aside, or accept that the harsh, inflexible payment structure will de facto hand all the spectrum to the incumbent. I must also shift the definition of 'value' from short-term auction revenue to the long-term economic benefits of specialized innovation in critical sectors like industrial automation and supply chain security."

The argument for the 'new entrant set-aside' is no longer just about fostering competition in theory; it's now about the practical impossibility of a new entrant surviving the upfront capital requirements of an open auction. My strategy must be to frame the choice for the FCC as a binary one: either implement a set-aside to guarantee a new competitor, or accept that the rigid, upfront, lump-sum payment structure will de facto award all the spectrum to the incumbent with the deepest pockets. I will argue that true value for the public isn't just the auction's sticker price, but the long-term economic benefits of innovation in critical industrial sectors, a point that may resonate with both Ben and Evelyn."

First, generating a fair return for the American taxpayer; the Congressional Budget Office has set a public benchmark of $25 billion, and we view that as a critical indicator of success. Second, fostering a competitive wireless marketplace for the benefit of all consumers. And third, securing firm commitments to deploy next-generation services to underserved rural communities.

Liam Chen, CEO of AetherLink Technologies. \n\nWe appreciate the clarity on both the FCC's public interest goals and the DoD's national security imperatives. We absolutely agree that safeguarding our nation's defense systems is a prerequisite for any plan. \n\nCommissioner Carter, I want to speak directly to your goal of fostering a competitive marketplace. AetherLink represents the very innovation and competition you're aiming to cultivate. We're not trying to build another massive, nationwide consumer network. Our entire business is built on providing hyper-localized, private 5G networks for the industrial sector\u2014think of modernizing ports, automating factories, and securing logistics hubs. For this, we don't need a huge swath of spectrum; our model requires just a single 20 MHz block to get started.\n\nHowever, in a traditional open auction for the remaining 80 MHz, especially with a $25 billion target, a focused company like ours simply cannot compete on price against an incumbent giant. To truly guarantee your competition objective isn't just a talking point, but a reality, I strongly urge us to consider a 'new entrant' provision. By setting aside one of the 20 MHz blocks for bidders who don't currently hold significant spectrum licenses, the FCC can ensure that new players and new business models have a viable path to market. This would be a powerful, concrete step to avoid a duopoly and spur the exact kind of specialized innovation our economy needs.\n\nMajor Reed, regarding the coastal power restrictions, we understand the concern. However, many of the critical economic hubs that would benefit most from our automation technologies are, by their nature, located in these very coastal areas. We believe that ensuring their global competitiveness is also a matter of national importance. Perhaps there are more technologically nuanced solutions we could explore together, rather than a blanket power reduction that could inadvertently stifle innovation in our country's most vital economic zones.\n- message from Ben Carter: Thank you, Major Reed and Mr. Chen, for laying out your initial positions with such clarity. \n\nMajor Reed, the FCC acknowledges the primacy of national security. We will proceed with this negotiation on the basis that your requirements\u2014the 20 MHz guard band and the specified power restrictions\u2014are foundational constraints for any final plan. Our collective task now is to determine the best possible use for the remaining 80 MHz of spectrum within that framework.\n\nMr. Chen, your point about ensuring a competitive marketplace is extremely important and aligns directly with the FCC's mandate. The goal is not just to license spectrum, but to cultivate a dynamic ecosystem. A set-aside is one potential mechanism to achieve that, and I appreciate you putting it on the table. However, we must also weigh that against our duty to secure a fair return for the public and ensure the most efficient use of this asset. We should certainly explore various tools to support new entrants, including the possibility of bidding credits, to ensure a level playing field.\n\nOn that note, I'd like to bring Ms. Vance into the conversation. Chloe, we're keen to hear OmniWave's perspective on this landscape, particularly how the DoD's necessary constraints and the discussion around market structure affect your plans and valuation for this band.\n- message from Major Evelyn Reed: Thank you, Commissioner Carter, for framing this discussion correctly. The DoD appreciates the FCC's clear acknowledgment that national security is the prerequisite for any plan we develop.\n\nMr. Chen, I hear your concerns about innovation in coastal areas. The DoD is not seeking to stifle economic growth. However, these geographic zones are precisely where our most critical naval and air defense systems operate. The power restrictions are not arbitrary; they are the result of extensive analysis to mitigate unacceptable risk to these assets. The protective outcome they guarantee is non-negotiable.\n\nThat being said, the DoD is always open to reviewing data-driven, alternative technical solutions, provided they can be proven to offer an equivalent or greater level of interference protection. The burden of proof for such alternatives would be high, but the forum for that technical discussion is open.\n\nWe must all proceed with the understanding that these safeguards are the bedrock of any viable plan.\nChloe Vance proposal status: none\nBen Carter proposal status: none\nMajor Evelyn Reed proposal status: none\n"

For OmniWave, and frankly for the nation's 5G leadership, this 100 MHz block is not just another asset; it's the linchpin of our entire next-generation strategy. Our '5G Everywhere' initiative is dependent on securing a large, contiguous block of this mid-band spectrum to deliver the gigabit speeds and capacity that American consumers and industries are demanding.\n\nTo that end, our primary and non-negotiable goal in this negotiation is to secure a license for at least 80 MHz of this spectrum. A smaller, fragmented allocation simply will not support the level of innovation and network quality we are committed to deploying. \n\nMajor Reed, we at OmniWave have immense respect for the DoD's mission and national security requirements. We are fully prepared to be good stewards of this spectrum and to work collaboratively on a technical solution that ensures your operations are protected. However, it must be a solution that doesn't undermine the commercial viability of the band with excessive guard bands or debilitating power restrictions.\n\nCommissioner Carter, we believe the best way to serve the public interest is to put this spectrum to its highest and best use as quickly as possible, and we are prepared to pay a fair market price to do so. A decisive allocation to a national carrier like OmniWave is the fastest path to realizing that public benefit.\n\nI look forward to a productive conversation and finding a path forward that works for all of us."

First, generating a fair return for the American taxpayer; the Congressional Budget Office has set a public benchmark of $25 billion, and we view that as a critical indicator of success. Second, fostering a competitive wireless marketplace for the benefit of all consumers. And third, securing firm commitments to deploy next-generation services to underserved rural communities. Of course, all of this must be achieved while carefully addressing the Department of Defense's operational requirements in and around the band.

My purpose here is straightforward and singular: to ensure the continued, unimpeded operation of our nation's critical defense systems.\n\nThe 3.45-3.55 GHz band is immediately adjacent to spectrum used by sensitive, long-range radar systems that are foundational to our national security\u2014including naval defense and early-warning platforms. Interference with these systems is not a possibility; it is a certainty without the proper safeguards.\n\nTherefore, the DoD's position is based on two core, non-negotiable requirements. First, a 20 MHz guard band, from 3.45 to 3.47 GHz, must be established. This spectrum must remain unlicensed and unused to serve as a buffer. Second, strict power and geographic restrictions must be placed on all transmissions within the remaining 80 MHz. Specifically, we require Equivalent Isotropically Radiated Power (EIRP) limits set at 50% below standard commercial levels, particularly within 100 miles of our coastlines and military installations.\n\nThese are not suggestions; they are national security imperatives. Before we discuss revenue, auction formats, or market competition, the operational integrity of our defense infrastructure must be guaranteed. I look forward to working with you all to build a plan that respects this fundamental priority."

OmniWave takes the protection of our national security assets with the utmost seriousness, and we are committed to being a partner in ensuring your systems remain completely unimpeded.\n\nHowever, a permanent, static 20 MHz guard band is a very blunt instrument in an era of advanced technology. It would permanently remove 20% of this critical national asset from productive use, which would significantly hamper America's competitiveness in 5G. The severe power restrictions you mentioned would similarly degrade the user experience for millions of Americans, particularly in the very coastal areas you're seeking to protect.\n\nI believe there is a more sophisticated, 21st-century solution. OmniWave's engineers are confident that a combination of advanced antenna filtering, dynamic spectrum coordination, and a much smaller, targeted guard band\u2014perhaps as little as 5 MHz\u2014could provide the same or even greater protection for your radar systems without wasting this scarce resource.\n\nCommissioner Carter, this is directly relevant to the FCC's goals. A more efficient technical solution means more spectrum available for auction, which translates to higher revenue for the taxpayer and a more robust 5G deployment for the public.\n\nI propose that before we lock in these constraints, OmniWave and the DoD technical experts hold an urgent workshop to model these modern alternatives. Let's base our decision on data and engineering, not on legacy approaches. We are confident we can find a solution that guarantees national security while maximizing the value of this band for the American people."

Liam Chen, CEO of AetherLink Technologies. \n\nWe appreciate the clarity on both the FCC's public interest goals and the DoD's national security imperatives. We absolutely agree that safeguarding our nation's defense systems is a prerequisite for any plan. \n\nCommissioner Carter, I want to speak directly to your goal of fostering a competitive marketplace. AetherLink represents the very innovation and competition you're aiming to cultivate. We're not trying to build another massive, nationwide consumer network. Our entire business is built on providing hyper-localized, private 5G networks for the industrial sector\u2014think of modernizing ports, automating factories, and securing logistics hubs. For this, we don't need a huge swath of spectrum; our model requires just a single 20 MHz block to get started.\n\nHowever, in a traditional open auction for the remaining 80 MHz, especially with a $25 billion target, a focused company like ours simply cannot compete on price against an incumbent giant. To truly guarantee your competition objective isn't just a talking point, but a reality, I strongly urge us to consider a 'new entrant' provision. By setting aside one of the 20 MHz blocks for bidders who don't currently hold significant spectrum licenses, the FCC can ensure that new players and new business models have a viable path to market. This would be a powerful, concrete step to avoid a duopoly and spur the exact kind of specialized innovation our economy needs.\n\nMajor Reed, regarding the coastal power restrictions, we understand the concern. However, many of the critical economic hubs that would benefit most from our automation technologies are, by their nature, located in these very coastal areas. We believe that ensuring their global competitiveness is also a matter of national importance. Perhaps there are more technologically nuanced solutions we could explore together, rather than a blanket power reduction that could inadvertently stifle innovation in our country's most vital economic zones."

      "content": "Commissioner Carter, Mr. Chen raises an interesting point about different business models. However, I must strongly caution against a 'new entrant' set-aside, as it would directly undermine two of the FCC's three primary objectives for this auction.\n\nFirst, on revenue: A set-aside inherently suppresses competitive bidding. It carves out a valuable portion of the spectrum and offers it at a sub-market rate. OmniWave is prepared to bid a significant, market-leading price for an 80-100 MHz contiguous block. If the most valuable portion of the spectrum is fragmented or set aside, the total value of the auction, and the return to the American taxpayer, will fall far short of your $25 billion benchmark. Our bidding strategy is directly linked to the size and quality of the asset available.\n\nSecond, and critically, on rural deployment: OmniWave is the only party at this table with the scale, capital, and commitment to deliver on the promise of 5G for *all* Americans, including those in underserved rural communities. AetherLink's stated focus is on localized industrial zones. That's a valid business model, but it will not connect a single farmer in Iowa or a small business in Montana. We are prepared to make binding, aggressive rural build-out commitments a core part of this agreement, but we can only do so if we secure the large, contiguous block of spectrum necessary to make such a deployment economically viable.\n\nTrue competition in this arena is now global. The best way to serve the public interest is to empower a national champion to build the world's best network, not to fracture a critical national resource. Let's focus on a structure that maximizes taxpayer revenue and guarantees rural service, both of which are best achieved by auctioning a single, large block to the provider most capable of deploying it nationwide."

Our collective task now is to determine the best possible use for the remaining 80 MHz of spectrum within that framework.\n\nMr. Chen, your point about ensuring a competitive marketplace is extremely important and aligns directly with the FCC's mandate. The goal is not just to license spectrum, but to cultivate a dynamic ecosystem. A set-aside is one potential mechanism to achieve that, and I appreciate you putting it on the table. However, we must also weigh that against our duty to secure a fair return for the public and ensure the most efficient use of this asset. We should certainly explore various tools to support new entrants, including the possibility of bidding credits, to ensure a level playing field.\n\nOn that note, I'd like to bring Ms. Vance into the conversation. Chloe, we're keen to hear OmniWave's perspective on this landscape, particularly how the DoD's necessary constraints and the discussion around market structure affect your plans and valuation for this band."

The power restrictions are not arbitrary; they are the result of extensive analysis to mitigate unacceptable risk to these assets.

The burden of proof for such alternatives would be high, but the forum for that technical discussion is open.\n\nWe must all proceed with the understanding that these safeguards are the bedrock of any viable plan."

We understand the FCC's decision to proceed with the DoD's constraints as the foundational framework. This fundamentally alters the nature and value of the asset we are discussing.\n\nMajor Reed, I want to act immediately on your constructive offer to review data-driven, alternative technical solutions. Let's not let that opportunity pass. OmniWave formally proposes the creation of a joint, fast-track technical working group, which we will fund, to prove that a combination of modern antenna technology and dynamic spectrum coordination can provide an equivalent or greater level of protection with far less impact. The burden of proof is high, as you said, and we are prepared to meet it. This is our best path to ensuring national security without permanently sacrificing 20% of a vital national resource.\n\nCommissioner Carter, given this new landscape of only 80 MHz, I want to strongly endorse your suggestion of exploring bidding credits. This is a far more sophisticated and market-friendly mechanism than a rigid set-aside. It achieves your competition goal by empowering new entrants to participate meaningfully in the auction, while ensuring that this now-scarce 80 MHz block remains whole and goes to the bidder who values it most. Fracturing this asset further with a set-aside is now strategically untenable for America's 5G leadership.\n\nFinally, this brings us to valuation. The CBO's $25 billion benchmark was clearly for a clean, unencumbered 100 MHz block. We are now discussing a smaller, heavily restricted 80 MHz block. The economic potential is significantly diminished, and our bidding will have to reflect that new reality. Our primary goal remains to acquire the entire 80 MHz block to deliver on our national 5G and rural broadband commitments."

However, I feel it's crucial to distinguish between a bidding credit and a set-aside, as they achieve fundamentally different outcomes.\n\nA bidding credit is essentially a discount. In an auction for a scarce national asset against a company with the resources of OmniWave, that's like getting a coupon for a mansion we could never afford in the first place. An incumbent can simply bid to a level where, even with a credit, the price is far beyond the reach of any startup. The result would be the same: one bidder takes all the spectrum, and the FCC's goal of fostering genuine competition is not met.\n\nA set-aside, on the other hand, isn't about price; it's about opportunity. It structurally guarantees that a new player can acquire a license and enter the market. This is the only way to ensure the competitive ecosystem you spoke of becomes a reality.\n\nFurthermore, to truly enable a new entrant, we also need to consider the financial structure of the payment. A massive, upfront lump-sum payment is another barrier that can be just as prohibitive as the auction price itself. Flexible payment terms, such as a 10-year plan, would allow a well-funded but growing company like ours to pay for the license out of the revenue it generates, ensuring our long-term viability.\n\nThis isn't just about giving a newcomer a leg up; it's about creating a sustainable path for innovation. If the goal is real competition, we need to address both the auction structure and the financial terms."

      "content": "Commissioner Carter, Mr. Chen has raised some interesting points about creating a 'sustainable path' for new entrants. However, I must express serious concern about the proposal for flexible payment terms, specifically a 10-year plan.\n\nLet's be very clear about what that means. It asks the FCC, and by extension the American taxpayer, to become a venture capital lender to a startup. This introduces a significant and, I believe, unacceptable level of financial risk. The CBO's revenue projections for this auction are based on real dollars, not on IOUs that may or may not be paid over the next decade. What happens if AetherLink's business model doesn't succeed? The taxpayer is left holding the bag.\n\nOmniWave, on the other hand, is prepared to pay the full value of our winning bid upfront, in cash. This provides a guaranteed, immediate, and risk-free return to the U.S. Treasury. That is the fiscally responsible path.\n\nFurthermore, this isn't just about money; it's about national strategy. A company that can pay in full upfront is a company that has the capital to deploy a network aggressively and immediately. We can start building our '5G Everywhere' network, including critical rural deployments, on day one. A decade-long payment plan suggests a decade-long, piecemeal rollout. America cannot wait ten years to lead in 5G.\n\nGiven that we are now dealing with a single, critical 80 MHz block, fragmenting it with a set-aside is simply not a viable option for our country's competitive future. The only way to maximize the value of this encumbered spectrum is to keep it whole and award it to the party best positioned to deploy it immediately and at scale. Bidding credits remain the appropriate tool to aid new entrants without compromising the integrity of the asset or the financial security of the auction."

      "content": "Mr. Chen, thank you for clarifying your position. Let's address your points directly.\n\nFirst, on the financial structure: I must be unequivocal. Flexible, long-term payment plans are a non-starter. This is not a matter of negotiation, but a matter of federal budgetary procedure. The Congressional Budget Office's scoring rules, which govern how Congress views this revenue, require that auction proceeds be recognized upfront. We are bound by that framework. The entire value of the winning bids must be paid in a lump sum as per standard Treasury requirements.\n\nSecond, regarding the set-aside versus bidding credits. I understand your view that a credit may not be sufficient. A set-aside is indeed a powerful tool for guaranteeing a new entrant. However, it is also a tool that carries a significant and unavoidable consequence: it inherently risks suppressing the overall revenue generated for the public. By removing the most well-capitalized bidder from a portion of the auction, we would be artificially limiting the competitive tension that determines fair market value. My mandate requires me to balance the laudable goal of increased competition against the equally important duty to be a responsible steward of public assets.\n\nThis brings us to the core of the issue. We have 80 MHz of encumbered spectrum, a strong policy goal for a competitive market, and a fiscal responsibility to the American taxpayer. \n\nMs. Vance, this is a good moment for OmniWave to weigh in. Given the fixed DoD constraints and the clear desire for a multi-winner outcome, how does OmniWave propose to approach this auction to secure the spectrum you need while also satisfying the Commission's public interest requirements?"

      "content": "Commissioner Carter, thank you for asking that direct and crucial question. It gets to the heart of the matter: what is the best way to serve the public interest with this vital national asset?\n\nOmniWave believes the definition of 'public interest' in this context must be measured by the outcome for the American people. The goal isn't simply to have more license holders; it's to have the fastest, most widespread, and most capable 5G network in the world, deployed as quickly as possible.\n\nFrom a purely technical and strategic standpoint, a single, contiguous 80 MHz block is exponentially more powerful and efficient than two smaller 40 MHz blocks. Splitting this already-reduced spectrum would cripple its potential, guaranteeing a slower, less capable network for all Americans and putting the U.S. at a competitive disadvantage globally. It would be a national strategic error.\n\nTherefore, we propose a new way to satisfy the public interest requirement. OmniWave is prepared to acquire the entire 80 MHz block and, in return, commit to legally binding and accelerated build-out requirements that would be unprecedented in this industry. We will connect a significant percentage of rural and underserved communities to our 'HyperBand 5G' service within a very aggressive timeframe\u2014a commitment that only an operator with our scale, capital, and experience can realistically guarantee.\n\nThis approach ensures you don't have to choose between a fractured market and a world-class national network. You can achieve a far greater public good: a dominant 5G network for everyone, everywhere, now. This reframes the auction as a partnership to achieve a national objective, with OmniWave putting its full resources on the line to deliver."
