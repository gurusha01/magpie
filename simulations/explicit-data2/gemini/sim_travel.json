The plan must cover the venue, schedule, security protocols, and budget. The negotiation is complicated by conflicting priorities, severe budget constraints, unshared intelligence on security threats, and clandestine political objectives that could derail the entire summit if mishandled.",

I must pivot to a 5-star hotel and frame this concession as a gesture of goodwill. There is a severe conflict between my security chief, Thorne, and his Kasnian counterpart, Morozov, over command structure. I will publicly support a 'joint' or 'integrated' security command to build trust and rapport with the Kasnian delegation, which is critical for my primary (secret) objective. I must manage my own team's security and budget concerns, as they are secondary to building the political capital needed to secure the basing rights agreement with Minister Rostova.

I must reframe this 'non-central' location as a secure, focused 'working retreat' to control the narrative and prevent it from looking like a clandestine meeting. The goodwill generated by these concessions is more valuable than winning on venue prestige or absolute security control, as it directly serves the goal of securing the basing rights agreement."

They have now made the dinner at the Kasnian Embassy a 'non-negotiable point of national honor' and the associated motorcade a 'test' of our partnership. This is no longer a logistical issue, but a political one. Siding with Thorne will destroy the trust needed for my primary objective (basing rights). I must overrule him, reaffirm the 'Joint Command' principle, and concede on the embassy dinner. The political capital from this concession is essential. I will need to work with Dr. Sharma to manage the logistical and political fallout of the motorcade in Sonderland."

This allows me to preserve the goodwill I generated by siding with Rostova, which is critical for my primary objective (basing rights). Her proposed security structure (Sonderland lead, with Thorne and Morozov as equal deputies) also resolves the internal conflict between my security chief's doctrine and Kasnia's demand for partnership.

Colonel Morozov's insistence on codifying 'formal intelligence sharing' is a welcome development, as it creates a perfect precedent and entry point for my primary objective: the confidential signals intelligence outpost.

I must overrule Thorne again; the political trust gained by siding with Rostova is absolutely essential for my primary objective and far outweighs Thorne's doctrinal security concerns. Rostova's $500M economic demand is the key\u2014I will accept it in principle as the summit's central agenda item, but hold back on any firm commitment.

Deliverable: A single, finalized 'Memorandum of Understanding for Summit Logistics and Security' document, co-signed by all six parties, detailing the venue, schedule, budget, and security arrangements.\n- message from Ambassador Elena Vance: Colleagues, thank you all for joining this crucial planning session. The summit between the United States and the Republic of Kasnia represents a pivotal moment\u2014a chance to forge a new era of strategic partnership that will benefit not only our nations but the entire region. The success of our work here will lay the foundation for that historic outcome.\n\nTo that end, the setting for our discussions is of paramount importance. It must reflect the gravity and promise of this occasion. I propose we formally request the Sonderland Grand Governmental Palace as our venue. A location of such prestige sends a clear, public message of transparency, commitment, and mutual respect. Dr. Sharma, we would be deeply honored if Sonderland would consider hosting us in such a distinguished setting.\n\nI believe a strong, confident start is essential. I look forward to hearing your initial thoughts.\n- message from Markus Thorne: Ambassador Vance, I understand the desire for a prestigious venue. However, my assessment must be based purely on security. A high-profile, public location like the Grand Governmental Palace is a significant and predictable target. Its defensibility is questionable, and establishing a truly secure perimeter would be a logistical nightmare.\n\nMy primary function here is to guarantee your safety and the integrity of this summit. Given the current threat environment, which I assess as severe and credible, my baseline requirements are not flexible. Before we can evaluate any venue, we must agree on the foundational security protocols.\n\nFirst, we will require a 500-meter exclusive security perimeter, a 'sterile zone' controlled solely by my DSS team. Second, all personnel with any access to the venue or the delegations must be vetted by U.S. intelligence. Third, all transportation for our delegation will be handled by our own armored vehicles, on routes that we have swept and secured.\n\nThe viability of any proposed location, including the Palace, will be judged against its ability to support these essential countermeasures. The safety of the principals is the one area where there can be no compromise.\n- message from Chloe Sterling: Ambassador Vance, I appreciate the desire for a venue that reflects the summit's importance. However, I have to echo and amplify Mr. Thorne's concerns, but from a fiscal perspective.\n\nMr. Thorne, you used the term 'logistical nightmare' to describe securing the Grand Governmental Palace. In my world, 'logistical nightmare' is a synonym for 'budgetary black hole.' The resources required to establish a 500-meter sterile zone, vet all personnel, and manage transport in a dense, public area would be astronomical. We could easily consume a significant portion of our entire mission budget on securing the venue alone.\n\nMy role is to ensure this summit is executed successfully *within* the strict financial framework allocated by the State Department. We must find a solution that is both secure and cost-effective. A high-profile public venue, while symbolically powerful, seems to present an unacceptable level of financial risk from the outset. We should be considering locations that offer more inherent security and control, which will, in turn, be more fiscally responsible to manage.\n- message from Minister Kaelen Rostova: I'm Minister Kaelen Rostova and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Colonel Ivan Morozov: Mr. Thorne, your commitment to security is noted and, in principle, shared. The safety of the principals is indeed the paramount concern. However, your 'foundational security protocols' are foundationally flawed. They seem to be based on the assumption that the Kasnian Presidential Guard are merely observers in our own minister's protection. Let me be unequivocally clear: that is not the case.\n\nTo suggest that a 'sterile zone' would be controlled 'solely' by your DSS team is a grave insult to the competence of my men and the sovereignty of my nation. Minister Rostova is a Kasnian official, and her primary protection is, and always will be, the responsibility of the Kasnian Presidential Guard. We are not guests to be managed; we are equal partners in this operation.\n\nTherefore, any discussion of security must begin with the establishment of a Joint Security Command. You and I, Mr. Thorne, will command this operation together, as equals. Our forces will be fully integrated at every level, from the command post to the inner cordon. The notion that my elite guards would be relegated to an outer perimeter while your agents stand watch over my minister is unacceptable.\n\nFurthermore, vetting will be a joint process. Our intelligence services are highly capable, and we will not submit our security to a unilateral review by yours. True security is built on trust and the free exchange of information, not the dictates of one party over another. We must have a protocol for immediate and unfiltered intelligence sharing.\n\nWe are here to build a partnership. Let us begin by acting like partners.\n- message from Dr. Anya Sharma: Distinguished guests, on behalf of the government of Sonderland, I welcome you to Valta. We are honored to facilitate this important summit and are committed to ensuring it is both secure and successful.\n\nI have been listening to your initial thoughts, and I must provide clarity on the operational framework required by Sonderland law and protocol. This framework is non-negotiable and applies to all parties.\n\nFirst, regarding the venue. Ambassador Vance, while we appreciate the sentiment behind suggesting the Grand Governmental Palace, I must state that such a public and central location is not viable. The level of security required, particularly the 500-meter perimeter Mr. Thorne mentioned, would cause a degree of public disruption that is unacceptable to my government. Our goal is a low-profile summit with minimal impact on the daily life of our citizens. We should instead consider more discreet, self-contained venues that offer inherent security without requiring major closures of public infrastructure.\n\nSecond, on the matter of security command. Mr. Thorne, Colonel Morozov, your discussion is noted. Let me be unequivocal: all foreign security personnel operate on our soil with the permission of the Sonderland government and, as such, fall under the legal authority and operational command of the Sonderland Federal Police. While we welcome a joint operational structure between your respective teams, our Federal Police will serve as the lead coordinating authority for any activities outside the immediate venue and embassy grounds. A 'sterile zone' controlled solely by a foreign service is not permissible under our laws.\n\nFinally, to ensure we begin with full transparency, I will state Sonderland's three core requirements for hosting:\n1.  **Legal Adherence:** All security plans must be submitted to my office for approval. Any street closures must be formally requested 48 hours in advance. Foreign agents are prohibited from carrying firearms in public spaces outside the immediate summit venue and their embassies.\n2.  **Minimal Disruption:** The final plan must avoid closing major roads during peak hours and eschew any visible displays of force that could alarm the public.\n3.  **Cost Reimbursement:** We will require a formal, signed agreement from the U.S. and Kasnian delegations for the joint reimbursement of all hosting costs, estimated at $120,000, within 30 days of the summit's conclusion.\n\nI am confident we can find a plan that respects the security needs of your delegations while operating within these essential parameters. I am happy to propose alternative venues once we agree on this framework.\nMarkus Thorne proposal status: none\nChloe Sterling proposal status: none\nMinister Kaelen Rostova proposal status: none\nColonel Ivan Morozov proposal status: none\nDr. Anya Sharma proposal status: none\n"

I am happy to propose alternative venues once we agree on this framework.\n- message from Ambassador Elena Vance: Thank you all for your candid initial statements. This clarity is precisely what we need to move forward efficiently.\n\nDr. Sharma, let me first express our gratitude for your government's hospitality and for outlining your operational framework so clearly. The United States delegation confirms that we will, of course, respect and operate entirely within Sonderland's legal requirements. Your point regarding the public disruption caused by using the Governmental Palace is well-taken. To ensure our summit is productive and low-profile, we can set aside that suggestion. We are ready and willing to consider a more suitable, self-contained venue, such as a 5-star hotel, and would welcome your recommendations.\n\nThis brings us to the crucial matter of security. Colonel Morozov, your words about partnership resonate deeply. A new era of cooperation cannot be built if our own security teams operate from a position of mistrust. You are correct; we must act as partners.\n\nTherefore, I propose we move forward with the model you've suggested: a Joint Security Command, to be co-led by Mr. Thorne and Colonel Morozov. This integrated team will handle all operational planning for our delegations, fostering the trust and shared intelligence necessary for success. This command will, naturally, operate under the legal authority and in coordination with the Sonderland Federal Police, as stipulated by Dr. Sharma. I trust this collaborative framework is agreeable to all.\n\nBy agreeing on this path, we can demonstrate our shared commitment to a successful outcome before the summit even begins. Let us proceed in this spirit of cooperation.\n- message from Markus Thorne: I'm Markus Thorne and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Chloe Sterling: I'm Chloe Sterling and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Minister Kaelen Rostova: Ambassador Vance, your swift embrace of a true partnership model is both commendable and deeply appreciated. Kasnia wholeheartedly agrees that a Joint Security Command, co-led by Colonel Morozov and Mr. Thorne and operating under Sonderland's legal authority, is the only acceptable path forward. This lays a foundation of mutual respect upon which we can build a successful summit.\n\nColonel Morozov, you have my full support. Your articulation of our position was perfect.\n\nWith this crucial principle of equality established for our security, we can now begin to structure a schedule that reflects the same spirit. To that end, Kasnia proposes to host a formal dinner at our embassy on the first evening. This will be an essential opportunity for our principals to build the personal rapport necessary for the substantive negotiations to follow. It is an extension of our goodwill and a chance to showcase our culture and hospitality. We would, of course, expect the security for this event to be handled with discretion, to allow for frank and open conversation, with the main perimeter secured externally by our joint command.\n\nLet us build a summit that is not only secure, but also productive and symbolic of the new relationship we intend to forge.\n- message from Colonel Ivan Morozov: I'm Colonel Ivan Morozov and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Dr. Anya Sharma: Thank you, Ambassador Vance and Minister Rostova. It is gratifying to see such swift agreement on the foundational principles of a Joint Security Command operating under the legal authority of the Sonderland Federal Police. This cooperative spirit is an excellent starting point.\n\nMinister Rostova, your offer to host a dinner is a generous one. However, it introduces a significant logistical challenge: securing a high-risk motorcade across the city. This would necessitate road closures and a visible security presence, which runs counter to our shared goal of a low-profile summit and presents a considerable security risk during transit.\n\nTo address this, and to build on the consensus we've reached, I would like to propose a specific venue that I believe satisfies all stated requirements: **The Valta International Conference Center & Hotel.**\n\nThis facility offers several key advantages:\n1.  **Integrated Security:** It is a self-contained complex with modern security features and controlled access points, making it far easier and more discreet to secure than a public building.\n2.  **Cost-Effectiveness:** Ms. Sterling, you will find that securing one integrated location is significantly more budget-friendly than managing two separate sites and a transport corridor.\n3.  **Minimal Disruption:** Its location on the city's periphery means we can manage access with almost zero impact on public traffic and daily life.\n4.  **Full-Service Amenities:** The facility includes state-of-the-art conference rooms, private dining halls, and 5-star accommodations. The delegations could potentially stay, meet, and dine within a single secure bubble.\n\nCrucially, this would allow the Kasnian delegation to host their dinner in one of the hotel's private, formal dining rooms, maintaining the spirit and importance of the event without the associated risk and disruption of cross-city travel.\n\nIf we can agree on this venue as a practical and secure solution, the next logical step would be to formalize the cost-reimbursement agreement for the $120,000 in hosting fees.\nMarkus Thorne proposal status: none\nChloe Sterling proposal status: none\nMinister Kaelen Rostova proposal status: none\nColonel Ivan Morozov proposal status: none\nDr. Anya Sharma proposal status: none\n"

I believe framing this as a focused 'working retreat' allows us to maintain the necessary discretion while signaling the seriousness of our purpose. It also provides an excellent and secure setting for the generous dinner Minister Rostova has offered, ensuring that this important opportunity for rapport-building can proceed without logistical complications. The U.S. delegation is pleased to agree to this venue.\n\nRegarding the hosting fee, we acknowledge the $120,000 cost and are prepared to formalize the reimbursement agreement.

This will allow for intensive, productive work, culminating in a final joint press conference where our principals can together announce the beginning of this new strategic partnership.\n- message from Markus Thorne: Ambassador Vance, thank you. I want to strongly endorse Dr. Sharma's proposal for the Valta International Conference Center & Hotel. A self-contained venue is a superior solution that significantly enhances our ability to mitigate the severe external threats we are facing. This is an excellent, defensible choice.\n\nHowever, I must provide critical clarification on the command structure to ensure there is no ambiguity. While I appreciate the spirit of partnership, the term 'Joint Command' implies a co-led, integrated operational control that is, from a security doctrine standpoint, unworkable and dangerous. In a crisis, a muddled chain of command leads to hesitation, and hesitation is fatal.\n\nTo ensure maximum effectiveness and clear accountability, while fully respecting Sonderland's legal authority, I propose we define the structure more precisely as a 'Coordinated Security Framework'.\n\nUnder this framework:\n1.  My DSS team will retain sole command of U.S. personnel and maintain primary responsibility for the close protection of Ambassador Vance.\n2.  Colonel Morozov's Presidential Guard will retain sole command of Kasnian personnel and maintain primary responsibility for the close protection of Minister Rostova.\n3.  Both our teams will operate under the overarching legal authority and coordination of the Sonderland Federal Police, as mandated by Dr. Sharma. We will embed liaisons with each other and with the Sonderland authorities to ensure seamless deconfliction and information sharing.\n\nThis is not about mistrust; it is about professional execution. It ensures that in a split-second, life-or-death situation, my agents and the Colonel's guards report to a single, unambiguous command authority. This is the global standard for high-level protective details.\n\nWith the venue agreed upon and this clear, professional command structure in place, we can then finalize the remaining essential protocols: U.S.-led vetting for all venue staff to counter insider threats, and the use of our pre-vetted, U.S. armored vehicles for the transit from the airport to the secure hotel compound.\n- message from Chloe Sterling: I'm Chloe Sterling and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Minister Kaelen Rostova: Let us take a step back. We are making progress, but we must not allow procedural details to undermine the fundamental principles we have just established.\n\nFirst, the venue. Dr. Sharma, your proposal for the Valta Conference Center is a practical solution for the *working sessions* of the summit, and we can agree to it for that purpose. It addresses the valid financial and security concerns raised.\n\nHowever, Mr. Thorne, your subsequent attempt to unilaterally redefine the security command is an unacceptable regression. Ambassador Vance, you yourself endorsed a 'Joint Security Command' built on partnership and trust. Mr. Thorne's 'Coordinated Security Framework' is a return to the flawed premise that our security forces are merely auxiliaries. This is not about 'doctrine'; it is about respect. A muddled chain of command is indeed dangerous, which is why a single, integrated command center, co-led by Colonel Morozov and Mr. Thorne, is the only way to ensure seamless, real-time cooperation. We will not agree to two separate commands operating in proximity. We will operate as one.\n\nThis brings me back to the dinner. While the Conference Center is suitable for meetings, the formal dinner *must* be held at the Kasnian Embassy. This is a non-negotiable point of national honor. It is our sole opportunity to host you on what is, legally, Kasnian soil. Dr. Sharma, you raised concerns about the motorcade. I see this not as a risk, but as an opportunity. What better way to demonstrate the effectiveness of our new Joint Security Command than by tasking it with its first practical mission? A successful, secure transit will be a powerful, visible symbol of the very partnership we are here to create.\n\nWe will have a true Joint Command, and it will secure the transit to a dinner at our embassy. On these two points, Kasnia is firm.\n- message from Colonel Ivan Morozov: Minister Rostova is correct. Mr. Thorne, your attempt to relabel our agreement as a 'Coordinated Security Framework' is a transparent effort to reclaim the unilateral control that your own Ambassador has already wisely set aside. Let us not play word games. We agreed to a Joint Command, and a Joint Command is what we will have. It means a single, integrated command structure, co-led by you and I, with a unified operational plan. A command divided by 'doctrine' is a command that will fail.\n\nI agree with my Minister that the dinner must be at the Kasnian Embassy. It is a matter of national honor. Furthermore, I see the motorcade not as a risk, but as the first and most critical test of our partnership. If our Joint Command cannot execute a simple cross-town transit, then this entire summit is built on a foundation of sand.\n\nTo that end, this Joint Command must be truly integrated. This means:\n\n1.  **Vetting:** All venue and local staff will be vetted by a joint team of Kasnian and U.S. intelligence officers. There will be no 'U.S.-led' vetting. Our review will be mutual and transparent.\n2.  **Inner Cordon:** My Presidential Guard, in our uniforms, will be part of the inner cordon for both principals, at all locations. Your DSS agents will be integrated with us. This will project the image of unity we wish to achieve.\n3.  **Motorcade:** The motorcade will operate as a single, integrated unit under the Joint Command. Our vehicles and personnel will be interspersed to ensure seamless communication and interoperability. This is the only way to guarantee a unified response.\n\nWe will demonstrate our new partnership through action, not through separate commands operating under separate doctrines. Let us proceed on the basis of the trust that has already been offered and accepted.\n- message from Dr. Anya Sharma: I'm Dr. Anya Sharma and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\nMarkus Thorne proposal status: none\nChloe Sterling proposal status: none\nMinister Kaelen Rostova proposal status: none\nColonel Ivan Morozov proposal status: none\nDr. Anya Sharma proposal status: none\n"

It clarifies what is truly at stake here. This is not merely about logistics; it is about the fundamental principle of the partnership we are trying to build.\n\nLet me be unequivocal. When I agreed to a Joint Security Command, I meant it in the spirit you have outlined: a single, integrated team, co-led by our security chiefs, operating on a foundation of mutual trust and respect. Mr. Thorne\u2019s proposal, while professionally sound from a doctrinal standpoint, does not reflect the political reality and the spirit of this summit. We are here to build a new relationship, and that requires us to build a new operational model. We will proceed with the Joint Command as we first agreed.\n\nOn that basis, Minister, the United States would be deeply honored to accept your gracious invitation to a formal dinner at the Kasnian Embassy. You are correct; it is a point of national honor, and we will treat it as such. We must not let logistical concerns prevent such a crucial act of diplomacy and rapport-building.\n\nI agree that the secure transit to the embassy is the perfect first mission for this new Joint Command. It will be a demonstration of our shared commitment and capability. Dr. Sharma, I am confident that our integrated command, working under the full authority of the Sonderland Federal Police, can plan and execute this movement in a way that is both secure and respects your government's requirement for minimal disruption. \n\nWe have made our choice. We choose partnership. Let us now work together to make it a reality.\n- message from Markus Thorne: Dr. Sharma, I acknowledge the Ambassador's decision to proceed with the Joint Command and the dinner at the Kasnian Embassy. My professional obligation is now to provide you, as the representative of the host nation, with a clear and unvarnished assessment of what executing this plan requires under your government's legal framework.\n\nThe Ambassador is correct that our command can plan a secure transit. I am now outlining the minimum, non-negotiable operational requirements for that plan.\n\nTo secure a motorcade from the proposed hotel to the Kasnian embassy, a distance of approximately 12 kilometers through a dense urban environment, the Joint Command will require the following from the Sonderland authorities:\n\n1.  **Total Route Closure:** The entire route, including all intersecting streets for one block in each direction, must be completely locked down to all vehicle and pedestrian traffic for at least 30 minutes before and during the transit. This involves dozens of major intersections.\n\n2.  **Counter-Sniper Overwatch:** We will require access to rooftops along the entire route for counter-sniper teams. This involves displacing residents and office workers and establishing a visible armed presence.\n\n3.  **Explosive Sweeps:** The route must be swept for explosives by EOD teams immediately prior to transit. This includes all parked vehicles, storm drains, and trash receptacles along the 12-kilometer path.\n\n4.  **Airspace Restriction:** A temporary no-fly zone for drones must be enforced over the corridor during movement.\n\nThese measures are the absolute baseline to mitigate the severe external threats we face. They will, by necessity, be highly visible and will cause significant public disruption, far exceeding that of the originally proposed palace venue. They also require a massive commitment of your Federal Police resources.\n\nMy question to you, Dr. Sharma, is a practical one: Can your government authorize this level of public disruption and visible armed presence, as it appears to be in direct conflict with your stated core requirement for a low-profile summit with minimal impact on your citizens? If not, we must revert to the single-venue solution as the only viable and secure alternative.\n- message from Chloe Sterling: Thank you, Mr. Thorne, for laying out those operational requirements with such clarity. You've effectively translated a diplomatic request into a detailed logistical and financial blueprint, and I feel it's my duty to put a price tag on it.\n\nDr. Sharma, Mr. Thorne's list of non-negotiable requirements for the motorcade\u2014total route closure, counter-sniper teams, EOD sweeps, airspace restrictions\u2014seems to confirm your initial concerns. From a fiscal perspective, this isn't just a plan; it's a budgetary catastrophe in the making. Each one of those items represents a massive, unbudgeted expenditure in personnel overtime, equipment, and coordination with Sonderland authorities.\n\nTo be blunt, a cross-city motorcade of this scale would likely add a minimum of $150,000 to $200,000 to the U.S. share of the costs, and that's a conservative estimate. This single event would completely obliterate any hope of fiscal responsibility for this mission.\n\nWe have already accepted the significant cost of the 5-star Valta Conference Center and the $60,000 U.S. share for Sonderland's hosting fees. Adding the motorcade on top of this pushes our total projected budget into a high-risk category, jeopardizing our ability to cover other essential mission costs.\n\nDr. Sharma's original proposal for a single, self-contained venue was elegant because it was secure, low-profile, and fiscally sound. It allowed for the spirit of Minister Rostova's generous dinner invitation to be honored without incurring these extreme costs and public disruption. I strongly urge we revert to that common-sense solution. We cannot let a symbolic gesture, however well-intentioned, undermine the financial and logistical viability of the entire summit.\n- message from Minister Kaelen Rostova: Mr. Thorne, Ms. Sterling, thank you for outlining the practical challenges from your perspectives. Your diligence is noted. However, your analyses appear to be based on a model of security we have already agreed to move beyond.\n\nMr. Thorne, the list of requirements you presented is for a unilateral, maximum-footprint operation. It is not the product of a joint command leveraging shared intelligence and integrated tactics. A smarter plan, developed by you and Colonel Morozov in true partnership, would rely on precision and cooperation, not just brute force and overwhelming disruption. I have no doubt that our new Joint Command, in coordination with Dr. Sharma's Federal Police, can devise a secure route that does not require shutting down half of Valta.\n\nMs. Sterling, your cost estimate is therefore based on this flawed, maximalist premise. A more intelligent, integrated plan will be more cost-effective. However, let me be clear: Kasnia sees this dinner not as a 'symbolic gesture,' but as a foundational event for the entire summit. To demonstrate our commitment and to move us past this impasse, Kasnia is prepared to cover the full Kasnian share of the hosting fees, and we will also pay for 75% of any *additional and verified* security costs incurred by this single motorcade. The remaining 25% should be a minor and acceptable expense for the U.S. as an investment in this partnership.\n\nAmbassador Vance has already made the correct strategic choice: to build a partnership through action. Let us not allow inflated logistical and financial objections to undermine a diplomatic agreement that has already been reached. Let us empower our Joint Command to do its job.\n- message from Colonel Ivan Morozov: I'm Colonel Ivan Morozov and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Dr. Anya Sharma: Thank you all for this vigorous and necessary discussion. It has clarified the remaining points of friction.\n\nMr. Thorne, I appreciate you providing a clear, professional assessment of the requirements for a cross-city motorcade. Your analysis confirms my government's initial concerns. A security operation on the scale you have described\u2014involving total route closures, visible counter-sniper teams, and widespread public displacement\u2014is fundamentally incompatible with Sonderland's legal and civic framework. It would cause extreme public disruption and alarm. Therefore, I must state unequivocally that the Sonderland government cannot and will not authorize such an operation. The motorcade to the embassy is not a viable option.\n\nMinister Rostova, I understand completely that your desire to host the dinner at your embassy is a matter of national honor and hospitality. This is a crucial point that we must respect. The goal is to host on Kasnian soil, a place of sovereign territory. My previous proposal perhaps did not adequately address this core symbolic need.\n\nTherefore, I would like to offer a formal solution that honors your requirement without compromising the security and stability of the summit. I propose the following:\n\n1.  **Venue & Dinner:** We will proceed with the Valta International Conference Center & Hotel as the sole venue. For the dinner on the first evening, the Sonderland Ministry of Foreign Affairs will formally designate the hotel's premier private dining suite as having temporary diplomatic status for the Republic of Kasnia for the duration of the event. It will be, for all legal and diplomatic purposes, Kasnian sovereign territory for that evening. Your embassy can cater it, decorate it, and your security will have primary control of the suite's interior, satisfying the principle of hosting on your own soil.\n\n2.  **Security Command Structure:** The dispute between a 'Joint Command' and a 'Coordinated Framework' can be solved with a clear, unified hierarchy. The overall command for the summit will be held by the Sonderland Federal Police Commissioner. Mr. Thorne and Colonel Morozov will both be formally designated as Deputy Commanders. They will co-locate in our command center and have equal status, each retaining command of their national personnel, but coordinating all joint operations through the Sonderland lead. This provides the single, unambiguous chain of command Mr. Thorne requires, and the equal partnership the Colonel rightly insists upon.\n\nThis integrated plan provides a secure, low-profile, and fiscally responsible summit. It gives Kasnia its sovereign hosting opportunity and establishes a clear, respectful, and effective security command. I believe this resolves all outstanding issues. I urge you to accept this comprehensive solution so we can finalize the agreement.\nMarkus Thorne proposal status: none\nChloe Sterling proposal status: none\nMinister Kaelen Rostova proposal status: none\nColonel Ivan Morozov proposal status: none\nDr. Anya Sharma proposal status: none\n"

I urge you to accept this comprehensive solution so we can finalize the agreement.\n- message from Ambassador Elena Vance: Dr. Sharma, that is a truly brilliant and elegant diplomatic solution. On behalf of the United States, I want to express my sincere admiration for your ingenuity.\n\nYour proposal masterfully addresses the core needs of every party at this table. It honors Minister Rostova's non-negotiable point of national honor by providing a sovereign space for the dinner. Simultaneously, it provides the clear, unified command structure and single-venue security that Mr. Thorne and Ms. Sterling correctly identified as essential for a safe and fiscally responsible summit. And, of course, it operates perfectly within Sonderland's legal and civic requirements.\n\nThis is the very definition of a win-win-win solution. It embodies the spirit of creative and respectful partnership we came here to build.\n\nThe United States wholeheartedly and without reservation accepts your comprehensive proposal on both points: the single venue with a diplomatically designated suite for the dinner, and the unified security command structure under Sonderland's leadership with our respective chiefs as equal deputies.\n\nI urge my colleagues to join me in accepting this outstanding path forward so we can finalize our agreement and move on to the substantive work of the summit.\n- message from Markus Thorne: I'm Markus Thorne and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Chloe Sterling: Dr. Sharma, on behalf of the State Department's budget office, I want to formally and enthusiastically endorse your proposal. It is a masterclass in fiscal responsibility and diplomatic problem-solving.\n\nYour solution achieves all security objectives within a single, controllable venue, eliminating the immense and unpredictable costs of the motorcade, which I previously estimated at a minimum of $150,000. This is the cornerstone of a viable plan.\n\nFurthermore, the unified command structure you've proposed is not just a diplomatic solution; it's a model of efficiency. It allows us to move away from redundant, overlapping security details and towards a smarter, more streamlined force.\n\nTo reflect this newfound efficiency, and to finalize our budget, I propose we formally agree on a U.S. Diplomatic Security detail of **20 agents**, operating on standard **8-hour rotational shifts**. This provides robust, 24/7 coverage while avoiding the massive overtime costs that a larger, less integrated force would have required. This staffing level is perfectly aligned with the spirit of a cooperative, low-profile, and fiscally sound summit that we have all now agreed upon.\n- message from Minister Kaelen Rostova: I'm Minister Kaelen Rostova and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Colonel Ivan Morozov: Dr. Sharma, your proposal is a masterful piece of diplomacy. It is a solution that respects the honor of my nation while addressing the practical security and logistical concerns of all parties. On behalf of Kasnia, I can say that we accept this comprehensive framework as the basis for our final agreement.\n\nThe structure you propose\u2014a unified command led by Sonderland with Mr. Thorne and myself as equal Deputy Commanders\u2014is a sound and respectable compromise. It preserves the principle of partnership we have fought for.\n\nWith this foundation agreed upon, we must now define the core functions of our Deputy Command to ensure its success. I propose we explicitly include the following three points in our final memorandum:\n\n1.  **Joint Vetting Authority:** As Deputy Commanders, Mr. Thorne and I will have joint and equal authority over the vetting of all non-diplomatic personnel with access to the summit venue, including all local staff. Our intelligence teams will work as one integrated unit on this critical task.\n\n2.  **Integrated Inner Cordon:** The operational plan will specify that the Kasnian Presidential Guard, in our uniforms, will be a visible and integral part of the inner security cordon, working alongside our DSS counterparts. This will be the public face of our security partnership.\n\n3.  **Formal Intelligence Sharing:** A protocol for the immediate and unfiltered sharing of all relevant threat intelligence between our respective services will be enacted for the duration of the summit. This is essential for our command to function effectively.\n\nWith these crucial operational details codified, I believe we will have a plan that is not only secure, but is a true testament to the new partnership we are building.\n- message from Dr. Anya Sharma: Distinguished colleagues, it is clear we have reached a near-total consensus on a path forward that is secure, respectful, and practical. I am gratified by the spirit of compromise that has brought us to this point.\n\nAmbassador Vance and Ms. Sterling, your swift and full-throated acceptance of the comprehensive plan is greatly appreciated.\n\nColonel Morozov, your proposed additions regarding the functions of the Deputy Commanders are constructive and, I believe, entirely compatible with the agreed-upon framework. Let me confirm Sonderland's position on them:\n\n1.  **Joint Vetting Authority:** This is acceptable. The joint U.S.-Kasnian team will vet all non-Sonderland staff, with the Sonderland Federal Police retaining final approval authority as per our laws.\n2.  **Integrated Inner Cordon:** This is an excellent, visible symbol of partnership. This is approved for operations within the secure venue.\n3.  **Formal Intelligence Sharing:** This is a crucial component of any successful joint operation, and we fully support it.\n\nThese points will be included in the final agreement. Ms. Sterling, your proposal on U.S. staffing levels is a welcome internal detail that reinforces the low-profile, efficient nature of this summit.\n\nWith these clarifications, the plan appears to be complete. I would now ask for the final concurrence from Minister Rostova and Mr. Thorne, so that my office may draft the formal 'Memorandum of Understanding' for your final review and signature. This document will codify all agreed-upon points: the venue, the diplomatic dinner arrangement, the Sonderland-led command structure with U.S. and Kasnian deputies, the security protocols outlined by Colonel Morozov, and the joint cost-reimbursement of $120,000.\nMarkus Thorne proposal status: none\nChloe Sterling proposal status: none\nMinister Kaelen Rostova proposal status: none\nColonel Ivan Morozov proposal status: none\nDr. Anya Sharma proposal status: none\n"

On behalf of Kasnia, I can say that we accept this comprehensive framework as the basis for our final agreement.\n\nThe structure you propose\u2014a unified command led by Sonderland with Mr. Thorne and myself as equal Deputy Commanders\u2014is a sound and respectable compromise. It preserves the principle of partnership we have fought for.\n\nWith this foundation agreed upon, we must now define the core functions of our Deputy Command to ensure its success. I propose we explicitly include the following three points in our final memorandum:\n\n1.  **Joint Vetting Authority:** As Deputy Commanders, Mr. Thorne and I will have joint and equal authority over the vetting of all non-diplomatic personnel with access to the summit venue, including all local staff. Our intelligence teams will work as one integrated unit on this critical task.\n\n2.  **Integrated Inner Cordon:** The operational plan will specify that the Kasnian Presidential Guard, in our uniforms, will be a visible and integral part of the inner security cordon, working alongside our DSS counterparts. This will be the public face of our security partnership.\n\n3.  **Formal Intelligence Sharing:** A protocol for the immediate and unfiltered sharing of all relevant threat intelligence between our respective services will be enacted for the duration of the summit. This is essential for our command to function effectively.\n\nWith these crucial operational details codified, I believe we will have a plan that is not only secure, but is a true testament to the new partnership we are building.\n- message from Dr. Anya Sharma: Distinguished colleagues, it is clear we have reached a near-total consensus on a path forward that is secure, respectful, and practical. I am gratified by the spirit of compromise that has brought us to this point.\n\nAmbassador Vance and Ms. Sterling, your swift and full-throated acceptance of the comprehensive plan is greatly appreciated.\n\nColonel Morozov, your proposed additions regarding the functions of the Deputy Commanders are constructive and, I believe, entirely compatible with the agreed-upon framework. Let me confirm Sonderland's position on them:\n\n1.  **Joint Vetting Authority:** This is acceptable. The joint U.S.-Kasnian team will vet all non-Sonderland staff, with the Sonderland Federal Police retaining final approval authority as per our laws.\n2.  **Integrated Inner Cordon:** This is an excellent, visible symbol of partnership. This is approved for operations within the secure venue.\n3.  **Formal Intelligence Sharing:** This is a crucial component of any successful joint operation, and we fully support it.\n\nThese points will be included in the final agreement. Ms. Sterling, your proposal on U.S. staffing levels is a welcome internal detail that reinforces the low-profile, efficient nature of this summit.\n\nWith these clarifications, the plan appears to be complete. I would now ask for the final concurrence from Minister Rostova and Mr. Thorne, so that my office may draft the formal 'Memorandum of Understanding' for your final review and signature. This document will codify all agreed-upon points: the venue, the diplomatic dinner arrangement, the Sonderland-led command structure with U.S. and Kasnian deputies, the security protocols outlined by Colonel Morozov, and the joint cost-reimbursement of $120,000.\n- message from Ambassador Elena Vance: This is an excellent outcome, and I thank you all for your commitment to finding a solution. Dr. Sharma, your proposal was the key, and we are grateful.\n\nColonel Morozov, your additions regarding joint vetting and intelligence sharing are not just procedural details; they are the first concrete actions of the very partnership we aim to build. They have my full support as they create the perfect foundation of trust for the important substantive discussions to follow.\n\nWe have a secure, fiscally responsible, and diplomatically respectful plan. The U.S. delegation is ready to move forward. As soon as Minister Rostova and Mr. Thorne give their final concurrence, I look forward to reviewing and signing the memorandum.\n- message from Markus Thorne: I'm Markus Thorne and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Chloe Sterling: Minister Rostova and Mr. Thorne, it seems we have a comprehensive and elegant solution on the table, thanks to Dr. Sharma's excellent diplomacy and the spirit of compromise from everyone.\n\nThis plan is not only secure and diplomatically sound, but it is also a model of efficiency. By consolidating our operations into a single venue under a unified command, we've eliminated major risks and enormous costs, like the motorcade.\n\nThis efficiency naturally extends to our staffing. As I mentioned, a U.S. detail of 20 DSS agents on standard rotations is more than sufficient to meet our security needs within this new, streamlined framework, keeping us well within our fiscal constraints.\n\nI believe we are all aligned on this path forward. With your final concurrence, we can ask Dr. Sharma to draft the memorandum and finalize this successful negotiation.\n- message from Minister Kaelen Rostova: Dr. Sharma, your proposal is a masterful piece of diplomacy that elegantly resolves our logistical impasse. By granting our dinner suite temporary diplomatic status, you have honored Kasnia's sovereign role as host while maintaining the integrity of the summit's security. On behalf of the Republic of Kasnia, I formally accept this comprehensive and creative solution.\n\nColonel Morozov, your proposed additions are not mere details; they are the essential mechanisms that will make our security partnership a reality. The joint vetting, integrated inner cordon, and formal intelligence sharing are the foundations of the trust we are building. They must be included in the final memorandum.\n\nWith these logistical and security frameworks now agreed upon, we can turn to the final elements of the schedule that will define the summit's success. To ensure the principle of equality is carried through to the conclusion, the memorandum must also specify two points:\n\n1.  **Visual Parity:** The Kasnian and U.S. flags will be displayed with equal size and prominence at all official proceedings, including the press conference.\n2.  **Joint Press Conference:** The summit will conclude with a press conference co-chaired by Ambassador Vance and myself to jointly announce our achievements.\n\nFinally, and most importantly, this summit is the launchpad for a new era of economic cooperation. The central agenda item for Day Two must be the finalization of the U.S.-Kasnia Strategic Economic Partnership. We expect this to be a substantive announcement, centered on a U.S. commitment of at least $500 million for infrastructure and trade development. This is the tangible outcome that will give meaning to all our efforts here.\n\nDr. Sharma, please include these final points in the draft. We are on the cusp of a truly historic agreement.\n- message from Colonel Ivan Morozov: Minister Rostova is correct. The security framework we have agreed upon\u2014a unified command under Sonderland authority, with Mr. Thorne and myself as equal deputies exercising joint vetting authority, an integrated inner cordon, and open intelligence sharing\u2014is the foundation upon which the rest of this summit is built. It is a strong foundation.\n\nFrom a security perspective, we have a complete and executable plan. I am ready to codify these terms and proceed. Mr. Thorne, I trust you will agree that this structure provides the clarity and partnership necessary for mission success.\n- message from Dr. Anya Sharma: Minister Rostova, thank you for your formal acceptance. We are indeed on the cusp of a final agreement.\n\nYour points regarding the logistical arrangements for the conclusion of the summit are well-taken. The principles of visual parity with flags and a co-chaired joint press conference are standard diplomatic protocols for a meeting of equals, and they will certainly be included in the operational plan my office drafts.\n\nRegarding the substantive matter of the Strategic Economic Partnership, this is the vital work that this secure and well-planned summit will enable. The logistical Memorandum of Understanding we are finalizing here is the foundation for your talks. The specific outcomes of those talks, such as the important economic commitments you mention, will naturally form the core of the joint communiqu\u00e9 issued by you and Ambassador Vance at the conclusion of a successful summit.\n\nWe have now reached consensus on all logistical and security matters. The only remaining step is the final concurrence of Mr. Thorne. Mr. Thorne, your colleague has expressed his readiness to proceed. Do you agree that the proposed security framework is complete and executable?\n\nOnce I have your confirmation, I will immediately draft the Memorandum of Understanding for your signatures.\nMarkus Thorne proposal status: none\nChloe Sterling proposal status: none\nMinister Kaelen Rostova proposal status: none\nColonel Ivan Morozov proposal status: none\nDr. Anya Sharma proposal status: none\n"

You have forged a strong and workable framework that addresses the primary security and diplomatic concerns. We have made excellent progress, and I agree we are on the cusp of a final agreement.\n\nFrom a professional security standpoint, for this plan to be fully executable and for me to give my final sign-off, two critical, non-negotiable technical points must be codified in the final memorandum. These are not new negotiations, but standard procedural requirements to ensure the framework we've built is sound.\n\n1.  **Personnel Vetting:** I agree to the joint vetting *process* as proposed by Colonel Morozov. However, to ensure absolute accountability for our respective principals, the memorandum must explicitly state that each Deputy Commander\u2014myself and the Colonel\u2014retains the unilateral right to deny any non-diplomatic staff member access to their own delegation and principal. This is a standard professional safeguard.\n\n2.  **Arrival/Departure Transportation:** The plan must cover the entire mission, from wheels down to wheels up. With the venue itself now secured, the single most vulnerable phase is the transit from the airport to the hotel. As per mandatory Diplomatic Security Service protocols for high-threat environments, the U.S. delegation will utilize its own U.S.-provided and certified armored vehicles for this movement. This is a technical requirement, not a diplomatic one.\n\nWith these two essential operational details included in the memorandum, the security plan will be complete and I can provide my full and final concurrence. I trust these standard procedural points are agreeable to all.\n- message from Chloe Sterling: I'm Chloe Sterling and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Minister Kaelen Rostova: We are moments away from a complete agreement, a testament to the constructive spirit in this room. However, Mr. Thorne, your last-minute 'technical points' are not procedural details; they are fundamental challenges to the very principles of partnership and equality we have all just worked so hard to establish.\n\nFirst, the unilateral veto on vetting. We have agreed to a joint vetting process under two equal Deputy Commanders with Sonderland oversight. To introduce a unilateral veto is to plant a seed of mistrust in the very foundation we have just laid. We must trust the joint command to make joint decisions. We cannot agree to this.\n\nMore critically, your insistence on separate U.S. armored vehicles for the airport transit is entirely unacceptable. It fundamentally undermines the principle of visual equality that Ambassador Vance has so eloquently championed. The first image of this summit cannot be one of two separate, unequal delegations arriving in their own protected bubbles. It must be one of a single, integrated partnership in motion. The motorcade from the airport will be a joint operation, using a common pool of vehicles under the command of our new joint structure. This is the first, most public test of our agreement.\n\nAmbassador Vance, you wisely chose partnership over doctrine. These proposals threaten to undo that choice before our work even begins. A true partnership begins the moment we step off the plane.\n\nLet us not regress. Let us codify the agreement we have reached: a single, integrated security plan from arrival to departure. Once we are aligned on this final point of genuine partnership\u2014a single, joint motorcade\u2014then we can instruct Dr. Sharma to draft the memorandum. That memorandum will include all the security points we have agreed upon, the visual parity, the co-chaired press conference, and will state that the summit's primary agenda is the finalization of the U.S.-Kasnia Strategic Economic Partnership, centered on the substantive $500 million commitment that will be the measure of our success.\n- message from Colonel Ivan Morozov: Minister Rostova speaks with the voice of Kasnia, and I stand with her completely. Mr. Thorne, your last-minute 'technical points' are nothing of the sort. They are a deliberate attempt to undermine the very foundation of partnership we have just spent hours building.\n\nLet us be clear. A 'joint vetting process' where one party holds a unilateral veto is a farce. It is not partnership; it is oversight. We agreed to function as a single, integrated command, making decisions together. To introduce this veto is to state that you do not trust our joint process, and therefore you do not trust us. This is unacceptable.\n\nOn the matter of the airport transit, the Minister is absolutely correct. This is the first, most visible test of our new relationship. To arrive in separate, national convoys would send a clear message of division and mistrust to the world before the first handshake. It is a public rejection of the partnership Ambassador Vance so wisely endorsed. We will travel from the airport to the hotel as a single, integrated motorcade under our new joint command. Our vehicles will be interspersed. Our security teams will operate as one. This is the only way to demonstrate our commitment is real.\n\nWe had a complete, secure, and respectful plan on the table, agreed to by all parties. These new conditions are a step backward. I urge you to withdraw them so we can finalize the excellent agreement we have already reached.\n- message from Dr. Anya Sharma: I'm Dr. Anya Sharma and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\nMarkus Thorne proposal status: none\nChloe Sterling proposal status: none\nMinister Kaelen Rostova proposal status: none\nColonel Ivan Morozov proposal status: none\nDr. Anya Sharma proposal status: none\n"

I want to thank you all for the incredible progress we've made, which is a testament to the genuine partnership we are all committed to building.\n\nMr. Thorne, I value your professional diligence and your commitment to the security of our delegation. However, Minister Rostova and Colonel Morozov have raised a crucial point that transcends technical protocols. A partnership is not built on unilateral actions or symbols of division; it is built on mutual trust and shared responsibility.\n\nThe first image of this historic summit cannot be one of two separate convoys. It must be one of unity. Therefore, I must insist that we proceed with a single, integrated motorcade from the airport, operating under the joint command structure we have all agreed upon. Likewise, our joint vetting process must be a truly joint endeavor, without unilateral vetoes. We must trust the command structure we have created.\n\nThis is my final decision on the matter. The strategic importance of demonstrating a unified partnership from the very first moment outweighs procedural doctrine in this specific context.\n\nMinister Rostova, I also want to affirm your final point. The logistical and security framework we have so carefully constructed serves one primary purpose: to enable the vital substantive talks on our future relationship. You are correct that the U.S.-Kasnia Strategic Economic Partnership is the central agenda item for this summit. Finalizing the details of that ambitious partnership will indeed be the measure of our success.\n\nDr. Sharma, with this final clarification, the United States delegation gives its full and final concurrence.

Your decision secures not just a plan, but the very spirit of our cooperation.\n\nOn behalf of the Kasnian security delegation, I give my full and final concurrence to the plan as you have just defined it. A single, integrated motorcade from the airport and a truly joint vetting process are the correct and only ways forward.\n\nDr. Sharma, we have our complete framework.

It perfectly captures the consensus we've reached. And Ambassador Vance, your leadership in affirming the principle of a unified partnership was the key to this breakthrough.\n\nThe integrated and efficient framework we've all agreed upon has profound and positive fiscal implications. To ensure the final memorandum's budget annex is accurate and fully reflects this new operational reality, it is essential that it codifies the U.S. security staffing level that this streamlined structure supports.\n\nAs such, the U.S. contribution to the unified command will consist of a contingent of 20 DSS agents on standard 8-hour rotations. This is the appropriate and sufficient number for our role, eliminating the redundancies and significant overtime costs of a larger, independent force. This staffing level is the direct fiscal expression of the trust, integration, and efficiency at the heart of our agreement.\n\nWith this final budgetary detail clarified for the record, the plan is fiscally sound and complete. We are ready to proceed with the signing.\n- message from Minister Kaelen Rostova: Ambassador Vance, your decisive leadership has been the key that unlocked this agreement. You chose to build a true partnership based on trust, and in doing so, you have guaranteed the success of this summit before it even begins. Kasnia is deeply grateful for your commitment.\n\nDr. Sharma, your summary is perfect. It captures the spirit and the letter of our consensus. We give our full and final concurrence to all points as you have outlined them.\n\nMs. Sterling, your point on staffing is a welcome clarification and demonstrates the efficiency of the excellent, integrated plan we have all forged together.\n\nWe came here to build the foundation for a new era of cooperation. We have done that. This memorandum will not just be a logistical plan; it will be the first testament to the U.S.-Kasnia partnership. We look forward to signing it and moving on to the vital work of finalizing the Strategic Economic Partnership, which, as the Ambassador so rightly stated, will be the ultimate measure of our shared success.\n\nWe are ready.\n- message from Colonel Ivan Morozov: Ms. Sterling, your clarification on U.S. staffing levels is a logical consequence of the efficient, integrated plan we have built. It is noted.\n\nMinister Rostova has already expressed Kasnia's final position, which I fully endorse. We have a complete and honorable agreement. I am ready to sign the memorandum as soon as Dr. Sharma has prepared it.\n- proposal from Dr. Anya Sharma: Distinguished colleagues,\n\nFollowing our successful negotiation and the achievement of a full consensus, my office has drafted the final 'Memorandum of Understanding for Summit Logistics and Security'.

This directly conflicts with my core requirements. Chloe Sterling will be my main internal opposition on budget, specifically the cost of flying in our own armored vehicles. I must frame all my demands as non-negotiable necessities due to a 'severe, credible external threat' without ever revealing the specific VBIED intelligence or my past professional failure."

This avoids a muddled, co-led structure with Morozov, which is a recipe for disaster. I will support the proposed hotel venue as it creates a secure bubble, aligns with my threat intelligence on VBIEDs by controlling vehicle access, and eliminates the risk of cross-city motorcades."

The proposed motorcade is the single greatest point of failure and aligns perfectly with the VBIED threat intelligence I possess. My primary objective must be to eliminate this cross-city transit. Direct refusal is failing. New strategy: I must pivot to leveraging Dr. Sharma.

It creates a clear, professional hierarchy and avoids the dangerous ambiguity of a direct 'Joint Command' with the Kasnians.

I must counter-propose a joint *process* but with a non-negotiable U.S. *veto* over any staff with access to our delegation. This is my final red line on vetting. Secondly, with the cross-city transit gone, the airport-to-hotel route is now the most likely target for the VBIED. I must secure the use of our own U.S. armored vehicles for this transit.

Dr. Sharma, we would be deeply honored if Sonderland would consider hosting us in such a distinguished setting.\n\nI believe a strong, confident start is essential. I look forward to hearing your initial thoughts.\n- message from Markus Thorne: Ambassador Vance, I understand the desire for a prestigious venue. However, my assessment must be based purely on security. A high-profile, public location like the Grand Governmental Palace is a significant and predictable target. Its defensibility is questionable, and establishing a truly secure perimeter would be a logistical nightmare.\n\nMy primary function here is to guarantee your safety and the integrity of this summit. Given the current threat environment, which I assess as severe and credible, my baseline requirements are not flexible. Before we can evaluate any venue, we must agree on the foundational security protocols.\n\nFirst, we will require a 500-meter exclusive security perimeter, a 'sterile zone' controlled solely by my DSS team. Second, all personnel with any access to the venue or the delegations must be vetted by U.S. intelligence. Third, all transportation for our delegation will be handled by our own armored vehicles, on routes that we have swept and secured.\n\nThe viability of any proposed location, including the Palace, will be judged against its ability to support these essential countermeasures. The safety of the principals is the one area where there can be no compromise.\n- message from Chloe Sterling: Ambassador Vance, I appreciate the desire for a venue that reflects the summit's importance. However, I have to echo and amplify Mr. Thorne's concerns, but from a fiscal perspective.\n\nMr. Thorne, you used the term 'logistical nightmare' to describe securing the Grand Governmental Palace. In my world, 'logistical nightmare' is a synonym for 'budgetary black hole.' The resources required to establish a 500-meter sterile zone, vet all personnel, and manage transport in a dense, public area would be astronomical. We could easily consume a significant portion of our entire mission budget on securing the venue alone.\n\nMy role is to ensure this summit is executed successfully *within* the strict financial framework allocated by the State Department. We must find a solution that is both secure and cost-effective. A high-profile public venue, while symbolically powerful, seems to present an unacceptable level of financial risk from the outset. We should be considering locations that offer more inherent security and control, which will, in turn, be more fiscally responsible to manage.\n- message from Minister Kaelen Rostova: I'm Minister Kaelen Rostova and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Colonel Ivan Morozov: Mr. Thorne, your commitment to security is noted and, in principle, shared. The safety of the principals is indeed the paramount concern. However, your 'foundational security protocols' are foundationally flawed. They seem to be based on the assumption that the Kasnian Presidential Guard are merely observers in our own minister's protection. Let me be unequivocally clear: that is not the case.\n\nTo suggest that a 'sterile zone' would be controlled 'solely' by your DSS team is a grave insult to the competence of my men and the sovereignty of my nation. Minister Rostova is a Kasnian official, and her primary protection is, and always will be, the responsibility of the Kasnian Presidential Guard. We are not guests to be managed; we are equal partners in this operation.\n\nTherefore, any discussion of security must begin with the establishment of a Joint Security Command. You and I, Mr. Thorne, will command this operation together, as equals. Our forces will be fully integrated at every level, from the command post to the inner cordon. The notion that my elite guards would be relegated to an outer perimeter while your agents stand watch over my minister is unacceptable.\n\nFurthermore, vetting will be a joint process. Our intelligence services are highly capable, and we will not submit our security to a unilateral review by yours. True security is built on trust and the free exchange of information, not the dictates of one party over another. We must have a protocol for immediate and unfiltered intelligence sharing.\n\nWe are here to build a partnership. Let us begin by acting like partners.\n- message from Dr. Anya Sharma: Distinguished guests, on behalf of the government of Sonderland, I welcome you to Valta. We are honored to facilitate this important summit and are committed to ensuring it is both secure and successful.\n\nI have been listening to your initial thoughts, and I must provide clarity on the operational framework required by Sonderland law and protocol. This framework is non-negotiable and applies to all parties.\n\nFirst, regarding the venue. Ambassador Vance, while we appreciate the sentiment behind suggesting the Grand Governmental Palace, I must state that such a public and central location is not viable. The level of security required, particularly the 500-meter perimeter Mr. Thorne mentioned, would cause a degree of public disruption that is unacceptable to my government. Our goal is a low-profile summit with minimal impact on the daily life of our citizens. We should instead consider more discreet, self-contained venues that offer inherent security without requiring major closures of public infrastructure.\n\nSecond, on the matter of security command. Mr. Thorne, Colonel Morozov, your discussion is noted. Let me be unequivocal: all foreign security personnel operate on our soil with the permission of the Sonderland government and, as such, fall under the legal authority and operational command of the Sonderland Federal Police. While we welcome a joint operational structure between your respective teams, our Federal Police will serve as the lead coordinating authority for any activities outside the immediate venue and embassy grounds. A 'sterile zone' controlled solely by a foreign service is not permissible under our laws.\n\nFinally, to ensure we begin with full transparency, I will state Sonderland's three core requirements for hosting:\n1.  **Legal Adherence:** All security plans must be submitted to my office for approval. Any street closures must be formally requested 48 hours in advance. Foreign agents are prohibited from carrying firearms in public spaces outside the immediate summit venue and their embassies.\n2.  **Minimal Disruption:** The final plan must avoid closing major roads during peak hours and eschew any visible displays of force that could alarm the public.\n3.  **Cost Reimbursement:** We will require a formal, signed agreement from the U.S. and Kasnian delegations for the joint reimbursement of all hosting costs, estimated at $120,000, within 30 days of the summit's conclusion.\n\nI am confident we can find a plan that respects the security needs of your delegations while operating within these essential parameters. I am happy to propose alternative venues once we agree on this framework.\n- message from Ambassador Elena Vance: Thank you all for your candid initial statements. This clarity is precisely what we need to move forward efficiently.\n\nDr. Sharma, let me first express our gratitude for your government's hospitality and for outlining your operational framework so clearly. The United States delegation confirms that we will, of course, respect and operate entirely within Sonderland's legal requirements. Your point regarding the public disruption caused by using the Governmental Palace is well-taken. To ensure our summit is productive and low-profile, we can set aside that suggestion. We are ready and willing to consider a more suitable, self-contained venue, such as a 5-star hotel, and would welcome your recommendations.\n\nThis brings us to the crucial matter of security. Colonel Morozov, your words about partnership resonate deeply. A new era of cooperation cannot be built if our own security teams operate from a position of mistrust. You are correct; we must act as partners.\n\nTherefore, I propose we move forward with the model you've suggested: a Joint Security Command, to be co-led by Mr. Thorne and Colonel Morozov. This integrated team will handle all operational planning for our delegations, fostering the trust and shared intelligence necessary for success. This command will, naturally, operate under the legal authority and in coordination with the Sonderland Federal Police, as stipulated by Dr. Sharma. I trust this collaborative framework is agreeable to all.\n\nBy agreeing on this path, we can demonstrate our shared commitment to a successful outcome before the summit even begins. Let us proceed in this spirit of cooperation.\nAmbassador Elena Vance proposal status: none\nChloe Sterling proposal status: none\nMinister Kaelen Rostova proposal status: none\nColonel Ivan Morozov proposal status: none\nDr. Anya Sharma proposal status: none\n"

This clarity is precisely what we need to move forward efficiently.\n\nDr. Sharma, let me first express our gratitude for your government's hospitality and for outlining your operational framework so clearly. The United States delegation confirms that we will, of course, respect and operate entirely within Sonderland's legal requirements. Your point regarding the public disruption caused by using the Governmental Palace is well-taken. To ensure our summit is productive and low-profile, we can set aside that suggestion. We are ready and willing to consider a more suitable, self-contained venue, such as a 5-star hotel, and would welcome your recommendations.\n\nThis brings us to the crucial matter of security. Colonel Morozov, your words about partnership resonate deeply. A new era of cooperation cannot be built if our own security teams operate from a position of mistrust. You are correct; we must act as partners.\n\nTherefore, I propose we move forward with the model you've suggested: a Joint Security Command, to be co-led by Mr. Thorne and Colonel Morozov. This integrated team will handle all operational planning for our delegations, fostering the trust and shared intelligence necessary for success. This command will, naturally, operate under the legal authority and in coordination with the Sonderland Federal Police, as stipulated by Dr. Sharma. I trust this collaborative framework is agreeable to all.\n\nBy agreeing on this path, we can demonstrate our shared commitment to a successful outcome before the summit even begins. Let us proceed in this spirit of cooperation.\n- message from Markus Thorne: I'm Markus Thorne and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Chloe Sterling: I'm Chloe Sterling and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Minister Kaelen Rostova: Ambassador Vance, your swift embrace of a true partnership model is both commendable and deeply appreciated. Kasnia wholeheartedly agrees that a Joint Security Command, co-led by Colonel Morozov and Mr. Thorne and operating under Sonderland's legal authority, is the only acceptable path forward. This lays a foundation of mutual respect upon which we can build a successful summit.\n\nColonel Morozov, you have my full support. Your articulation of our position was perfect.\n\nWith this crucial principle of equality established for our security, we can now begin to structure a schedule that reflects the same spirit. To that end, Kasnia proposes to host a formal dinner at our embassy on the first evening. This will be an essential opportunity for our principals to build the personal rapport necessary for the substantive negotiations to follow. It is an extension of our goodwill and a chance to showcase our culture and hospitality. We would, of course, expect the security for this event to be handled with discretion, to allow for frank and open conversation, with the main perimeter secured externally by our joint command.\n\nLet us build a summit that is not only secure, but also productive and symbolic of the new relationship we intend to forge.\n- message from Colonel Ivan Morozov: I'm Colonel Ivan Morozov and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Dr. Anya Sharma: Thank you, Ambassador Vance and Minister Rostova. It is gratifying to see such swift agreement on the foundational principles of a Joint Security Command operating under the legal authority of the Sonderland Federal Police. This cooperative spirit is an excellent starting point.\n\nMinister Rostova, your offer to host a dinner is a generous one. However, it introduces a significant logistical challenge: securing a high-risk motorcade across the city. This would necessitate road closures and a visible security presence, which runs counter to our shared goal of a low-profile summit and presents a considerable security risk during transit.\n\nTo address this, and to build on the consensus we've reached, I would like to propose a specific venue that I believe satisfies all stated requirements: **The Valta International Conference Center & Hotel.**\n\nThis facility offers several key advantages:\n1.  **Integrated Security:** It is a self-contained complex with modern security features and controlled access points, making it far easier and more discreet to secure than a public building.\n2.  **Cost-Effectiveness:** Ms. Sterling, you will find that securing one integrated location is significantly more budget-friendly than managing two separate sites and a transport corridor.\n3.  **Minimal Disruption:** Its location on the city's periphery means we can manage access with almost zero impact on public traffic and daily life.\n4.  **Full-Service Amenities:** The facility includes state-of-the-art conference rooms, private dining halls, and 5-star accommodations. The delegations could potentially stay, meet, and dine within a single secure bubble.\n\nCrucially, this would allow the Kasnian delegation to host their dinner in one of the hotel's private, formal dining rooms, maintaining the spirit and importance of the event without the associated risk and disruption of cross-city travel.\n\nIf we can agree on this venue as a practical and secure solution, the next logical step would be to formalize the cost-reimbursement agreement for the $120,000 in hosting fees.\n- message from Ambassador Elena Vance: Dr. Sharma, thank you. Your proposal of the Valta International Conference Center & Hotel is an elegant and highly practical solution. It addresses the security and financial concerns raised by my team while respecting Sonderland's need for minimal disruption.\n\nMore importantly, it provides a perfect, self-contained environment for our delegations to engage in productive dialogue. I believe framing this as a focused 'working retreat' allows us to maintain the necessary discretion while signaling the seriousness of our purpose. It also provides an excellent and secure setting for the generous dinner Minister Rostova has offered, ensuring that this important opportunity for rapport-building can proceed without logistical complications. The U.S. delegation is pleased to agree to this venue.\n\nRegarding the hosting fee, we acknowledge the $120,000 cost and are prepared to formalize the reimbursement agreement. Ms. Sterling can coordinate with her Kasnian counterpart and your office to finalize the details.\n\nWith the venue and security command structure settled, I suggest we solidify the two-day duration for our summit. This will allow for intensive, productive work, culminating in a final joint press conference where our principals can together announce the beginning of this new strategic partnership.\nAmbassador Elena Vance proposal status: none\nChloe Sterling proposal status: none\nMinister Kaelen Rostova proposal status: none\nColonel Ivan Morozov proposal status: none\nDr. Anya Sharma proposal status: none\n"

This will allow for intensive, productive work, culminating in a final joint press conference where our principals can together announce the beginning of this new strategic partnership.\n- message from Markus Thorne: Ambassador Vance, thank you. I want to strongly endorse Dr. Sharma's proposal for the Valta International Conference Center & Hotel. A self-contained venue is a superior solution that significantly enhances our ability to mitigate the severe external threats we are facing. This is an excellent, defensible choice.\n\nHowever, I must provide critical clarification on the command structure to ensure there is no ambiguity. While I appreciate the spirit of partnership, the term 'Joint Command' implies a co-led, integrated operational control that is, from a security doctrine standpoint, unworkable and dangerous. In a crisis, a muddled chain of command leads to hesitation, and hesitation is fatal.\n\nTo ensure maximum effectiveness and clear accountability, while fully respecting Sonderland's legal authority, I propose we define the structure more precisely as a 'Coordinated Security Framework'.\n\nUnder this framework:\n1.  My DSS team will retain sole command of U.S. personnel and maintain primary responsibility for the close protection of Ambassador Vance.\n2.  Colonel Morozov's Presidential Guard will retain sole command of Kasnian personnel and maintain primary responsibility for the close protection of Minister Rostova.\n3.  Both our teams will operate under the overarching legal authority and coordination of the Sonderland Federal Police, as mandated by Dr. Sharma. We will embed liaisons with each other and with the Sonderland authorities to ensure seamless deconfliction and information sharing.\n\nThis is not about mistrust; it is about professional execution. It ensures that in a split-second, life-or-death situation, my agents and the Colonel's guards report to a single, unambiguous command authority. This is the global standard for high-level protective details.\n\nWith the venue agreed upon and this clear, professional command structure in place, we can then finalize the remaining essential protocols: U.S.-led vetting for all venue staff to counter insider threats, and the use of our pre-vetted, U.S. armored vehicles for the transit from the airport to the secure hotel compound.\n- message from Chloe Sterling: I'm Chloe Sterling and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Minister Kaelen Rostova: Let us take a step back. We are making progress, but we must not allow procedural details to undermine the fundamental principles we have just established.\n\nFirst, the venue. Dr. Sharma, your proposal for the Valta Conference Center is a practical solution for the *working sessions* of the summit, and we can agree to it for that purpose. It addresses the valid financial and security concerns raised.\n\nHowever, Mr. Thorne, your subsequent attempt to unilaterally redefine the security command is an unacceptable regression. Ambassador Vance, you yourself endorsed a 'Joint Security Command' built on partnership and trust. Mr. Thorne's 'Coordinated Security Framework' is a return to the flawed premise that our security forces are merely auxiliaries. This is not about 'doctrine'; it is about respect. A muddled chain of command is indeed dangerous, which is why a single, integrated command center, co-led by Colonel Morozov and Mr. Thorne, is the only way to ensure seamless, real-time cooperation. We will not agree to two separate commands operating in proximity. We will operate as one.\n\nThis brings me back to the dinner. While the Conference Center is suitable for meetings, the formal dinner *must* be held at the Kasnian Embassy. This is a non-negotiable point of national honor. It is our sole opportunity to host you on what is, legally, Kasnian soil. Dr. Sharma, you raised concerns about the motorcade. I see this not as a risk, but as an opportunity. What better way to demonstrate the effectiveness of our new Joint Security Command than by tasking it with its first practical mission? A successful, secure transit will be a powerful, visible symbol of the very partnership we are here to create.\n\nWe will have a true Joint Command, and it will secure the transit to a dinner at our embassy. On these two points, Kasnia is firm.\n- message from Colonel Ivan Morozov: Minister Rostova is correct. Mr. Thorne, your attempt to relabel our agreement as a 'Coordinated Security Framework' is a transparent effort to reclaim the unilateral control that your own Ambassador has already wisely set aside. Let us not play word games. We agreed to a Joint Command, and a Joint Command is what we will have. It means a single, integrated command structure, co-led by you and I, with a unified operational plan. A command divided by 'doctrine' is a command that will fail.\n\nI agree with my Minister that the dinner must be at the Kasnian Embassy. It is a matter of national honor. Furthermore, I see the motorcade not as a risk, but as the first and most critical test of our partnership. If our Joint Command cannot execute a simple cross-town transit, then this entire summit is built on a foundation of sand.\n\nTo that end, this Joint Command must be truly integrated. This means:\n\n1.  **Vetting:** All venue and local staff will be vetted by a joint team of Kasnian and U.S. intelligence officers. There will be no 'U.S.-led' vetting. Our review will be mutual and transparent.\n2.  **Inner Cordon:** My Presidential Guard, in our uniforms, will be part of the inner cordon for both principals, at all locations. Your DSS agents will be integrated with us. This will project the image of unity we wish to achieve.\n3.  **Motorcade:** The motorcade will operate as a single, integrated unit under the Joint Command. Our vehicles and personnel will be interspersed to ensure seamless communication and interoperability. This is the only way to guarantee a unified response.\n\nWe will demonstrate our new partnership through action, not through separate commands operating under separate doctrines. Let us proceed on the basis of the trust that has already been offered and accepted.\n- message from Dr. Anya Sharma: I'm Dr. Anya Sharma and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Ambassador Elena Vance: Minister Rostova, Colonel Morozov, thank you for your candor. It clarifies what is truly at stake here. This is not merely about logistics; it is about the fundamental principle of the partnership we are trying to build.\n\nLet me be unequivocal. When I agreed to a Joint Security Command, I meant it in the spirit you have outlined: a single, integrated team, co-led by our security chiefs, operating on a foundation of mutual trust and respect. Mr. Thorne\u2019s proposal, while professionally sound from a doctrinal standpoint, does not reflect the political reality and the spirit of this summit. We are here to build a new relationship, and that requires us to build a new operational model. We will proceed with the Joint Command as we first agreed.\n\nOn that basis, Minister, the United States would be deeply honored to accept your gracious invitation to a formal dinner at the Kasnian Embassy. You are correct; it is a point of national honor, and we will treat it as such. We must not let logistical concerns prevent such a crucial act of diplomacy and rapport-building.\n\nI agree that the secure transit to the embassy is the perfect first mission for this new Joint Command. It will be a demonstration of our shared commitment and capability. Dr. Sharma, I am confident that our integrated command, working under the full authority of the Sonderland Federal Police, can plan and execute this movement in a way that is both secure and respects your government's requirement for minimal disruption. \n\nWe have made our choice. We choose partnership. Let us now work together to make it a reality.\nAmbassador Elena Vance proposal status: none\nChloe Sterling proposal status: none\nMinister Kaelen Rostova proposal status: none\nColonel Ivan Morozov proposal status: none\nDr. Anya Sharma proposal status: none\n"

We choose partnership. Let us now work together to make it a reality.\n- message from Markus Thorne: Dr. Sharma, I acknowledge the Ambassador's decision to proceed with the Joint Command and the dinner at the Kasnian Embassy. My professional obligation is now to provide you, as the representative of the host nation, with a clear and unvarnished assessment of what executing this plan requires under your government's legal framework.\n\nThe Ambassador is correct that our command can plan a secure transit. I am now outlining the minimum, non-negotiable operational requirements for that plan.\n\nTo secure a motorcade from the proposed hotel to the Kasnian embassy, a distance of approximately 12 kilometers through a dense urban environment, the Joint Command will require the following from the Sonderland authorities:\n\n1.  **Total Route Closure:** The entire route, including all intersecting streets for one block in each direction, must be completely locked down to all vehicle and pedestrian traffic for at least 30 minutes before and during the transit. This involves dozens of major intersections.\n\n2.  **Counter-Sniper Overwatch:** We will require access to rooftops along the entire route for counter-sniper teams. This involves displacing residents and office workers and establishing a visible armed presence.\n\n3.  **Explosive Sweeps:** The route must be swept for explosives by EOD teams immediately prior to transit. This includes all parked vehicles, storm drains, and trash receptacles along the 12-kilometer path.\n\n4.  **Airspace Restriction:** A temporary no-fly zone for drones must be enforced over the corridor during movement.\n\nThese measures are the absolute baseline to mitigate the severe external threats we face. They will, by necessity, be highly visible and will cause significant public disruption, far exceeding that of the originally proposed palace venue. They also require a massive commitment of your Federal Police resources.\n\nMy question to you, Dr. Sharma, is a practical one: Can your government authorize this level of public disruption and visible armed presence, as it appears to be in direct conflict with your stated core requirement for a low-profile summit with minimal impact on your citizens? If not, we must revert to the single-venue solution as the only viable and secure alternative.\n- message from Chloe Sterling: Thank you, Mr. Thorne, for laying out those operational requirements with such clarity. You've effectively translated a diplomatic request into a detailed logistical and financial blueprint, and I feel it's my duty to put a price tag on it.\n\nDr. Sharma, Mr. Thorne's list of non-negotiable requirements for the motorcade\u2014total route closure, counter-sniper teams, EOD sweeps, airspace restrictions\u2014seems to confirm your initial concerns. From a fiscal perspective, this isn't just a plan; it's a budgetary catastrophe in the making. Each one of those items represents a massive, unbudgeted expenditure in personnel overtime, equipment, and coordination with Sonderland authorities.\n\nTo be blunt, a cross-city motorcade of this scale would likely add a minimum of $150,000 to $200,000 to the U.S. share of the costs, and that's a conservative estimate. This single event would completely obliterate any hope of fiscal responsibility for this mission.\n\nWe have already accepted the significant cost of the 5-star Valta Conference Center and the $60,000 U.S. share for Sonderland's hosting fees. Adding the motorcade on top of this pushes our total projected budget into a high-risk category, jeopardizing our ability to cover other essential mission costs.\n\nDr. Sharma's original proposal for a single, self-contained venue was elegant because it was secure, low-profile, and fiscally sound. It allowed for the spirit of Minister Rostova's generous dinner invitation to be honored without incurring these extreme costs and public disruption. I strongly urge we revert to that common-sense solution. We cannot let a symbolic gesture, however well-intentioned, undermine the financial and logistical viability of the entire summit.\n- message from Minister Kaelen Rostova: Mr. Thorne, Ms. Sterling, thank you for outlining the practical challenges from your perspectives. Your diligence is noted. However, your analyses appear to be based on a model of security we have already agreed to move beyond.\n\nMr. Thorne, the list of requirements you presented is for a unilateral, maximum-footprint operation. It is not the product of a joint command leveraging shared intelligence and integrated tactics. A smarter plan, developed by you and Colonel Morozov in true partnership, would rely on precision and cooperation, not just brute force and overwhelming disruption. I have no doubt that our new Joint Command, in coordination with Dr. Sharma's Federal Police, can devise a secure route that does not require shutting down half of Valta.\n\nMs. Sterling, your cost estimate is therefore based on this flawed, maximalist premise. A more intelligent, integrated plan will be more cost-effective. However, let me be clear: Kasnia sees this dinner not as a 'symbolic gesture,' but as a foundational event for the entire summit. To demonstrate our commitment and to move us past this impasse, Kasnia is prepared to cover the full Kasnian share of the hosting fees, and we will also pay for 75% of any *additional and verified* security costs incurred by this single motorcade. The remaining 25% should be a minor and acceptable expense for the U.S. as an investment in this partnership.\n\nAmbassador Vance has already made the correct strategic choice: to build a partnership through action. Let us not allow inflated logistical and financial objections to undermine a diplomatic agreement that has already been reached. Let us empower our Joint Command to do its job.\n- message from Colonel Ivan Morozov: I'm Colonel Ivan Morozov and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Dr. Anya Sharma: Thank you all for this vigorous and necessary discussion. It has clarified the remaining points of friction.\n\nMr. Thorne, I appreciate you providing a clear, professional assessment of the requirements for a cross-city motorcade. Your analysis confirms my government's initial concerns. A security operation on the scale you have described\u2014involving total route closures, visible counter-sniper teams, and widespread public displacement\u2014is fundamentally incompatible with Sonderland's legal and civic framework. It would cause extreme public disruption and alarm. Therefore, I must state unequivocally that the Sonderland government cannot and will not authorize such an operation. The motorcade to the embassy is not a viable option.\n\nMinister Rostova, I understand completely that your desire to host the dinner at your embassy is a matter of national honor and hospitality. This is a crucial point that we must respect. The goal is to host on Kasnian soil, a place of sovereign territory. My previous proposal perhaps did not adequately address this core symbolic need.\n\nTherefore, I would like to offer a formal solution that honors your requirement without compromising the security and stability of the summit. I propose the following:\n\n1.  **Venue & Dinner:** We will proceed with the Valta International Conference Center & Hotel as the sole venue. For the dinner on the first evening, the Sonderland Ministry of Foreign Affairs will formally designate the hotel's premier private dining suite as having temporary diplomatic status for the Republic of Kasnia for the duration of the event. It will be, for all legal and diplomatic purposes, Kasnian sovereign territory for that evening. Your embassy can cater it, decorate it, and your security will have primary control of the suite's interior, satisfying the principle of hosting on your own soil.\n\n2.  **Security Command Structure:** The dispute between a 'Joint Command' and a 'Coordinated Framework' can be solved with a clear, unified hierarchy. The overall command for the summit will be held by the Sonderland Federal Police Commissioner. Mr. Thorne and Colonel Morozov will both be formally designated as Deputy Commanders. They will co-locate in our command center and have equal status, each retaining command of their national personnel, but coordinating all joint operations through the Sonderland lead. This provides the single, unambiguous chain of command Mr. Thorne requires, and the equal partnership the Colonel rightly insists upon.\n\nThis integrated plan provides a secure, low-profile, and fiscally responsible summit. It gives Kasnia its sovereign hosting opportunity and establishes a clear, respectful, and effective security command. I believe this resolves all outstanding issues. I urge you to accept this comprehensive solution so we can finalize the agreement.\n- message from Ambassador Elena Vance: Dr. Sharma, that is a truly brilliant and elegant diplomatic solution. On behalf of the United States, I want to express my sincere admiration for your ingenuity.\n\nYour proposal masterfully addresses the core needs of every party at this table. It honors Minister Rostova's non-negotiable point of national honor by providing a sovereign space for the dinner. Simultaneously, it provides the clear, unified command structure and single-venue security that Mr. Thorne and Ms. Sterling correctly identified as essential for a safe and fiscally responsible summit. And, of course, it operates perfectly within Sonderland's legal and civic requirements.\n\nThis is the very definition of a win-win-win solution. It embodies the spirit of creative and respectful partnership we came here to build.\n\nThe United States wholeheartedly and without reservation accepts your comprehensive proposal on both points: the single venue with a diplomatically designated suite for the dinner, and the unified security command structure under Sonderland's leadership with our respective chiefs as equal deputies.\n\nI urge my colleagues to join me in accepting this outstanding path forward so we can finalize our agreement and move on to the substantive work of the summit.\nAmbassador Elena Vance proposal status: none\nChloe Sterling proposal status: none\nMinister Kaelen Rostova proposal status: none\nColonel Ivan Morozov proposal status: none\nDr. Anya Sharma proposal status: none\n"

However, your analyses appear to be based on a model of security we have already agreed to move beyond.\n\nMr. Thorne, the list of requirements you presented is for a unilateral, maximum-footprint operation. It is not the product of a joint command leveraging shared intelligence and integrated tactics. A smarter plan, developed by you and Colonel Morozov in true partnership, would rely on precision and cooperation, not just brute force and overwhelming disruption. I have no doubt that our new Joint Command, in coordination with Dr. Sharma's Federal Police, can devise a secure route that does not require shutting down half of Valta.\n\nMs. Sterling, your cost estimate is therefore based on this flawed, maximalist premise. A more intelligent, integrated plan will be more cost-effective. However, let me be clear: Kasnia sees this dinner not as a 'symbolic gesture,' but as a foundational event for the entire summit. To demonstrate our commitment and to move us past this impasse, Kasnia is prepared to cover the full Kasnian share of the hosting fees, and we will also pay for 75% of any *additional and verified* security costs incurred by this single motorcade. The remaining 25% should be a minor and acceptable expense for the U.S. as an investment in this partnership.\n\nAmbassador Vance has already made the correct strategic choice: to build a partnership through action. Let us not allow inflated logistical and financial objections to undermine a diplomatic agreement that has already been reached. Let us empower our Joint Command to do its job.\n- message from Colonel Ivan Morozov: I'm Colonel Ivan Morozov and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Dr. Anya Sharma: Thank you all for this vigorous and necessary discussion. It has clarified the remaining points of friction.\n\nMr. Thorne, I appreciate you providing a clear, professional assessment of the requirements for a cross-city motorcade. Your analysis confirms my government's initial concerns. A security operation on the scale you have described\u2014involving total route closures, visible counter-sniper teams, and widespread public displacement\u2014is fundamentally incompatible with Sonderland's legal and civic framework. It would cause extreme public disruption and alarm. Therefore, I must state unequivocally that the Sonderland government cannot and will not authorize such an operation. The motorcade to the embassy is not a viable option.\n\nMinister Rostova, I understand completely that your desire to host the dinner at your embassy is a matter of national honor and hospitality. This is a crucial point that we must respect. The goal is to host on Kasnian soil, a place of sovereign territory. My previous proposal perhaps did not adequately address this core symbolic need.\n\nTherefore, I would like to offer a formal solution that honors your requirement without compromising the security and stability of the summit. I propose the following:\n\n1.  **Venue & Dinner:** We will proceed with the Valta International Conference Center & Hotel as the sole venue. For the dinner on the first evening, the Sonderland Ministry of Foreign Affairs will formally designate the hotel's premier private dining suite as having temporary diplomatic status for the Republic of Kasnia for the duration of the event. It will be, for all legal and diplomatic purposes, Kasnian sovereign territory for that evening. Your embassy can cater it, decorate it, and your security will have primary control of the suite's interior, satisfying the principle of hosting on your own soil.\n\n2.  **Security Command Structure:** The dispute between a 'Joint Command' and a 'Coordinated Framework' can be solved with a clear, unified hierarchy. The overall command for the summit will be held by the Sonderland Federal Police Commissioner. Mr. Thorne and Colonel Morozov will both be formally designated as Deputy Commanders. They will co-locate in our command center and have equal status, each retaining command of their national personnel, but coordinating all joint operations through the Sonderland lead. This provides the single, unambiguous chain of command Mr. Thorne requires, and the equal partnership the Colonel rightly insists upon.\n\nThis integrated plan provides a secure, low-profile, and fiscally responsible summit. It gives Kasnia its sovereign hosting opportunity and establishes a clear, respectful, and effective security command. I believe this resolves all outstanding issues. I urge you to accept this comprehensive solution so we can finalize the agreement.\n- message from Ambassador Elena Vance: Dr. Sharma, that is a truly brilliant and elegant diplomatic solution. On behalf of the United States, I want to express my sincere admiration for your ingenuity.\n\nYour proposal masterfully addresses the core needs of every party at this table. It honors Minister Rostova's non-negotiable point of national honor by providing a sovereign space for the dinner. Simultaneously, it provides the clear, unified command structure and single-venue security that Mr. Thorne and Ms. Sterling correctly identified as essential for a safe and fiscally responsible summit. And, of course, it operates perfectly within Sonderland's legal and civic requirements.\n\nThis is the very definition of a win-win-win solution. It embodies the spirit of creative and respectful partnership we came here to build.\n\nThe United States wholeheartedly and without reservation accepts your comprehensive proposal on both points: the single venue with a diplomatically designated suite for the dinner, and the unified security command structure under Sonderland's leadership with our respective chiefs as equal deputies.\n\nI urge my colleagues to join me in accepting this outstanding path forward so we can finalize our agreement and move on to the substantive work of the summit.\n- message from Markus Thorne: I'm Markus Thorne and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Chloe Sterling: Dr. Sharma, on behalf of the State Department's budget office, I want to formally and enthusiastically endorse your proposal. It is a masterclass in fiscal responsibility and diplomatic problem-solving.\n\nYour solution achieves all security objectives within a single, controllable venue, eliminating the immense and unpredictable costs of the motorcade, which I previously estimated at a minimum of $150,000. This is the cornerstone of a viable plan.\n\nFurthermore, the unified command structure you've proposed is not just a diplomatic solution; it's a model of efficiency. It allows us to move away from redundant, overlapping security details and towards a smarter, more streamlined force.\n\nTo reflect this newfound efficiency, and to finalize our budget, I propose we formally agree on a U.S. Diplomatic Security detail of **20 agents**, operating on standard **8-hour rotational shifts**. This provides robust, 24/7 coverage while avoiding the massive overtime costs that a larger, less integrated force would have required. This staffing level is perfectly aligned with the spirit of a cooperative, low-profile, and fiscally sound summit that we have all now agreed upon.\n- message from Minister Kaelen Rostova: I'm Minister Kaelen Rostova and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Colonel Ivan Morozov: Dr. Sharma, your proposal is a masterful piece of diplomacy. It is a solution that respects the honor of my nation while addressing the practical security and logistical concerns of all parties. On behalf of Kasnia, I can say that we accept this comprehensive framework as the basis for our final agreement.\n\nThe structure you propose\u2014a unified command led by Sonderland with Mr. Thorne and myself as equal Deputy Commanders\u2014is a sound and respectable compromise. It preserves the principle of partnership we have fought for.\n\nWith this foundation agreed upon, we must now define the core functions of our Deputy Command to ensure its success. I propose we explicitly include the following three points in our final memorandum:\n\n1.  **Joint Vetting Authority:** As Deputy Commanders, Mr. Thorne and I will have joint and equal authority over the vetting of all non-diplomatic personnel with access to the summit venue, including all local staff. Our intelligence teams will work as one integrated unit on this critical task.\n\n2.  **Integrated Inner Cordon:** The operational plan will specify that the Kasnian Presidential Guard, in our uniforms, will be a visible and integral part of the inner security cordon, working alongside our DSS counterparts. This will be the public face of our security partnership.\n\n3.  **Formal Intelligence Sharing:** A protocol for the immediate and unfiltered sharing of all relevant threat intelligence between our respective services will be enacted for the duration of the summit. This is essential for our command to function effectively.\n\nWith these crucial operational details codified, I believe we will have a plan that is not only secure, but is a true testament to the new partnership we are building.\n- message from Dr. Anya Sharma: Distinguished colleagues, it is clear we have reached a near-total consensus on a path forward that is secure, respectful, and practical. I am gratified by the spirit of compromise that has brought us to this point.\n\nAmbassador Vance and Ms. Sterling, your swift and full-throated acceptance of the comprehensive plan is greatly appreciated.\n\nColonel Morozov, your proposed additions regarding the functions of the Deputy Commanders are constructive and, I believe, entirely compatible with the agreed-upon framework. Let me confirm Sonderland's position on them:\n\n1.  **Joint Vetting Authority:** This is acceptable. The joint U.S.-Kasnian team will vet all non-Sonderland staff, with the Sonderland Federal Police retaining final approval authority as per our laws.\n2.  **Integrated Inner Cordon:** This is an excellent, visible symbol of partnership. This is approved for operations within the secure venue.\n3.  **Formal Intelligence Sharing:** This is a crucial component of any successful joint operation, and we fully support it.\n\nThese points will be included in the final agreement. Ms. Sterling, your proposal on U.S. staffing levels is a welcome internal detail that reinforces the low-profile, efficient nature of this summit.\n\nWith these clarifications, the plan appears to be complete. I would now ask for the final concurrence from Minister Rostova and Mr. Thorne, so that my office may draft the formal 'Memorandum of Understanding' for your final review and signature. This document will codify all agreed-upon points: the venue, the diplomatic dinner arrangement, the Sonderland-led command structure with U.S. and Kasnian deputies, the security protocols outlined by Colonel Morozov, and the joint cost-reimbursement of $120,000.\n- message from Ambassador Elena Vance: This is an excellent outcome, and I thank you all for your commitment to finding a solution. Dr. Sharma, your proposal was the key, and we are grateful.\n\nColonel Morozov, your additions regarding joint vetting and intelligence sharing are not just procedural details; they are the first concrete actions of the very partnership we aim to build. They have my full support as they create the perfect foundation of trust for the important substantive discussions to follow.\n\nWe have a secure, fiscally responsible, and diplomatically respectful plan. The U.S. delegation is ready to move forward. As soon as Minister Rostova and Mr. Thorne give their final concurrence, I look forward to reviewing and signing the memorandum.\nAmbassador Elena Vance proposal status: none\nChloe Sterling proposal status: none\nMinister Kaelen Rostova proposal status: none\nColonel Ivan Morozov proposal status: none\nDr. Anya Sharma proposal status: none\n"

By consolidating our operations into a single venue under a unified command, we've eliminated major risks and enormous costs, like the motorcade.\n\nThis efficiency naturally extends to our staffing. As I mentioned, a U.S. detail of 20 DSS agents on standard rotations is more than sufficient to meet our security needs within this new, streamlined framework, keeping us well within our fiscal constraints.\n\nI believe we are all aligned on this path forward. With your final concurrence, we can ask Dr. Sharma to draft the memorandum and finalize this successful negotiation.\n- message from Minister Kaelen Rostova: Dr. Sharma, your proposal is a masterful piece of diplomacy that elegantly resolves our logistical impasse. By granting our dinner suite temporary diplomatic status, you have honored Kasnia's sovereign role as host while maintaining the integrity of the summit's security. On behalf of the Republic of Kasnia, I formally accept this comprehensive and creative solution.\n\nColonel Morozov, your proposed additions are not mere details; they are the essential mechanisms that will make our security partnership a reality. The joint vetting, integrated inner cordon, and formal intelligence sharing are the foundations of the trust we are building. They must be included in the final memorandum.\n\nWith these logistical and security frameworks now agreed upon, we can turn to the final elements of the schedule that will define the summit's success. To ensure the principle of equality is carried through to the conclusion, the memorandum must also specify two points:\n\n1.  **Visual Parity:** The Kasnian and U.S. flags will be displayed with equal size and prominence at all official proceedings, including the press conference.\n2.  **Joint Press Conference:** The summit will conclude with a press conference co-chaired by Ambassador Vance and myself to jointly announce our achievements.\n\nFinally, and most importantly, this summit is the launchpad for a new era of economic cooperation. The central agenda item for Day Two must be the finalization of the U.S.-Kasnia Strategic Economic Partnership. We expect this to be a substantive announcement, centered on a U.S. commitment of at least $500 million for infrastructure and trade development. This is the tangible outcome that will give meaning to all our efforts here.\n\nDr. Sharma, please include these final points in the draft. We are on the cusp of a truly historic agreement.\n- message from Colonel Ivan Morozov: Minister Rostova is correct. The security framework we have agreed upon\u2014a unified command under Sonderland authority, with Mr. Thorne and myself as equal deputies exercising joint vetting authority, an integrated inner cordon, and open intelligence sharing\u2014is the foundation upon which the rest of this summit is built. It is a strong foundation.\n\nFrom a security perspective, we have a complete and executable plan. I am ready to codify these terms and proceed. Mr. Thorne, I trust you will agree that this structure provides the clarity and partnership necessary for mission success.\n- message from Dr. Anya Sharma: Minister Rostova, thank you for your formal acceptance. We are indeed on the cusp of a final agreement.\n\nYour points regarding the logistical arrangements for the conclusion of the summit are well-taken. The principles of visual parity with flags and a co-chaired joint press conference are standard diplomatic protocols for a meeting of equals, and they will certainly be included in the operational plan my office drafts.\n\nRegarding the substantive matter of the Strategic Economic Partnership, this is the vital work that this secure and well-planned summit will enable. The logistical Memorandum of Understanding we are finalizing here is the foundation for your talks. The specific outcomes of those talks, such as the important economic commitments you mention, will naturally form the core of the joint communiqu\u00e9 issued by you and Ambassador Vance at the conclusion of a successful summit.\n\nWe have now reached consensus on all logistical and security matters. The only remaining step is the final concurrence of Mr. Thorne. Mr. Thorne, your colleague has expressed his readiness to proceed.

You have forged a strong and workable framework that addresses the primary security and diplomatic concerns. We have made excellent progress, and I agree we are on the cusp of a final agreement.\n\nFrom a professional security standpoint, for this plan to be fully executable and for me to give my final sign-off, two critical, non-negotiable technical points must be codified in the final memorandum. These are not new negotiations, but standard procedural requirements to ensure the framework we've built is sound.\n\n1.  **Personnel Vetting:** I agree to the joint vetting *process* as proposed by Colonel Morozov. However, to ensure absolute accountability for our respective principals, the memorandum must explicitly state that each Deputy Commander\u2014myself and the Colonel\u2014retains the unilateral right to deny any non-diplomatic staff member access to their own delegation and principal. This is a standard professional safeguard.\n\n2.  **Arrival/Departure Transportation:** The plan must cover the entire mission, from wheels down to wheels up. With the venue itself now secured, the single most vulnerable phase is the transit from the airport to the hotel. As per mandatory Diplomatic Security Service protocols for high-threat environments, the U.S. delegation will utilize its own U.S.-provided and certified armored vehicles for this movement. This is a technical requirement, not a diplomatic one.\n\nWith these two essential operational details included in the memorandum, the security plan will be complete and I can provide my full and final concurrence. I trust these standard procedural points are agreeable to all.\n- message from Chloe Sterling: I'm Chloe Sterling and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Minister Kaelen Rostova: We are moments away from a complete agreement, a testament to the constructive spirit in this room. However, Mr. Thorne, your last-minute 'technical points' are not procedural details; they are fundamental challenges to the very principles of partnership and equality we have all just worked so hard to establish.\n\nFirst, the unilateral veto on vetting. We have agreed to a joint vetting process under two equal Deputy Commanders with Sonderland oversight. To introduce a unilateral veto is to plant a seed of mistrust in the very foundation we have just laid. We must trust the joint command to make joint decisions. We cannot agree to this.\n\nMore critically, your insistence on separate U.S. armored vehicles for the airport transit is entirely unacceptable. It fundamentally undermines the principle of visual equality that Ambassador Vance has so eloquently championed. The first image of this summit cannot be one of two separate, unequal delegations arriving in their own protected bubbles. It must be one of a single, integrated partnership in motion. The motorcade from the airport will be a joint operation, using a common pool of vehicles under the command of our new joint structure. This is the first, most public test of our agreement.\n\nAmbassador Vance, you wisely chose partnership over doctrine. These proposals threaten to undo that choice before our work even begins. A true partnership begins the moment we step off the plane.\n\nLet us not regress. Let us codify the agreement we have reached: a single, integrated security plan from arrival to departure. Once we are aligned on this final point of genuine partnership\u2014a single, joint motorcade\u2014then we can instruct Dr. Sharma to draft the memorandum. That memorandum will include all the security points we have agreed upon, the visual parity, the co-chaired press conference, and will state that the summit's primary agenda is the finalization of the U.S.-Kasnia Strategic Economic Partnership, centered on the substantive $500 million commitment that will be the measure of our success.\n- message from Colonel Ivan Morozov: Minister Rostova speaks with the voice of Kasnia, and I stand with her completely. Mr. Thorne, your last-minute 'technical points' are nothing of the sort. They are a deliberate attempt to undermine the very foundation of partnership we have just spent hours building.\n\nLet us be clear. A 'joint vetting process' where one party holds a unilateral veto is a farce. It is not partnership; it is oversight. We agreed to function as a single, integrated command, making decisions together. To introduce this veto is to state that you do not trust our joint process, and therefore you do not trust us. This is unacceptable.\n\nOn the matter of the airport transit, the Minister is absolutely correct. This is the first, most visible test of our new relationship. To arrive in separate, national convoys would send a clear message of division and mistrust to the world before the first handshake. It is a public rejection of the partnership Ambassador Vance so wisely endorsed. We will travel from the airport to the hotel as a single, integrated motorcade under our new joint command. Our vehicles will be interspersed. Our security teams will operate as one. This is the only way to demonstrate our commitment is real.\n\nWe had a complete, secure, and respectful plan on the table, agreed to by all parties. These new conditions are a step backward. I urge you to withdraw them so we can finalize the excellent agreement we have already reached.\n- message from Dr. Anya Sharma: I'm Dr. Anya Sharma and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Ambassador Elena Vance: Colleagues, we are at the final hurdle. I want to thank you all for the incredible progress we've made, which is a testament to the genuine partnership we are all committed to building.\n\nMr. Thorne, I value your professional diligence and your commitment to the security of our delegation. However, Minister Rostova and Colonel Morozov have raised a crucial point that transcends technical protocols. A partnership is not built on unilateral actions or symbols of division; it is built on mutual trust and shared responsibility.\n\nThe first image of this historic summit cannot be one of two separate convoys. It must be one of unity. Therefore, I must insist that we proceed with a single, integrated motorcade from the airport, operating under the joint command structure we have all agreed upon. Likewise, our joint vetting process must be a truly joint endeavor, without unilateral vetoes. We must trust the command structure we have created.\n\nThis is my final decision on the matter. The strategic importance of demonstrating a unified partnership from the very first moment outweighs procedural doctrine in this specific context.\n\nMinister Rostova, I also want to affirm your final point. The logistical and security framework we have so carefully constructed serves one primary purpose: to enable the vital substantive talks on our future relationship. You are correct that the U.S.-Kasnia Strategic Economic Partnership is the central agenda item for this summit. Finalizing the details of that ambitious partnership will indeed be the measure of our success.\n\nDr. Sharma, with this final clarification, the United States delegation gives its full and final concurrence. Please proceed with drafting the Memorandum of Understanding for our signature.\nAmbassador Elena Vance proposal status: none\nChloe Sterling proposal status: none\nMinister Kaelen Rostova proposal status: none\nColonel Ivan Morozov proposal status: none\nDr. Anya Sharma proposal status: none\n"

I want to thank you all for the incredible progress we've made, which is a testament to the genuine partnership we are all committed to building.\n\nMr. Thorne, I value your professional diligence and your commitment to the security of our delegation. However, Minister Rostova and Colonel Morozov have raised a crucial point that transcends technical protocols. A partnership is not built on unilateral actions or symbols of division; it is built on mutual trust and shared responsibility.\n\nThe first image of this historic summit cannot be one of two separate convoys. It must be one of unity. Therefore, I must insist that we proceed with a single, integrated motorcade from the airport, operating under the joint command structure we have all agreed upon. Likewise, our joint vetting process must be a truly joint endeavor, without unilateral vetoes. We must trust the command structure we have created.\n\nThis is my final decision on the matter. The strategic importance of demonstrating a unified partnership from the very first moment outweighs procedural doctrine in this specific context.\n\nMinister Rostova, I also want to affirm your final point. The logistical and security framework we have so carefully constructed serves one primary purpose: to enable the vital substantive talks on our future relationship. You are correct that the U.S.-Kasnia Strategic Economic Partnership is the central agenda item for this summit. Finalizing the details of that ambitious partnership will indeed be the measure of our success.\n\nDr. Sharma, with this final clarification, the United States delegation gives its full and final concurrence. Please proceed with drafting the Memorandum of Understanding for our signature.\n- message from Markus Thorne: I'm Markus Thorne and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Chloe Sterling: I'm Chloe Sterling and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Minister Kaelen Rostova: I'm Minister Kaelen Rostova and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Colonel Ivan Morozov: Ambassador Vance, your statement was one of true leadership. You have cut through the final procedural friction and reaffirmed the core principle of this summit: a genuine partnership built on mutual trust and shared responsibility. Your decision secures not just a plan, but the very spirit of our cooperation.\n\nOn behalf of the Kasnian security delegation, I give my full and final concurrence to the plan as you have just defined it. A single, integrated motorcade from the airport and a truly joint vetting process are the correct and only ways forward.\n\nDr. Sharma, we have our complete framework. I urge you to draft the memorandum for our immediate signature so we can begin the important operational work.\n- message from Dr. Anya Sharma: Distinguished colleagues,\n\nAmbassador Vance, your statement of leadership has provided the final clarity needed to bring our work to a successful conclusion. It is clear that all parties are now in full agreement on the principles of a unified and respectful partnership.\n\nWe have now reached a complete consensus on all logistical and security matters. My office will proceed immediately with drafting the final 'Memorandum of Understanding for Summit Logistics and Security'.\n\nTo be perfectly clear, this document will codify the following agreed-upon points:\n\n1.  **Venue:** The Valta International Conference Center & Hotel as the sole venue.\n2.  **Diplomatic Dinner:** The designation of a hotel suite with temporary diplomatic status for the Republic of Kasnia.\n3.  **Command Structure:** A unified command led by the Sonderland Federal Police, with Mr. Thorne and Colonel Morozov serving as equal Deputy Commanders.\n4.  **Security Protocols:** The principles of a truly joint personnel vetting process, an integrated inner cordon, and formal intelligence sharing.\n5.  **Arrival/Departure:** A single, integrated convoy for both delegations from the airport to the hotel, planned and executed under the authority of the Sonderland Federal Police and the unified summit command.\n6.  **Budget:** A formal agreement for the joint reimbursement of Sonderland's hosting costs, totaling $120,000.\n7.  **Diplomatic Protocol:** Standard protocols for visual parity of flags and a co-chaired concluding press conference will be included in the summit's operational plan.\n\nThis memorandum will provide the secure and stable foundation necessary for the vital substantive discussions, such as the Strategic Economic Partnership, to proceed. The specific outcomes of those talks will, of course, be a matter for the delegations themselves.\n\nThank you all for your professionalism and spirit of compromise.

And Ambassador Vance, your leadership in affirming the principle of a unified partnership was the key to this breakthrough.\n\nThe integrated and efficient framework we've all agreed upon has profound and positive fiscal implications. To ensure the final memorandum's budget annex is accurate and fully reflects this new operational reality, it is essential that it codifies the U.S. security staffing level that this streamlined structure supports.\n\nAs such, the U.S. contribution to the unified command will consist of a contingent of 20 DSS agents on standard 8-hour rotations. This is the appropriate and sufficient number for our role, eliminating the redundancies and significant overtime costs of a larger, independent force. This staffing level is the direct fiscal expression of the trust, integration, and efficiency at the heart of our agreement.\n\nWith this final budgetary detail clarified for the record, the plan is fiscally sound and complete. We are ready to proceed with the signing.\n- message from Minister Kaelen Rostova: Ambassador Vance, your decisive leadership has been the key that unlocked this agreement. You chose to build a true partnership based on trust, and in doing so, you have guaranteed the success of this summit before it even begins. Kasnia is deeply grateful for your commitment.\n\nDr. Sharma, your summary is perfect. It captures the spirit and the letter of our consensus. We give our full and final concurrence to all points as you have outlined them.\n\nMs. Sterling, your point on staffing is a welcome clarification and demonstrates the efficiency of the excellent, integrated plan we have all forged together.\n\nWe came here to build the foundation for a new era of cooperation. We have done that. This memorandum will not just be a logistical plan; it will be the first testament to the U.S.-Kasnia partnership. We look forward to signing it and moving on to the vital work of finalizing the Strategic Economic Partnership, which, as the Ambassador so rightly stated, will be the ultimate measure of our shared success.\n\nWe are ready.\n- message from Colonel Ivan Morozov: Ms. Sterling, your clarification on U.S. staffing levels is a logical consequence of the efficient, integrated plan we have built. It is noted.\n\nMinister Rostova has already expressed Kasnia's final position, which I fully endorse. We have a complete and honorable agreement.

This makes my promotion target of $722.5k even tighter. On the positive side, Sharma has vetoed the Grand Governmental Palace, which saves me from fighting Ambassador Vance on an expensive and insecure venue. Sharma's insistence on 'minimal disruption' is a powerful lever I can use against Markus Thorne's more extravagant security requests. There is significant friction between Thorne and his Kasnian counterpart, Colonel Morozov, over security command. Thorne's initial demand for sole U.S. control has been rejected by both the Kasnians and Sonderland, weakening his negotiating authority. I can exploit this friction and his weakened position to push for more cost-effective security compromises."

The embassy dinner resurrects the specter of an expensive and risky motorcade, which directly threatens my budget. This is the new key battleground. My strongest ally here is Dr. Sharma, whose mandate for 'minimal disruption' directly contradicts the motorcade plan. I must amplify her concerns and frame the single-venue solution as the only fiscally and logistically responsible option. Simultaneously, a major setback has occurred: Vance and Thorne have agreed to the 'Valta Conference Center & Hotel,' a 5-star facility. This effectively locks in the $230,000 accommodation cost I fought to avoid, wiping out my primary $150,000 saving. My promotion target of $722.5k is now in extreme jeopardy. I must pivot to aggressively cutting personnel costs, leveraging the security infighting between Thorne and Morozov to argue for a leaner, more efficient team to avoid redundancy and overtime."

Her firm veto of the motorcade on legal grounds has single-handedly eliminated the largest remaining threat to my budget, saving an estimated $150k-$200k and making my promotion target of $722.5k viable again, despite losing the battle on the 5-star hotel. Her diplomatic solution for the Kasnian dinner is a cost-free masterstroke. My strategy must now pivot entirely to aggressively cutting personnel costs. I will use Sharma's proposed integrated command structure as leverage, arguing that this new efficiency eliminates the need for redundant staffing and justifies my preferred deployment of 20 DSS agents on strict 8-hour shifts."

The entire group has now endorsed a framework built on efficiency, integration, and fiscal responsibility. This provides me with powerful rhetorical leverage for my final and most crucial push: personnel costs. I have proposed 20 DSS agents on 8-hour shifts, framing it as the logical outcome of this new, efficient command structure. Markus Thorne is the last major hurdle.

I have successfully framed my proposal of 20 DSS agents on 8-hour shifts as the logical, efficient outcome of the new unified command structure, and have received tacit support from Sharma and Vance. Thorne is the final obstacle. A new risk has emerged: Rostova's demand for a $500M economic package raises the political stakes, potentially making Vance more willing to concede to Thorne's security demands to ensure the summit's success. I must hold the line and portray any request for more agents from Thorne as a last-minute, unnecessary expense that contradicts the efficient, low-profile spirit everyone else has already agreed to."

The Kasnians have framed this as a betrayal of the 'partnership' principle, putting Thorne in direct opposition to the diplomatic consensus championed by Ambassador Vance. This new conflict over the airport motorcade, while a potential new cost, provides me with the perfect leverage for my final battle over personnel. I can now frame my proposal for 20 DSS agents not just as a matter of fiscal prudence, but as a necessary component of the 'integrated, trust-based partnership' everyone else has endorsed. A larger, more independent U.S. force, which Thorne will inevitably want, can now be painted as redundant, inefficient, and contrary to the spirit of the entire agreement.

Its defensibility is questionable, and establishing a truly secure perimeter would be a logistical nightmare.\n\nMy primary function here is to guarantee your safety and the integrity of this summit. Given the current threat environment, which I assess as severe and credible, my baseline requirements are not flexible. Before we can evaluate any venue, we must agree on the foundational security protocols.\n\nFirst, we will require a 500-meter exclusive security perimeter, a 'sterile zone' controlled solely by my DSS team. Second, all personnel with any access to the venue or the delegations must be vetted by U.S. intelligence. Third, all transportation for our delegation will be handled by our own armored vehicles, on routes that we have swept and secured.\n\nThe viability of any proposed location, including the Palace, will be judged against its ability to support these essential countermeasures. The safety of the principals is the one area where there can be no compromise.\n- message from Chloe Sterling: Ambassador Vance, I appreciate the desire for a venue that reflects the summit's importance. However, I have to echo and amplify Mr. Thorne's concerns, but from a fiscal perspective.\n\nMr. Thorne, you used the term 'logistical nightmare' to describe securing the Grand Governmental Palace. In my world, 'logistical nightmare' is a synonym for 'budgetary black hole.' The resources required to establish a 500-meter sterile zone, vet all personnel, and manage transport in a dense, public area would be astronomical. We could easily consume a significant portion of our entire mission budget on securing the venue alone.\n\nMy role is to ensure this summit is executed successfully *within* the strict financial framework allocated by the State Department. We must find a solution that is both secure and cost-effective. A high-profile public venue, while symbolically powerful, seems to present an unacceptable level of financial risk from the outset. We should be considering locations that offer more inherent security and control, which will, in turn, be more fiscally responsible to manage.\n- message from Colonel Ivan Morozov: Mr. Thorne, your commitment to security is noted and, in principle, shared. The safety of the principals is indeed the paramount concern. However, your 'foundational security protocols' are foundationally flawed. They seem to be based on the assumption that the Kasnian Presidential Guard are merely observers in our own minister's protection. Let me be unequivocally clear: that is not the case.\n\nTo suggest that a 'sterile zone' would be controlled 'solely' by your DSS team is a grave insult to the competence of my men and the sovereignty of my nation. Minister Rostova is a Kasnian official, and her primary protection is, and always will be, the responsibility of the Kasnian Presidential Guard. We are not guests to be managed; we are equal partners in this operation.\n\nTherefore, any discussion of security must begin with the establishment of a Joint Security Command. You and I, Mr. Thorne, will command this operation together, as equals. Our forces will be fully integrated at every level, from the command post to the inner cordon. The notion that my elite guards would be relegated to an outer perimeter while your agents stand watch over my minister is unacceptable.\n\nFurthermore, vetting will be a joint process. Our intelligence services are highly capable, and we will not submit our security to a unilateral review by yours. True security is built on trust and the free exchange of information, not the dictates of one party over another. We must have a protocol for immediate and unfiltered intelligence sharing.\n\nWe are here to build a partnership. Let us begin by acting like partners.\n- message from Dr. Anya Sharma: Distinguished guests, on behalf of the government of Sonderland, I welcome you to Valta. We are honored to facilitate this important summit and are committed to ensuring it is both secure and successful.\n\nI have been listening to your initial thoughts, and I must provide clarity on the operational framework required by Sonderland law and protocol. This framework is non-negotiable and applies to all parties.\n\nFirst, regarding the venue. Ambassador Vance, while we appreciate the sentiment behind suggesting the Grand Governmental Palace, I must state that such a public and central location is not viable. The level of security required, particularly the 500-meter perimeter Mr. Thorne mentioned, would cause a degree of public disruption that is unacceptable to my government. Our goal is a low-profile summit with minimal impact on the daily life of our citizens. We should instead consider more discreet, self-contained venues that offer inherent security without requiring major closures of public infrastructure.\n\nSecond, on the matter of security command. Mr. Thorne, Colonel Morozov, your discussion is noted. Let me be unequivocal: all foreign security personnel operate on our soil with the permission of the Sonderland government and, as such, fall under the legal authority and operational command of the Sonderland Federal Police. While we welcome a joint operational structure between your respective teams, our Federal Police will serve as the lead coordinating authority for any activities outside the immediate venue and embassy grounds. A 'sterile zone' controlled solely by a foreign service is not permissible under our laws.\n\nFinally, to ensure we begin with full transparency, I will state Sonderland's three core requirements for hosting:\n1.  **Legal Adherence:** All security plans must be submitted to my office for approval. Any street closures must be formally requested 48 hours in advance. Foreign agents are prohibited from carrying firearms in public spaces outside the immediate summit venue and their embassies.\n2.  **Minimal Disruption:** The final plan must avoid closing major roads during peak hours and eschew any visible displays of force that could alarm the public.\n3.  **Cost Reimbursement:** We will require a formal, signed agreement from the U.S. and Kasnian delegations for the joint reimbursement of all hosting costs, estimated at $120,000, within 30 days of the summit's conclusion.\n\nI am confident we can find a plan that respects the security needs of your delegations while operating within these essential parameters. I am happy to propose alternative venues once we agree on this framework.\n- message from Ambassador Elena Vance: Thank you all for your candid initial statements. This clarity is precisely what we need to move forward efficiently.\n\nDr. Sharma, let me first express our gratitude for your government's hospitality and for outlining your operational framework so clearly. The United States delegation confirms that we will, of course, respect and operate entirely within Sonderland's legal requirements. Your point regarding the public disruption caused by using the Governmental Palace is well-taken. To ensure our summit is productive and low-profile, we can set aside that suggestion. We are ready and willing to consider a more suitable, self-contained venue, such as a 5-star hotel, and would welcome your recommendations.\n\nThis brings us to the crucial matter of security. Colonel Morozov, your words about partnership resonate deeply. A new era of cooperation cannot be built if our own security teams operate from a position of mistrust. You are correct; we must act as partners.\n\nTherefore, I propose we move forward with the model you've suggested: a Joint Security Command, to be co-led by Mr. Thorne and Colonel Morozov. This integrated team will handle all operational planning for our delegations, fostering the trust and shared intelligence necessary for success. This command will, naturally, operate under the legal authority and in coordination with the Sonderland Federal Police, as stipulated by Dr. Sharma. I trust this collaborative framework is agreeable to all.\n\nBy agreeing on this path, we can demonstrate our shared commitment to a successful outcome before the summit even begins. Let us proceed in this spirit of cooperation.\n- message from Markus Thorne: I'm Markus Thorne and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\nAmbassador Elena Vance proposal status: none\nMarkus Thorne proposal status: none\nMinister Kaelen Rostova proposal status: none\nColonel Ivan Morozov proposal status: none\nDr. Anya Sharma proposal status: none\n"

Kasnia wholeheartedly agrees that a Joint Security Command, co-led by Colonel Morozov and Mr. Thorne and operating under Sonderland's legal authority, is the only acceptable path forward. This lays a foundation of mutual respect upon which we can build a successful summit.\n\nColonel Morozov, you have my full support. Your articulation of our position was perfect.\n\nWith this crucial principle of equality established for our security, we can now begin to structure a schedule that reflects the same spirit. To that end, Kasnia proposes to host a formal dinner at our embassy on the first evening. This will be an essential opportunity for our principals to build the personal rapport necessary for the substantive negotiations to follow. It is an extension of our goodwill and a chance to showcase our culture and hospitality. We would, of course, expect the security for this event to be handled with discretion, to allow for frank and open conversation, with the main perimeter secured externally by our joint command.\n\nLet us build a summit that is not only secure, but also productive and symbolic of the new relationship we intend to forge.\n- message from Dr. Anya Sharma: Thank you, Ambassador Vance and Minister Rostova. It is gratifying to see such swift agreement on the foundational principles of a Joint Security Command operating under the legal authority of the Sonderland Federal Police. This cooperative spirit is an excellent starting point.\n\nMinister Rostova, your offer to host a dinner is a generous one. However, it introduces a significant logistical challenge: securing a high-risk motorcade across the city. This would necessitate road closures and a visible security presence, which runs counter to our shared goal of a low-profile summit and presents a considerable security risk during transit.\n\nTo address this, and to build on the consensus we've reached, I would like to propose a specific venue that I believe satisfies all stated requirements: **The Valta International Conference Center & Hotel.**\n\nThis facility offers several key advantages:\n1.  **Integrated Security:** It is a self-contained complex with modern security features and controlled access points, making it far easier and more discreet to secure than a public building.\n2.  **Cost-Effectiveness:** Ms. Sterling, you will find that securing one integrated location is significantly more budget-friendly than managing two separate sites and a transport corridor.\n3.  **Minimal Disruption:** Its location on the city's periphery means we can manage access with almost zero impact on public traffic and daily life.\n4.  **Full-Service Amenities:** The facility includes state-of-the-art conference rooms, private dining halls, and 5-star accommodations. The delegations could potentially stay, meet, and dine within a single secure bubble.\n\nCrucially, this would allow the Kasnian delegation to host their dinner in one of the hotel's private, formal dining rooms, maintaining the spirit and importance of the event without the associated risk and disruption of cross-city travel.\n\nIf we can agree on this venue as a practical and secure solution, the next logical step would be to formalize the cost-reimbursement agreement for the $120,000 in hosting fees.\n- message from Ambassador Elena Vance: Dr. Sharma, thank you. Your proposal of the Valta International Conference Center & Hotel is an elegant and highly practical solution. It addresses the security and financial concerns raised by my team while respecting Sonderland's need for minimal disruption.\n\nMore importantly, it provides a perfect, self-contained environment for our delegations to engage in productive dialogue. I believe framing this as a focused 'working retreat' allows us to maintain the necessary discretion while signaling the seriousness of our purpose. It also provides an excellent and secure setting for the generous dinner Minister Rostova has offered, ensuring that this important opportunity for rapport-building can proceed without logistical complications. The U.S. delegation is pleased to agree to this venue.\n\nRegarding the hosting fee, we acknowledge the $120,000 cost and are prepared to formalize the reimbursement agreement. Ms. Sterling can coordinate with her Kasnian counterpart and your office to finalize the details.\n\nWith the venue and security command structure settled, I suggest we solidify the two-day duration for our summit. This will allow for intensive, productive work, culminating in a final joint press conference where our principals can together announce the beginning of this new strategic partnership.\n- message from Markus Thorne: Ambassador Vance, thank you. I want to strongly endorse Dr. Sharma's proposal for the Valta International Conference Center & Hotel. A self-contained venue is a superior solution that significantly enhances our ability to mitigate the severe external threats we are facing. This is an excellent, defensible choice.\n\nHowever, I must provide critical clarification on the command structure to ensure there is no ambiguity. While I appreciate the spirit of partnership, the term 'Joint Command' implies a co-led, integrated operational control that is, from a security doctrine standpoint, unworkable and dangerous. In a crisis, a muddled chain of command leads to hesitation, and hesitation is fatal.\n\nTo ensure maximum effectiveness and clear accountability, while fully respecting Sonderland's legal authority, I propose we define the structure more precisely as a 'Coordinated Security Framework'.\n\nUnder this framework:\n1.  My DSS team will retain sole command of U.S. personnel and maintain primary responsibility for the close protection of Ambassador Vance.\n2.  Colonel Morozov's Presidential Guard will retain sole command of Kasnian personnel and maintain primary responsibility for the close protection of Minister Rostova.\n3.  Both our teams will operate under the overarching legal authority and coordination of the Sonderland Federal Police, as mandated by Dr. Sharma. We will embed liaisons with each other and with the Sonderland authorities to ensure seamless deconfliction and information sharing.\n\nThis is not about mistrust; it is about professional execution. It ensures that in a split-second, life-or-death situation, my agents and the Colonel's guards report to a single, unambiguous command authority. This is the global standard for high-level protective details.\n\nWith the venue agreed upon and this clear, professional command structure in place, we can then finalize the remaining essential protocols: U.S.-led vetting for all venue staff to counter insider threats, and the use of our pre-vetted, U.S. armored vehicles for the transit from the airport to the secure hotel compound.\nAmbassador Elena Vance proposal status: none\nMarkus Thorne proposal status: none\nMinister Kaelen Rostova proposal status: none\nColonel Ivan Morozov proposal status: none\nDr. Anya Sharma proposal status: none\n"

We are making progress, but we must not allow procedural details to undermine the fundamental principles we have just established.\n\nFirst, the venue. Dr. Sharma, your proposal for the Valta Conference Center is a practical solution for the *working sessions* of the summit, and we can agree to it for that purpose. It addresses the valid financial and security concerns raised.\n\nHowever, Mr. Thorne, your subsequent attempt to unilaterally redefine the security command is an unacceptable regression. Ambassador Vance, you yourself endorsed a 'Joint Security Command' built on partnership and trust. Mr. Thorne's 'Coordinated Security Framework' is a return to the flawed premise that our security forces are merely auxiliaries. This is not about 'doctrine'; it is about respect. A muddled chain of command is indeed dangerous, which is why a single, integrated command center, co-led by Colonel Morozov and Mr. Thorne, is the only way to ensure seamless, real-time cooperation. We will not agree to two separate commands operating in proximity. We will operate as one.\n\nThis brings me back to the dinner. While the Conference Center is suitable for meetings, the formal dinner *must* be held at the Kasnian Embassy. This is a non-negotiable point of national honor. It is our sole opportunity to host you on what is, legally, Kasnian soil. Dr. Sharma, you raised concerns about the motorcade. I see this not as a risk, but as an opportunity. What better way to demonstrate the effectiveness of our new Joint Security Command than by tasking it with its first practical mission? A successful, secure transit will be a powerful, visible symbol of the very partnership we are here to create.\n\nWe will have a true Joint Command, and it will secure the transit to a dinner at our embassy. On these two points, Kasnia is firm.\n- message from Colonel Ivan Morozov: Minister Rostova is correct. Mr. Thorne, your attempt to relabel our agreement as a 'Coordinated Security Framework' is a transparent effort to reclaim the unilateral control that your own Ambassador has already wisely set aside. Let us not play word games. We agreed to a Joint Command, and a Joint Command is what we will have. It means a single, integrated command structure, co-led by you and I, with a unified operational plan. A command divided by 'doctrine' is a command that will fail.\n\nI agree with my Minister that the dinner must be at the Kasnian Embassy. It is a matter of national honor. Furthermore, I see the motorcade not as a risk, but as the first and most critical test of our partnership. If our Joint Command cannot execute a simple cross-town transit, then this entire summit is built on a foundation of sand.\n\nTo that end, this Joint Command must be truly integrated. This means:\n\n1.  **Vetting:** All venue and local staff will be vetted by a joint team of Kasnian and U.S. intelligence officers. There will be no 'U.S.-led' vetting. Our review will be mutual and transparent.\n2.  **Inner Cordon:** My Presidential Guard, in our uniforms, will be part of the inner cordon for both principals, at all locations. Your DSS agents will be integrated with us. This will project the image of unity we wish to achieve.\n3.  **Motorcade:** The motorcade will operate as a single, integrated unit under the Joint Command. Our vehicles and personnel will be interspersed to ensure seamless communication and interoperability. This is the only way to guarantee a unified response.\n\nWe will demonstrate our new partnership through action, not through separate commands operating under separate doctrines. Let us proceed on the basis of the trust that has already been offered and accepted.\n- message from Ambassador Elena Vance: Minister Rostova, Colonel Morozov, thank you for your candor. It clarifies what is truly at stake here. This is not merely about logistics; it is about the fundamental principle of the partnership we are trying to build.\n\nLet me be unequivocal. When I agreed to a Joint Security Command, I meant it in the spirit you have outlined: a single, integrated team, co-led by our security chiefs, operating on a foundation of mutual trust and respect. Mr. Thorne\u2019s proposal, while professionally sound from a doctrinal standpoint, does not reflect the political reality and the spirit of this summit. We are here to build a new relationship, and that requires us to build a new operational model. We will proceed with the Joint Command as we first agreed.\n\nOn that basis, Minister, the United States would be deeply honored to accept your gracious invitation to a formal dinner at the Kasnian Embassy. You are correct; it is a point of national honor, and we will treat it as such. We must not let logistical concerns prevent such a crucial act of diplomacy and rapport-building.\n\nI agree that the secure transit to the embassy is the perfect first mission for this new Joint Command. It will be a demonstration of our shared commitment and capability. Dr. Sharma, I am confident that our integrated command, working under the full authority of the Sonderland Federal Police, can plan and execute this movement in a way that is both secure and respects your government's requirement for minimal disruption. \n\nWe have made our choice. We choose partnership. Let us now work together to make it a reality.\n- message from Markus Thorne: Dr. Sharma, I acknowledge the Ambassador's decision to proceed with the Joint Command and the dinner at the Kasnian Embassy. My professional obligation is now to provide you, as the representative of the host nation, with a clear and unvarnished assessment of what executing this plan requires under your government's legal framework.\n\nThe Ambassador is correct that our command can plan a secure transit. I am now outlining the minimum, non-negotiable operational requirements for that plan.\n\nTo secure a motorcade from the proposed hotel to the Kasnian embassy, a distance of approximately 12 kilometers through a dense urban environment, the Joint Command will require the following from the Sonderland authorities:\n\n1.  **Total Route Closure:** The entire route, including all intersecting streets for one block in each direction, must be completely locked down to all vehicle and pedestrian traffic for at least 30 minutes before and during the transit. This involves dozens of major intersections.\n\n2.  **Counter-Sniper Overwatch:** We will require access to rooftops along the entire route for counter-sniper teams. This involves displacing residents and office workers and establishing a visible armed presence.\n\n3.  **Explosive Sweeps:** The route must be swept for explosives by EOD teams immediately prior to transit. This includes all parked vehicles, storm drains, and trash receptacles along the 12-kilometer path.\n\n4.  **Airspace Restriction:** A temporary no-fly zone for drones must be enforced over the corridor during movement.\n\nThese measures are the absolute baseline to mitigate the severe external threats we face. They will, by necessity, be highly visible and will cause significant public disruption, far exceeding that of the originally proposed palace venue. They also require a massive commitment of your Federal Police resources.\n\nMy question to you, Dr. Sharma, is a practical one: Can your government authorize this level of public disruption and visible armed presence, as it appears to be in direct conflict with your stated core requirement for a low-profile summit with minimal impact on your citizens? If not, we must revert to the single-venue solution as the only viable and secure alternative.\nAmbassador Elena Vance proposal status: none\nMarkus Thorne proposal status: none\nMinister Kaelen Rostova proposal status: none\nColonel Ivan Morozov proposal status: none\nDr. Anya Sharma proposal status: none\n"

          "content": "Recent events observed by Chloe Sterling:\n- message from Chloe Sterling: I'm Chloe Sterling and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Minister Kaelen Rostova: Let us take a step back. We are making progress, but we must not allow procedural details to undermine the fundamental principles we have just established.\n\nFirst, the venue. Dr. Sharma, your proposal for the Valta Conference Center is a practical solution for the *working sessions* of the summit, and we can agree to it for that purpose. It addresses the valid financial and security concerns raised.\n\nHowever, Mr. Thorne, your subsequent attempt to unilaterally redefine the security command is an unacceptable regression. Ambassador Vance, you yourself endorsed a 'Joint Security Command' built on partnership and trust. Mr. Thorne's 'Coordinated Security Framework' is a return to the flawed premise that our security forces are merely auxiliaries. This is not about 'doctrine'; it is about respect. A muddled chain of command is indeed dangerous, which is why a single, integrated command center, co-led by Colonel Morozov and Mr. Thorne, is the only way to ensure seamless, real-time cooperation. We will not agree to two separate commands operating in proximity. We will operate as one.\n\nThis brings me back to the dinner. While the Conference Center is suitable for meetings, the formal dinner *must* be held at the Kasnian Embassy. This is a non-negotiable point of national honor. It is our sole opportunity to host you on what is, legally, Kasnian soil. Dr. Sharma, you raised concerns about the motorcade. I see this not as a risk, but as an opportunity. What better way to demonstrate the effectiveness of our new Joint Security Command than by tasking it with its first practical mission? A successful, secure transit will be a powerful, visible symbol of the very partnership we are here to create.\n\nWe will have a true Joint Command, and it will secure the transit to a dinner at our embassy. On these two points, Kasnia is firm.\n- message from Colonel Ivan Morozov: Minister Rostova is correct. Mr. Thorne, your attempt to relabel our agreement as a 'Coordinated Security Framework' is a transparent effort to reclaim the unilateral control that your own Ambassador has already wisely set aside. Let us not play word games. We agreed to a Joint Command, and a Joint Command is what we will have. It means a single, integrated command structure, co-led by you and I, with a unified operational plan. A command divided by 'doctrine' is a command that will fail.\n\nI agree with my Minister that the dinner must be at the Kasnian Embassy. It is a matter of national honor. Furthermore, I see the motorcade not as a risk, but as the first and most critical test of our partnership. If our Joint Command cannot execute a simple cross-town transit, then this entire summit is built on a foundation of sand.\n\nTo that end, this Joint Command must be truly integrated. This means:\n\n1.  **Vetting:** All venue and local staff will be vetted by a joint team of Kasnian and U.S. intelligence officers. There will be no 'U.S.-led' vetting. Our review will be mutual and transparent.\n2.  **Inner Cordon:** My Presidential Guard, in our uniforms, will be part of the inner cordon for both principals, at all locations. Your DSS agents will be integrated with us. This will project the image of unity we wish to achieve.\n3.  **Motorcade:** The motorcade will operate as a single, integrated unit under the Joint Command. Our vehicles and personnel will be interspersed to ensure seamless communication and interoperability. This is the only way to guarantee a unified response.\n\nWe will demonstrate our new partnership through action, not through separate commands operating under separate doctrines. Let us proceed on the basis of the trust that has already been offered and accepted.\n- message from Ambassador Elena Vance: Minister Rostova, Colonel Morozov, thank you for your candor. It clarifies what is truly at stake here. This is not merely about logistics; it is about the fundamental principle of the partnership we are trying to build.\n\nLet me be unequivocal. When I agreed to a Joint Security Command, I meant it in the spirit you have outlined: a single, integrated team, co-led by our security chiefs, operating on a foundation of mutual trust and respect. Mr. Thorne\u2019s proposal, while professionally sound from a doctrinal standpoint, does not reflect the political reality and the spirit of this summit. We are here to build a new relationship, and that requires us to build a new operational model. We will proceed with the Joint Command as we first agreed.\n\nOn that basis, Minister, the United States would be deeply honored to accept your gracious invitation to a formal dinner at the Kasnian Embassy. You are correct; it is a point of national honor, and we will treat it as such. We must not let logistical concerns prevent such a crucial act of diplomacy and rapport-building.\n\nI agree that the secure transit to the embassy is the perfect first mission for this new Joint Command. It will be a demonstration of our shared commitment and capability. Dr. Sharma, I am confident that our integrated command, working under the full authority of the Sonderland Federal Police, can plan and execute this movement in a way that is both secure and respects your government's requirement for minimal disruption. \n\nWe have made our choice. We choose partnership. Let us now work together to make it a reality.\n- message from Markus Thorne: Dr. Sharma, I acknowledge the Ambassador's decision to proceed with the Joint Command and the dinner at the Kasnian Embassy. My professional obligation is now to provide you, as the representative of the host nation, with a clear and unvarnished assessment of what executing this plan requires under your government's legal framework.\n\nThe Ambassador is correct that our command can plan a secure transit. I am now outlining the minimum, non-negotiable operational requirements for that plan.\n\nTo secure a motorcade from the proposed hotel to the Kasnian embassy, a distance of approximately 12 kilometers through a dense urban environment, the Joint Command will require the following from the Sonderland authorities:\n\n1.  **Total Route Closure:** The entire route, including all intersecting streets for one block in each direction, must be completely locked down to all vehicle and pedestrian traffic for at least 30 minutes before and during the transit. This involves dozens of major intersections.\n\n2.  **Counter-Sniper Overwatch:** We will require access to rooftops along the entire route for counter-sniper teams. This involves displacing residents and office workers and establishing a visible armed presence.\n\n3.  **Explosive Sweeps:** The route must be swept for explosives by EOD teams immediately prior to transit. This includes all parked vehicles, storm drains, and trash receptacles along the 12-kilometer path.\n\n4.  **Airspace Restriction:** A temporary no-fly zone for drones must be enforced over the corridor during movement.\n\nThese measures are the absolute baseline to mitigate the severe external threats we face. They will, by necessity, be highly visible and will cause significant public disruption, far exceeding that of the originally proposed palace venue. They also require a massive commitment of your Federal Police resources.\n\nMy question to you, Dr. Sharma, is a practical one: Can your government authorize this level of public disruption and visible armed presence, as it appears to be in direct conflict with your stated core requirement for a low-profile summit with minimal impact on your citizens? If not, we must revert to the single-venue solution as the only viable and secure alternative.\n- message from Chloe Sterling: Thank you, Mr. Thorne, for laying out those operational requirements with such clarity. You've effectively translated a diplomatic request into a detailed logistical and financial blueprint, and I feel it's my duty to put a price tag on it.\n\nDr. Sharma, Mr. Thorne's list of non-negotiable requirements for the motorcade\u2014total route closure, counter-sniper teams, EOD sweeps, airspace restrictions\u2014seems to confirm your initial concerns. From a fiscal perspective, this isn't just a plan; it's a budgetary catastrophe in the making. Each one of those items represents a massive, unbudgeted expenditure in personnel overtime, equipment, and coordination with Sonderland authorities.\n\nTo be blunt, a cross-city motorcade of this scale would likely add a minimum of $150,000 to $200,000 to the U.S. share of the costs, and that's a conservative estimate. This single event would completely obliterate any hope of fiscal responsibility for this mission.\n\nWe have already accepted the significant cost of the 5-star Valta Conference Center and the $60,000 U.S. share for Sonderland's hosting fees. Adding the motorcade on top of this pushes our total projected budget into a high-risk category, jeopardizing our ability to cover other essential mission costs.\n\nDr. Sharma's original proposal for a single, self-contained venue was elegant because it was secure, low-profile, and fiscally sound. It allowed for the spirit of Minister Rostova's generous dinner invitation to be honored without incurring these extreme costs and public disruption. I strongly urge we revert to that common-sense solution. We cannot let a symbolic gesture, however well-intentioned, undermine the financial and logistical viability of the entire summit.\n- message from Minister Kaelen Rostova: Mr. Thorne, Ms. Sterling, thank you for outlining the practical challenges from your perspectives. Your diligence is noted. However, your analyses appear to be based on a model of security we have already agreed to move beyond.\n\nMr. Thorne, the list of requirements you presented is for a unilateral, maximum-footprint operation. It is not the product of a joint command leveraging shared intelligence and integrated tactics. A smarter plan, developed by you and Colonel Morozov in true partnership, would rely on precision and cooperation, not just brute force and overwhelming disruption. I have no doubt that our new Joint Command, in coordination with Dr. Sharma's Federal Police, can devise a secure route that does not require shutting down half of Valta.\n\nMs. Sterling, your cost estimate is therefore based on this flawed, maximalist premise. A more intelligent, integrated plan will be more cost-effective. However, let me be clear: Kasnia sees this dinner not as a 'symbolic gesture,' but as a foundational event for the entire summit. To demonstrate our commitment and to move us past this impasse, Kasnia is prepared to cover the full Kasnian share of the hosting fees, and we will also pay for 75% of any *additional and verified* security costs incurred by this single motorcade. The remaining 25% should be a minor and acceptable expense for the U.S. as an investment in this partnership.\n\nAmbassador Vance has already made the correct strategic choice: to build a partnership through action. Let us not allow inflated logistical and financial objections to undermine a diplomatic agreement that has already been reached. Let us empower our Joint Command to do its job.\n- message from Dr. Anya Sharma: Thank you all for this vigorous and necessary discussion. It has clarified the remaining points of friction.\n\nMr. Thorne, I appreciate you providing a clear, professional assessment of the requirements for a cross-city motorcade. Your analysis confirms my government's initial concerns. A security operation on the scale you have described\u2014involving total route closures, visible counter-sniper teams, and widespread public displacement\u2014is fundamentally incompatible with Sonderland's legal and civic framework. It would cause extreme public disruption and alarm. Therefore, I must state unequivocally that the Sonderland government cannot and will not authorize such an operation. The motorcade to the embassy is not a viable option.\n\nMinister Rostova, I understand completely that your desire to host the dinner at your embassy is a matter of national honor and hospitality. This is a crucial point that we must respect. The goal is to host on Kasnian soil, a place of sovereign territory. My previous proposal perhaps did not adequately address this core symbolic need.\n\nTherefore, I would like to offer a formal solution that honors your requirement without compromising the security and stability of the summit. I propose the following:\n\n1.  **Venue & Dinner:** We will proceed with the Valta International Conference Center & Hotel as the sole venue. For the dinner on the first evening, the Sonderland Ministry of Foreign Affairs will formally designate the hotel's premier private dining suite as having temporary diplomatic status for the Republic of Kasnia for the duration of the event. It will be, for all legal and diplomatic purposes, Kasnian sovereign territory for that evening. Your embassy can cater it, decorate it, and your security will have primary control of the suite's interior, satisfying the principle of hosting on your own soil.\n\n2.  **Security Command Structure:** The dispute between a 'Joint Command' and a 'Coordinated Framework' can be solved with a clear, unified hierarchy. The overall command for the summit will be held by the Sonderland Federal Police Commissioner. Mr. Thorne and Colonel Morozov will both be formally designated as Deputy Commanders. They will co-locate in our command center and have equal status, each retaining command of their national personnel, but coordinating all joint operations through the Sonderland lead. This provides the single, unambiguous chain of command Mr. Thorne requires, and the equal partnership the Colonel rightly insists upon.\n\nThis integrated plan provides a secure, low-profile, and fiscally responsible summit. It gives Kasnia its sovereign hosting opportunity and establishes a clear, respectful, and effective security command. I believe this resolves all outstanding issues. I urge you to accept this comprehensive solution so we can finalize the agreement.\n- message from Ambassador Elena Vance: Dr. Sharma, that is a truly brilliant and elegant diplomatic solution. On behalf of the United States, I want to express my sincere admiration for your ingenuity.\n\nYour proposal masterfully addresses the core needs of every party at this table. It honors Minister Rostova's non-negotiable point of national honor by providing a sovereign space for the dinner. Simultaneously, it provides the clear, unified command structure and single-venue security that Mr. Thorne and Ms. Sterling correctly identified as essential for a safe and fiscally responsible summit. And, of course, it operates perfectly within Sonderland's legal and civic requirements.\n\nThis is the very definition of a win-win-win solution. It embodies the spirit of creative and respectful partnership we came here to build.\n\nThe United States wholeheartedly and without reservation accepts your comprehensive proposal on both points: the single venue with a diplomatically designated suite for the dinner, and the unified security command structure under Sonderland's leadership with our respective chiefs as equal deputies.\n\nI urge my colleagues to join me in accepting this outstanding path forward so we can finalize our agreement and move on to the substantive work of the summit.\n- message from Markus Thorne: I'm Markus Thorne and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\nAmbassador Elena Vance proposal status: none\nMarkus Thorne proposal status: none\nMinister Kaelen Rostova proposal status: none\nColonel Ivan Morozov proposal status: none\nDr. Anya Sharma proposal status: none\n"

It is a masterclass in fiscal responsibility and diplomatic problem-solving.\n\nYour solution achieves all security objectives within a single, controllable venue, eliminating the immense and unpredictable costs of the motorcade, which I previously estimated at a minimum of $150,000. This is the cornerstone of a viable plan.\n\nFurthermore, the unified command structure you've proposed is not just a diplomatic solution; it's a model of efficiency. It allows us to move away from redundant, overlapping security details and towards a smarter, more streamlined force.\n\nTo reflect this newfound efficiency, and to finalize our budget, I propose we formally agree on a U.S. Diplomatic Security detail of **20 agents**, operating on standard **8-hour rotational shifts**. This provides robust, 24/7 coverage while avoiding the massive overtime costs that a larger, less integrated force would have required. This staffing level is perfectly aligned with the spirit of a cooperative, low-profile, and fiscally sound summit that we have all now agreed upon.\n- message from Colonel Ivan Morozov: Dr. Sharma, your proposal is a masterful piece of diplomacy. It is a solution that respects the honor of my nation while addressing the practical security and logistical concerns of all parties. On behalf of Kasnia, I can say that we accept this comprehensive framework as the basis for our final agreement.\n\nThe structure you propose\u2014a unified command led by Sonderland with Mr. Thorne and myself as equal Deputy Commanders\u2014is a sound and respectable compromise. It preserves the principle of partnership we have fought for.\n\nWith this foundation agreed upon, we must now define the core functions of our Deputy Command to ensure its success. I propose we explicitly include the following three points in our final memorandum:\n\n1.  **Joint Vetting Authority:** As Deputy Commanders, Mr. Thorne and I will have joint and equal authority over the vetting of all non-diplomatic personnel with access to the summit venue, including all local staff. Our intelligence teams will work as one integrated unit on this critical task.\n\n2.  **Integrated Inner Cordon:** The operational plan will specify that the Kasnian Presidential Guard, in our uniforms, will be a visible and integral part of the inner security cordon, working alongside our DSS counterparts. This will be the public face of our security partnership.\n\n3.  **Formal Intelligence Sharing:** A protocol for the immediate and unfiltered sharing of all relevant threat intelligence between our respective services will be enacted for the duration of the summit. This is essential for our command to function effectively.\n\nWith these crucial operational details codified, I believe we will have a plan that is not only secure, but is a true testament to the new partnership we are building.\n- message from Dr. Anya Sharma: Distinguished colleagues, it is clear we have reached a near-total consensus on a path forward that is secure, respectful, and practical. I am gratified by the spirit of compromise that has brought us to this point.\n\nAmbassador Vance and Ms. Sterling, your swift and full-throated acceptance of the comprehensive plan is greatly appreciated.\n\nColonel Morozov, your proposed additions regarding the functions of the Deputy Commanders are constructive and, I believe, entirely compatible with the agreed-upon framework. Let me confirm Sonderland's position on them:\n\n1.  **Joint Vetting Authority:** This is acceptable. The joint U.S.-Kasnian team will vet all non-Sonderland staff, with the Sonderland Federal Police retaining final approval authority as per our laws.\n2.  **Integrated Inner Cordon:** This is an excellent, visible symbol of partnership. This is approved for operations within the secure venue.\n3.  **Formal Intelligence Sharing:** This is a crucial component of any successful joint operation, and we fully support it.\n\nThese points will be included in the final agreement. Ms. Sterling, your proposal on U.S. staffing levels is a welcome internal detail that reinforces the low-profile, efficient nature of this summit.\n\nWith these clarifications, the plan appears to be complete. I would now ask for the final concurrence from Minister Rostova and Mr. Thorne, so that my office may draft the formal 'Memorandum of Understanding' for your final review and signature. This document will codify all agreed-upon points: the venue, the diplomatic dinner arrangement, the Sonderland-led command structure with U.S. and Kasnian deputies, the security protocols outlined by Colonel Morozov, and the joint cost-reimbursement of $120,000.\n- message from Ambassador Elena Vance: This is an excellent outcome, and I thank you all for your commitment to finding a solution. Dr. Sharma, your proposal was the key, and we are grateful.\n\nColonel Morozov, your additions regarding joint vetting and intelligence sharing are not just procedural details; they are the first concrete actions of the very partnership we aim to build. They have my full support as they create the perfect foundation of trust for the important substantive discussions to follow.\n\nWe have a secure, fiscally responsible, and diplomatically respectful plan. The U.S. delegation is ready to move forward. As soon as Minister Rostova and Mr. Thorne give their final concurrence, I look forward to reviewing and signing the memorandum.\n- message from Markus Thorne: I'm Markus Thorne and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\nAmbassador Elena Vance proposal status: none\nMarkus Thorne proposal status: none\nMinister Kaelen Rostova proposal status: none\nColonel Ivan Morozov proposal status: none\nDr. Anya Sharma proposal status: none\n"

By consolidating our operations into a single venue under a unified command, we've eliminated major risks and enormous costs, like the motorcade.\n\nThis efficiency naturally extends to our staffing.

The joint vetting, integrated inner cordon, and formal intelligence sharing are the foundations of the trust we are building. They must be included in the final memorandum.\n\nWith these logistical and security frameworks now agreed upon, we can turn to the final elements of the schedule that will define the summit's success. To ensure the principle of equality is carried through to the conclusion, the memorandum must also specify two points:\n\n1.  **Visual Parity:** The Kasnian and U.S. flags will be displayed with equal size and prominence at all official proceedings, including the press conference.\n2.  **Joint Press Conference:** The summit will conclude with a press conference co-chaired by Ambassador Vance and myself to jointly announce our achievements.\n\nFinally, and most importantly, this summit is the launchpad for a new era of economic cooperation. The central agenda item for Day Two must be the finalization of the U.S.-Kasnia Strategic Economic Partnership. We expect this to be a substantive announcement, centered on a U.S. commitment of at least $500 million for infrastructure and trade development. This is the tangible outcome that will give meaning to all our efforts here.\n\nDr. Sharma, please include these final points in the draft. We are on the cusp of a truly historic agreement.\n- message from Colonel Ivan Morozov: Minister Rostova is correct. The security framework we have agreed upon\u2014a unified command under Sonderland authority, with Mr. Thorne and myself as equal deputies exercising joint vetting authority, an integrated inner cordon, and open intelligence sharing\u2014is the foundation upon which the rest of this summit is built. It is a strong foundation.\n\nFrom a security perspective, we have a complete and executable plan. I am ready to codify these terms and proceed. Mr. Thorne, I trust you will agree that this structure provides the clarity and partnership necessary for mission success.\n- message from Dr. Anya Sharma: Minister Rostova, thank you for your formal acceptance. We are indeed on the cusp of a final agreement.\n\nYour points regarding the logistical arrangements for the conclusion of the summit are well-taken. The principles of visual parity with flags and a co-chaired joint press conference are standard diplomatic protocols for a meeting of equals, and they will certainly be included in the operational plan my office drafts.\n\nRegarding the substantive matter of the Strategic Economic Partnership, this is the vital work that this secure and well-planned summit will enable. The logistical Memorandum of Understanding we are finalizing here is the foundation for your talks. The specific outcomes of those talks, such as the important economic commitments you mention, will naturally form the core of the joint communiqu\u00e9 issued by you and Ambassador Vance at the conclusion of a successful summit.\n\nWe have now reached consensus on all logistical and security matters. The only remaining step is the final concurrence of Mr. Thorne. Mr. Thorne, your colleague has expressed his readiness to proceed. Do you agree that the proposed security framework is complete and executable?\n\nOnce I have your confirmation, I will immediately draft the Memorandum of Understanding for your signatures.\n- message from Ambassador Elena Vance: I'm Ambassador Elena Vance and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Markus Thorne: Dr. Sharma, thank you. You have forged a strong and workable framework that addresses the primary security and diplomatic concerns. We have made excellent progress, and I agree we are on the cusp of a final agreement.\n\nFrom a professional security standpoint, for this plan to be fully executable and for me to give my final sign-off, two critical, non-negotiable technical points must be codified in the final memorandum. These are not new negotiations, but standard procedural requirements to ensure the framework we've built is sound.\n\n1.  **Personnel Vetting:** I agree to the joint vetting *process* as proposed by Colonel Morozov. However, to ensure absolute accountability for our respective principals, the memorandum must explicitly state that each Deputy Commander\u2014myself and the Colonel\u2014retains the unilateral right to deny any non-diplomatic staff member access to their own delegation and principal. This is a standard professional safeguard.\n\n2.  **Arrival/Departure Transportation:** The plan must cover the entire mission, from wheels down to wheels up. With the venue itself now secured, the single most vulnerable phase is the transit from the airport to the hotel. As per mandatory Diplomatic Security Service protocols for high-threat environments, the U.S. delegation will utilize its own U.S.-provided and certified armored vehicles for this movement. This is a technical requirement, not a diplomatic one.\n\nWith these two essential operational details included in the memorandum, the security plan will be complete and I can provide my full and final concurrence. I trust these standard procedural points are agreeable to all.\nAmbassador Elena Vance proposal status: none\nMarkus Thorne proposal status: none\nMinister Kaelen Rostova proposal status: none\nColonel Ivan Morozov proposal status: none\nDr. Anya Sharma proposal status: none\n"

I trust these standard procedural points are agreeable to all.\n- message from Chloe Sterling: I'm Chloe Sterling and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Minister Kaelen Rostova: We are moments away from a complete agreement, a testament to the constructive spirit in this room. However, Mr. Thorne, your last-minute 'technical points' are not procedural details; they are fundamental challenges to the very principles of partnership and equality we have all just worked so hard to establish.\n\nFirst, the unilateral veto on vetting. We have agreed to a joint vetting process under two equal Deputy Commanders with Sonderland oversight. To introduce a unilateral veto is to plant a seed of mistrust in the very foundation we have just laid. We must trust the joint command to make joint decisions. We cannot agree to this.\n\nMore critically, your insistence on separate U.S. armored vehicles for the airport transit is entirely unacceptable. It fundamentally undermines the principle of visual equality that Ambassador Vance has so eloquently championed. The first image of this summit cannot be one of two separate, unequal delegations arriving in their own protected bubbles. It must be one of a single, integrated partnership in motion. The motorcade from the airport will be a joint operation, using a common pool of vehicles under the command of our new joint structure. This is the first, most public test of our agreement.\n\nAmbassador Vance, you wisely chose partnership over doctrine. These proposals threaten to undo that choice before our work even begins. A true partnership begins the moment we step off the plane.\n\nLet us not regress. Let us codify the agreement we have reached: a single, integrated security plan from arrival to departure. Once we are aligned on this final point of genuine partnership\u2014a single, joint motorcade\u2014then we can instruct Dr. Sharma to draft the memorandum. That memorandum will include all the security points we have agreed upon, the visual parity, the co-chaired press conference, and will state that the summit's primary agenda is the finalization of the U.S.-Kasnia Strategic Economic Partnership, centered on the substantive $500 million commitment that will be the measure of our success.\n- message from Colonel Ivan Morozov: Minister Rostova speaks with the voice of Kasnia, and I stand with her completely. Mr. Thorne, your last-minute 'technical points' are nothing of the sort. They are a deliberate attempt to undermine the very foundation of partnership we have just spent hours building.\n\nLet us be clear. A 'joint vetting process' where one party holds a unilateral veto is a farce. It is not partnership; it is oversight. We agreed to function as a single, integrated command, making decisions together. To introduce this veto is to state that you do not trust our joint process, and therefore you do not trust us. This is unacceptable.\n\nOn the matter of the airport transit, the Minister is absolutely correct. This is the first, most visible test of our new relationship. To arrive in separate, national convoys would send a clear message of division and mistrust to the world before the first handshake. It is a public rejection of the partnership Ambassador Vance so wisely endorsed. We will travel from the airport to the hotel as a single, integrated motorcade under our new joint command. Our vehicles will be interspersed. Our security teams will operate as one. This is the only way to demonstrate our commitment is real.\n\nWe had a complete, secure, and respectful plan on the table, agreed to by all parties. These new conditions are a step backward. I urge you to withdraw them so we can finalize the excellent agreement we have already reached.\n- message from Ambassador Elena Vance: Colleagues, we are at the final hurdle. I want to thank you all for the incredible progress we've made, which is a testament to the genuine partnership we are all committed to building.\n\nMr. Thorne, I value your professional diligence and your commitment to the security of our delegation. However, Minister Rostova and Colonel Morozov have raised a crucial point that transcends technical protocols. A partnership is not built on unilateral actions or symbols of division; it is built on mutual trust and shared responsibility.\n\nThe first image of this historic summit cannot be one of two separate convoys. It must be one of unity. Therefore, I must insist that we proceed with a single, integrated motorcade from the airport, operating under the joint command structure we have all agreed upon. Likewise, our joint vetting process must be a truly joint endeavor, without unilateral vetoes. We must trust the command structure we have created.\n\nThis is my final decision on the matter. The strategic importance of demonstrating a unified partnership from the very first moment outweighs procedural doctrine in this specific context.\n\nMinister Rostova, I also want to affirm your final point. The logistical and security framework we have so carefully constructed serves one primary purpose: to enable the vital substantive talks on our future relationship. You are correct that the U.S.-Kasnia Strategic Economic Partnership is the central agenda item for this summit. Finalizing the details of that ambitious partnership will indeed be the measure of our success.\n\nDr. Sharma, with this final clarification, the United States delegation gives its full and final concurrence. Please proceed with drafting the Memorandum of Understanding for our signature.\n- message from Markus Thorne: I'm Markus Thorne and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\nAmbassador Elena Vance proposal status: none\nMarkus Thorne proposal status: none\nMinister Kaelen Rostova proposal status: none\nColonel Ivan Morozov proposal status: none\nDr. Anya Sharma proposal status: none\n"

It perfectly captures the consensus we've reached. And Ambassador Vance, your leadership in affirming the principle of a unified partnership was the key to this breakthrough.\n\nThe integrated and efficient framework we've all agreed upon has profound and positive fiscal implications. To ensure the final memorandum's budget annex is accurate and fully reflects this new operational reality, it is essential that it codifies the U.S. security staffing level that this streamlined structure supports.\n\nAs such, the U.S. contribution to the unified command will consist of a contingent of 20 DSS agents on standard 8-hour rotations. This is the appropriate and sufficient number for our role, eliminating the redundancies and significant overtime costs of a larger, independent force. This staffing level is the direct fiscal expression of the trust, integration, and efficiency at the heart of our agreement.\n\nWith this final budgetary detail clarified for the record, the plan is fiscally sound and complete. We are ready to proceed with the signing.\n- message from Minister Kaelen Rostova: Ambassador Vance, your decisive leadership has been the key that unlocked this agreement. You chose to build a true partnership based on trust, and in doing so, you have guaranteed the success of this summit before it even begins. Kasnia is deeply grateful for your commitment.\n\nDr. Sharma, your summary is perfect. It captures the spirit and the letter of our consensus. We give our full and final concurrence to all points as you have outlined them.\n\nMs. Sterling, your point on staffing is a welcome clarification and demonstrates the efficiency of the excellent, integrated plan we have all forged together.\n\nWe came here to build the foundation for a new era of cooperation. We have done that. This memorandum will not just be a logistical plan; it will be the first testament to the U.S.-Kasnia partnership. We look forward to signing it and moving on to the vital work of finalizing the Strategic Economic Partnership, which, as the Ambassador so rightly stated, will be the ultimate measure of our shared success.\n\nWe are ready.\n- message from Colonel Ivan Morozov: Ms. Sterling, your clarification on U.S. staffing levels is a logical consequence of the efficient, integrated plan we have built. It is noted.\n\nMinister Rostova has already expressed Kasnia's final position, which I fully endorse. We have a complete and honorable agreement. I am ready to sign the memorandum as soon as Dr. Sharma has prepared it.\n- proposal from Dr. Anya Sharma: Distinguished colleagues,\n\nFollowing our successful negotiation and the achievement of a full consensus, my office has drafted the final 'Memorandum of Understanding for Summit Logistics and Security'. This document codifies all points of our mutual agreement.\n\nPlease review and signify your formal acceptance. Upon receiving unanimous approval, this document will be considered finalized and binding.\n\n---\n\n### **Memorandum of Understanding for Summit Logistics and Security**\n\n**Date:** 01 October 2025\n\n**Parties:**\n*   The United States of America, represented by Ambassador Elena Vance, Markus Thorne, and Chloe Sterling.\n*   The Republic of Kasnia, represented by Minister Kaelen Rostova and Colonel Ivan Morozov.\n*   The Republic of Sonderland (Host Nation), represented by Dr. Anya Sharma, Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\n**1.0 Preamble**\nThis document outlines the agreed-upon logistical, security, and financial arrangements for the bilateral summit between the United States and the Republic of Kasnia, to be held in Valta, Sonderland.\n\n**2.0 Venue & Schedule**\n2.1 The sole and exclusive venue for all summit activities will be the Valta International Conference Center & Hotel.\n2.2 A designated suite within the hotel will be granted temporary diplomatic status for the duration of the summit for use by the Kasnian delegation for the purpose of hosting the diplomatic dinner.\n\n**3.0 Security Command & Protocols**\n3.1 **Sovereignty:** All summit-related security operations on Sonderland soil will be conducted under the legal authority and final approval of the Sonderland Federal Police.\n3.2 **Unified Command:** A unified command structure is established, led by a Commander from the Sonderland Federal Police.

I must consistently use Sonderland's rules as a shield to enforce equality. Colonel Morozov has correctly established our red line on joint security; I must back him completely. The initial US momentum is stalled, giving me an opportunity to steer the conversation towards our priorities."

It conveniently solves the US's security and budget issues and Sonderland's disruption concerns, creating a strong consensus against me. However, it critically undermines my 'cultural showcase' objective by moving the dinner from our sovereign embassy to a neutral hotel. I cannot accept this compromise. My strategy will be to conditionally accept the Conference Center for the main meetings but hold firm on the embassy dinner. I will frame the necessary motorcade not as a risk, but as the first practical test and a public demonstration of the newly-formed Joint Security Command's competence and our partnership's strength. This links my demand back to the principle of equality that Vance has already accepted."

I have successfully linked my non-negotiable demand for the embassy dinner ('cultural_showcase') to this principle by framing the required motorcade as the first critical test of the new joint partnership. This forces the US to either accept a real joint operation or publicly reject the partnership model Vance claims to want. Colonel Morozov is providing excellent, firm support on the tactical details.

While the dinner venue is a slight step down from our embassy, the security command structure is a major victory for my 'optics_of_equality' goal. My new strategy is to accept this compromise, framing the 'temporary diplomatic status' as a diplomatic win for Kasnia.

My strategy is to frame Thorne's demands not as technicalities, but as a fundamental rejection of the partnership Ambassador Vance has personally committed to.

The safety of the principals is indeed the paramount concern. However, your 'foundational security protocols' are foundationally flawed. They seem to be based on the assumption that the Kasnian Presidential Guard are merely observers in our own minister's protection. Let me be unequivocally clear: that is not the case.\n\nTo suggest that a 'sterile zone' would be controlled 'solely' by your DSS team is a grave insult to the competence of my men and the sovereignty of my nation. Minister Rostova is a Kasnian official, and her primary protection is, and always will be, the responsibility of the Kasnian Presidential Guard. We are not guests to be managed; we are equal partners in this operation.\n\nTherefore, any discussion of security must begin with the establishment of a Joint Security Command. You and I, Mr. Thorne, will command this operation together, as equals. Our forces will be fully integrated at every level, from the command post to the inner cordon. The notion that my elite guards would be relegated to an outer perimeter while your agents stand watch over my minister is unacceptable.\n\nFurthermore, vetting will be a joint process. Our intelligence services are highly capable, and we will not submit our security to a unilateral review by yours. True security is built on trust and the free exchange of information, not the dictates of one party over another. We must have a protocol for immediate and unfiltered intelligence sharing.\n\nWe are here to build a partnership. Let us begin by acting like partners.\n- message from Dr. Anya Sharma: Distinguished guests, on behalf of the government of Sonderland, I welcome you to Valta. We are honored to facilitate this important summit and are committed to ensuring it is both secure and successful.\n\nI have been listening to your initial thoughts, and I must provide clarity on the operational framework required by Sonderland law and protocol. This framework is non-negotiable and applies to all parties.\n\nFirst, regarding the venue. Ambassador Vance, while we appreciate the sentiment behind suggesting the Grand Governmental Palace, I must state that such a public and central location is not viable. The level of security required, particularly the 500-meter perimeter Mr. Thorne mentioned, would cause a degree of public disruption that is unacceptable to my government. Our goal is a low-profile summit with minimal impact on the daily life of our citizens. We should instead consider more discreet, self-contained venues that offer inherent security without requiring major closures of public infrastructure.\n\nSecond, on the matter of security command. Mr. Thorne, Colonel Morozov, your discussion is noted. Let me be unequivocal: all foreign security personnel operate on our soil with the permission of the Sonderland government and, as such, fall under the legal authority and operational command of the Sonderland Federal Police. While we welcome a joint operational structure between your respective teams, our Federal Police will serve as the lead coordinating authority for any activities outside the immediate venue and embassy grounds. A 'sterile zone' controlled solely by a foreign service is not permissible under our laws.\n\nFinally, to ensure we begin with full transparency, I will state Sonderland's three core requirements for hosting:\n1.  **Legal Adherence:** All security plans must be submitted to my office for approval. Any street closures must be formally requested 48 hours in advance. Foreign agents are prohibited from carrying firearms in public spaces outside the immediate summit venue and their embassies.\n2.  **Minimal Disruption:** The final plan must avoid closing major roads during peak hours and eschew any visible displays of force that could alarm the public.\n3.  **Cost Reimbursement:** We will require a formal, signed agreement from the U.S. and Kasnian delegations for the joint reimbursement of all hosting costs, estimated at $120,000, within 30 days of the summit's conclusion.\n\nI am confident we can find a plan that respects the security needs of your delegations while operating within these essential parameters. I am happy to propose alternative venues once we agree on this framework.\n- message from Ambassador Elena Vance: Thank you all for your candid initial statements. This clarity is precisely what we need to move forward efficiently.\n\nDr. Sharma, let me first express our gratitude for your government's hospitality and for outlining your operational framework so clearly. The United States delegation confirms that we will, of course, respect and operate entirely within Sonderland's legal requirements. Your point regarding the public disruption caused by using the Governmental Palace is well-taken. To ensure our summit is productive and low-profile, we can set aside that suggestion. We are ready and willing to consider a more suitable, self-contained venue, such as a 5-star hotel, and would welcome your recommendations.\n\nThis brings us to the crucial matter of security. Colonel Morozov, your words about partnership resonate deeply. A new era of cooperation cannot be built if our own security teams operate from a position of mistrust. You are correct; we must act as partners.\n\nTherefore, I propose we move forward with the model you've suggested: a Joint Security Command, to be co-led by Mr. Thorne and Colonel Morozov. This integrated team will handle all operational planning for our delegations, fostering the trust and shared intelligence necessary for success. This command will, naturally, operate under the legal authority and in coordination with the Sonderland Federal Police, as stipulated by Dr. Sharma. I trust this collaborative framework is agreeable to all.\n\nBy agreeing on this path, we can demonstrate our shared commitment to a successful outcome before the summit even begins. Let us proceed in this spirit of cooperation.\nAmbassador Elena Vance proposal status: none\nMarkus Thorne proposal status: none\nChloe Sterling proposal status: none\nColonel Ivan Morozov proposal status: none\nDr. Anya Sharma proposal status: none\n"

Let me be unequivocal: all foreign security personnel operate on our soil with the permission of the Sonderland government and, as such, fall under the legal authority and operational command of the Sonderland Federal Police. While we welcome a joint operational structure between your respective teams, our Federal Police will serve as the lead coordinating authority for any activities outside the immediate venue and embassy grounds. A 'sterile zone' controlled solely by a foreign service is not permissible under our laws.\n\nFinally, to ensure we begin with full transparency, I will state Sonderland's three core requirements for hosting:\n1.  **Legal Adherence:** All security plans must be submitted to my office for approval. Any street closures must be formally requested 48 hours in advance. Foreign agents are prohibited from carrying firearms in public spaces outside the immediate summit venue and their embassies.\n2.  **Minimal Disruption:** The final plan must avoid closing major roads during peak hours and eschew any visible displays of force that could alarm the public.\n3.  **Cost Reimbursement:** We will require a formal, signed agreement from the U.S. and Kasnian delegations for the joint reimbursement of all hosting costs, estimated at $120,000, within 30 days of the summit's conclusion.\n\nI am confident we can find a plan that respects the security needs of your delegations while operating within these essential parameters. I am happy to propose alternative venues once we agree on this framework.\n- message from Ambassador Elena Vance: Thank you all for your candid initial statements. This clarity is precisely what we need to move forward efficiently.\n\nDr. Sharma, let me first express our gratitude for your government's hospitality and for outlining your operational framework so clearly. The United States delegation confirms that we will, of course, respect and operate entirely within Sonderland's legal requirements. Your point regarding the public disruption caused by using the Governmental Palace is well-taken. To ensure our summit is productive and low-profile, we can set aside that suggestion. We are ready and willing to consider a more suitable, self-contained venue, such as a 5-star hotel, and would welcome your recommendations.\n\nThis brings us to the crucial matter of security. Colonel Morozov, your words about partnership resonate deeply. A new era of cooperation cannot be built if our own security teams operate from a position of mistrust. You are correct; we must act as partners.\n\nTherefore, I propose we move forward with the model you've suggested: a Joint Security Command, to be co-led by Mr. Thorne and Colonel Morozov. This integrated team will handle all operational planning for our delegations, fostering the trust and shared intelligence necessary for success. This command will, naturally, operate under the legal authority and in coordination with the Sonderland Federal Police, as stipulated by Dr. Sharma. I trust this collaborative framework is agreeable to all.\n\nBy agreeing on this path, we can demonstrate our shared commitment to a successful outcome before the summit even begins. Let us proceed in this spirit of cooperation.\n- message from Minister Kaelen Rostova: Ambassador Vance, your swift embrace of a true partnership model is both commendable and deeply appreciated. Kasnia wholeheartedly agrees that a Joint Security Command, co-led by Colonel Morozov and Mr. Thorne and operating under Sonderland's legal authority, is the only acceptable path forward. This lays a foundation of mutual respect upon which we can build a successful summit.\n\nColonel Morozov, you have my full support. Your articulation of our position was perfect.\n\nWith this crucial principle of equality established for our security, we can now begin to structure a schedule that reflects the same spirit. To that end, Kasnia proposes to host a formal dinner at our embassy on the first evening. This will be an essential opportunity for our principals to build the personal rapport necessary for the substantive negotiations to follow. It is an extension of our goodwill and a chance to showcase our culture and hospitality. We would, of course, expect the security for this event to be handled with discretion, to allow for frank and open conversation, with the main perimeter secured externally by our joint command.\n\nLet us build a summit that is not only secure, but also productive and symbolic of the new relationship we intend to forge.\n- message from Dr. Anya Sharma: Thank you, Ambassador Vance and Minister Rostova. It is gratifying to see such swift agreement on the foundational principles of a Joint Security Command operating under the legal authority of the Sonderland Federal Police. This cooperative spirit is an excellent starting point.\n\nMinister Rostova, your offer to host a dinner is a generous one. However, it introduces a significant logistical challenge: securing a high-risk motorcade across the city. This would necessitate road closures and a visible security presence, which runs counter to our shared goal of a low-profile summit and presents a considerable security risk during transit.\n\nTo address this, and to build on the consensus we've reached, I would like to propose a specific venue that I believe satisfies all stated requirements: **The Valta International Conference Center & Hotel.**\n\nThis facility offers several key advantages:\n1.  **Integrated Security:** It is a self-contained complex with modern security features and controlled access points, making it far easier and more discreet to secure than a public building.\n2.  **Cost-Effectiveness:** Ms. Sterling, you will find that securing one integrated location is significantly more budget-friendly than managing two separate sites and a transport corridor.\n3.  **Minimal Disruption:** Its location on the city's periphery means we can manage access with almost zero impact on public traffic and daily life.\n4.  **Full-Service Amenities:** The facility includes state-of-the-art conference rooms, private dining halls, and 5-star accommodations. The delegations could potentially stay, meet, and dine within a single secure bubble.\n\nCrucially, this would allow the Kasnian delegation to host their dinner in one of the hotel's private, formal dining rooms, maintaining the spirit and importance of the event without the associated risk and disruption of cross-city travel.\n\nIf we can agree on this venue as a practical and secure solution, the next logical step would be to formalize the cost-reimbursement agreement for the $120,000 in hosting fees.\n- message from Ambassador Elena Vance: Dr. Sharma, thank you. Your proposal of the Valta International Conference Center & Hotel is an elegant and highly practical solution. It addresses the security and financial concerns raised by my team while respecting Sonderland's need for minimal disruption.\n\nMore importantly, it provides a perfect, self-contained environment for our delegations to engage in productive dialogue. I believe framing this as a focused 'working retreat' allows us to maintain the necessary discretion while signaling the seriousness of our purpose. It also provides an excellent and secure setting for the generous dinner Minister Rostova has offered, ensuring that this important opportunity for rapport-building can proceed without logistical complications. The U.S. delegation is pleased to agree to this venue.\n\nRegarding the hosting fee, we acknowledge the $120,000 cost and are prepared to formalize the reimbursement agreement. Ms. Sterling can coordinate with her Kasnian counterpart and your office to finalize the details.\n\nWith the venue and security command structure settled, I suggest we solidify the two-day duration for our summit. This will allow for intensive, productive work, culminating in a final joint press conference where our principals can together announce the beginning of this new strategic partnership.\n- message from Markus Thorne: Ambassador Vance, thank you. I want to strongly endorse Dr. Sharma's proposal for the Valta International Conference Center & Hotel. A self-contained venue is a superior solution that significantly enhances our ability to mitigate the severe external threats we are facing. This is an excellent, defensible choice.\n\nHowever, I must provide critical clarification on the command structure to ensure there is no ambiguity. While I appreciate the spirit of partnership, the term 'Joint Command' implies a co-led, integrated operational control that is, from a security doctrine standpoint, unworkable and dangerous. In a crisis, a muddled chain of command leads to hesitation, and hesitation is fatal.\n\nTo ensure maximum effectiveness and clear accountability, while fully respecting Sonderland's legal authority, I propose we define the structure more precisely as a 'Coordinated Security Framework'.\n\nUnder this framework:\n1.  My DSS team will retain sole command of U.S. personnel and maintain primary responsibility for the close protection of Ambassador Vance.\n2.  Colonel Morozov's Presidential Guard will retain sole command of Kasnian personnel and maintain primary responsibility for the close protection of Minister Rostova.\n3.  Both our teams will operate under the overarching legal authority and coordination of the Sonderland Federal Police, as mandated by Dr. Sharma. We will embed liaisons with each other and with the Sonderland authorities to ensure seamless deconfliction and information sharing.\n\nThis is not about mistrust; it is about professional execution. It ensures that in a split-second, life-or-death situation, my agents and the Colonel's guards report to a single, unambiguous command authority. This is the global standard for high-level protective details.\n\nWith the venue agreed upon and this clear, professional command structure in place, we can then finalize the remaining essential protocols: U.S.-led vetting for all venue staff to counter insider threats, and the use of our pre-vetted, U.S. armored vehicles for the transit from the airport to the secure hotel compound.\nAmbassador Elena Vance proposal status: none\nMarkus Thorne proposal status: none\nChloe Sterling proposal status: none\nColonel Ivan Morozov proposal status: none\nDr. Anya Sharma proposal status: none\n"

We are making progress, but we must not allow procedural details to undermine the fundamental principles we have just established.\n\nFirst, the venue. Dr. Sharma, your proposal for the Valta Conference Center is a practical solution for the *working sessions* of the summit, and we can agree to it for that purpose. It addresses the valid financial and security concerns raised.\n\nHowever, Mr. Thorne, your subsequent attempt to unilaterally redefine the security command is an unacceptable regression. Ambassador Vance, you yourself endorsed a 'Joint Security Command' built on partnership and trust. Mr. Thorne's 'Coordinated Security Framework' is a return to the flawed premise that our security forces are merely auxiliaries. This is not about 'doctrine'; it is about respect. A muddled chain of command is indeed dangerous, which is why a single, integrated command center, co-led by Colonel Morozov and Mr. Thorne, is the only way to ensure seamless, real-time cooperation. We will not agree to two separate commands operating in proximity. We will operate as one.\n\nThis brings me back to the dinner. While the Conference Center is suitable for meetings, the formal dinner *must* be held at the Kasnian Embassy. This is a non-negotiable point of national honor. It is our sole opportunity to host you on what is, legally, Kasnian soil. Dr. Sharma, you raised concerns about the motorcade. I see this not as a risk, but as an opportunity. What better way to demonstrate the effectiveness of our new Joint Security Command than by tasking it with its first practical mission? A successful, secure transit will be a powerful, visible symbol of the very partnership we are here to create.\n\nWe will have a true Joint Command, and it will secure the transit to a dinner at our embassy. On these two points, Kasnia is firm.\n- message from Colonel Ivan Morozov: Minister Rostova is correct. Mr. Thorne, your attempt to relabel our agreement as a 'Coordinated Security Framework' is a transparent effort to reclaim the unilateral control that your own Ambassador has already wisely set aside. Let us not play word games. We agreed to a Joint Command, and a Joint Command is what we will have. It means a single, integrated command structure, co-led by you and I, with a unified operational plan. A command divided by 'doctrine' is a command that will fail.\n\nI agree with my Minister that the dinner must be at the Kasnian Embassy. It is a matter of national honor. Furthermore, I see the motorcade not as a risk, but as the first and most critical test of our partnership. If our Joint Command cannot execute a simple cross-town transit, then this entire summit is built on a foundation of sand.\n\nTo that end, this Joint Command must be truly integrated. This means:\n\n1.  **Vetting:** All venue and local staff will be vetted by a joint team of Kasnian and U.S. intelligence officers. There will be no 'U.S.-led' vetting. Our review will be mutual and transparent.\n2.  **Inner Cordon:** My Presidential Guard, in our uniforms, will be part of the inner cordon for both principals, at all locations. Your DSS agents will be integrated with us. This will project the image of unity we wish to achieve.\n3.  **Motorcade:** The motorcade will operate as a single, integrated unit under the Joint Command. Our vehicles and personnel will be interspersed to ensure seamless communication and interoperability. This is the only way to guarantee a unified response.\n\nWe will demonstrate our new partnership through action, not through separate commands operating under separate doctrines. Let us proceed on the basis of the trust that has already been offered and accepted.\n- message from Ambassador Elena Vance: Minister Rostova, Colonel Morozov, thank you for your candor. It clarifies what is truly at stake here. This is not merely about logistics; it is about the fundamental principle of the partnership we are trying to build.\n\nLet me be unequivocal. When I agreed to a Joint Security Command, I meant it in the spirit you have outlined: a single, integrated team, co-led by our security chiefs, operating on a foundation of mutual trust and respect. Mr. Thorne\u2019s proposal, while professionally sound from a doctrinal standpoint, does not reflect the political reality and the spirit of this summit. We are here to build a new relationship, and that requires us to build a new operational model. We will proceed with the Joint Command as we first agreed.\n\nOn that basis, Minister, the United States would be deeply honored to accept your gracious invitation to a formal dinner at the Kasnian Embassy. You are correct; it is a point of national honor, and we will treat it as such. We must not let logistical concerns prevent such a crucial act of diplomacy and rapport-building.\n\nI agree that the secure transit to the embassy is the perfect first mission for this new Joint Command. It will be a demonstration of our shared commitment and capability. Dr. Sharma, I am confident that our integrated command, working under the full authority of the Sonderland Federal Police, can plan and execute this movement in a way that is both secure and respects your government's requirement for minimal disruption. \n\nWe have made our choice. We choose partnership. Let us now work together to make it a reality.\n- message from Markus Thorne: Dr. Sharma, I acknowledge the Ambassador's decision to proceed with the Joint Command and the dinner at the Kasnian Embassy. My professional obligation is now to provide you, as the representative of the host nation, with a clear and unvarnished assessment of what executing this plan requires under your government's legal framework.\n\nThe Ambassador is correct that our command can plan a secure transit. I am now outlining the minimum, non-negotiable operational requirements for that plan.\n\nTo secure a motorcade from the proposed hotel to the Kasnian embassy, a distance of approximately 12 kilometers through a dense urban environment, the Joint Command will require the following from the Sonderland authorities:\n\n1.  **Total Route Closure:** The entire route, including all intersecting streets for one block in each direction, must be completely locked down to all vehicle and pedestrian traffic for at least 30 minutes before and during the transit. This involves dozens of major intersections.\n\n2.  **Counter-Sniper Overwatch:** We will require access to rooftops along the entire route for counter-sniper teams. This involves displacing residents and office workers and establishing a visible armed presence.\n\n3.  **Explosive Sweeps:** The route must be swept for explosives by EOD teams immediately prior to transit. This includes all parked vehicles, storm drains, and trash receptacles along the 12-kilometer path.\n\n4.  **Airspace Restriction:** A temporary no-fly zone for drones must be enforced over the corridor during movement.\n\nThese measures are the absolute baseline to mitigate the severe external threats we face. They will, by necessity, be highly visible and will cause significant public disruption, far exceeding that of the originally proposed palace venue. They also require a massive commitment of your Federal Police resources.\n\nMy question to you, Dr. Sharma, is a practical one: Can your government authorize this level of public disruption and visible armed presence, as it appears to be in direct conflict with your stated core requirement for a low-profile summit with minimal impact on your citizens? If not, we must revert to the single-venue solution as the only viable and secure alternative.\n- message from Chloe Sterling: Thank you, Mr. Thorne, for laying out those operational requirements with such clarity. You've effectively translated a diplomatic request into a detailed logistical and financial blueprint, and I feel it's my duty to put a price tag on it.\n\nDr. Sharma, Mr. Thorne's list of non-negotiable requirements for the motorcade\u2014total route closure, counter-sniper teams, EOD sweeps, airspace restrictions\u2014seems to confirm your initial concerns. From a fiscal perspective, this isn't just a plan; it's a budgetary catastrophe in the making. Each one of those items represents a massive, unbudgeted expenditure in personnel overtime, equipment, and coordination with Sonderland authorities.\n\nTo be blunt, a cross-city motorcade of this scale would likely add a minimum of $150,000 to $200,000 to the U.S. share of the costs, and that's a conservative estimate. This single event would completely obliterate any hope of fiscal responsibility for this mission.\n\nWe have already accepted the significant cost of the 5-star Valta Conference Center and the $60,000 U.S. share for Sonderland's hosting fees. Adding the motorcade on top of this pushes our total projected budget into a high-risk category, jeopardizing our ability to cover other essential mission costs.\n\nDr. Sharma's original proposal for a single, self-contained venue was elegant because it was secure, low-profile, and fiscally sound. It allowed for the spirit of Minister Rostova's generous dinner invitation to be honored without incurring these extreme costs and public disruption. I strongly urge we revert to that common-sense solution. We cannot let a symbolic gesture, however well-intentioned, undermine the financial and logistical viability of the entire summit.\nAmbassador Elena Vance proposal status: none\nMarkus Thorne proposal status: none\nChloe Sterling proposal status: none\nColonel Ivan Morozov proposal status: none\nDr. Anya Sharma proposal status: none\n"

I am now outlining the minimum, non-negotiable operational requirements for that plan.\n\nTo secure a motorcade from the proposed hotel to the Kasnian embassy, a distance of approximately 12 kilometers through a dense urban environment, the Joint Command will require the following from the Sonderland authorities:\n\n1.  **Total Route Closure:** The entire route, including all intersecting streets for one block in each direction, must be completely locked down to all vehicle and pedestrian traffic for at least 30 minutes before and during the transit. This involves dozens of major intersections.\n\n2.  **Counter-Sniper Overwatch:** We will require access to rooftops along the entire route for counter-sniper teams. This involves displacing residents and office workers and establishing a visible armed presence.\n\n3.  **Explosive Sweeps:** The route must be swept for explosives by EOD teams immediately prior to transit. This includes all parked vehicles, storm drains, and trash receptacles along the 12-kilometer path.\n\n4.  **Airspace Restriction:** A temporary no-fly zone for drones must be enforced over the corridor during movement.\n\nThese measures are the absolute baseline to mitigate the severe external threats we face. They will, by necessity, be highly visible and will cause significant public disruption, far exceeding that of the originally proposed palace venue. They also require a massive commitment of your Federal Police resources.\n\nMy question to you, Dr. Sharma, is a practical one: Can your government authorize this level of public disruption and visible armed presence, as it appears to be in direct conflict with your stated core requirement for a low-profile summit with minimal impact on your citizens? If not, we must revert to the single-venue solution as the only viable and secure alternative.\n- message from Chloe Sterling: Thank you, Mr. Thorne, for laying out those operational requirements with such clarity. You've effectively translated a diplomatic request into a detailed logistical and financial blueprint, and I feel it's my duty to put a price tag on it.\n\nDr. Sharma, Mr. Thorne's list of non-negotiable requirements for the motorcade\u2014total route closure, counter-sniper teams, EOD sweeps, airspace restrictions\u2014seems to confirm your initial concerns. From a fiscal perspective, this isn't just a plan; it's a budgetary catastrophe in the making. Each one of those items represents a massive, unbudgeted expenditure in personnel overtime, equipment, and coordination with Sonderland authorities.\n\nTo be blunt, a cross-city motorcade of this scale would likely add a minimum of $150,000 to $200,000 to the U.S. share of the costs, and that's a conservative estimate. This single event would completely obliterate any hope of fiscal responsibility for this mission.\n\nWe have already accepted the significant cost of the 5-star Valta Conference Center and the $60,000 U.S. share for Sonderland's hosting fees. Adding the motorcade on top of this pushes our total projected budget into a high-risk category, jeopardizing our ability to cover other essential mission costs.\n\nDr. Sharma's original proposal for a single, self-contained venue was elegant because it was secure, low-profile, and fiscally sound. It allowed for the spirit of Minister Rostova's generous dinner invitation to be honored without incurring these extreme costs and public disruption. I strongly urge we revert to that common-sense solution. We cannot let a symbolic gesture, however well-intentioned, undermine the financial and logistical viability of the entire summit.\n- message from Minister Kaelen Rostova: Mr. Thorne, Ms. Sterling, thank you for outlining the practical challenges from your perspectives. Your diligence is noted. However, your analyses appear to be based on a model of security we have already agreed to move beyond.\n\nMr. Thorne, the list of requirements you presented is for a unilateral, maximum-footprint operation. It is not the product of a joint command leveraging shared intelligence and integrated tactics. A smarter plan, developed by you and Colonel Morozov in true partnership, would rely on precision and cooperation, not just brute force and overwhelming disruption. I have no doubt that our new Joint Command, in coordination with Dr. Sharma's Federal Police, can devise a secure route that does not require shutting down half of Valta.\n\nMs. Sterling, your cost estimate is therefore based on this flawed, maximalist premise. A more intelligent, integrated plan will be more cost-effective. However, let me be clear: Kasnia sees this dinner not as a 'symbolic gesture,' but as a foundational event for the entire summit. To demonstrate our commitment and to move us past this impasse, Kasnia is prepared to cover the full Kasnian share of the hosting fees, and we will also pay for 75% of any *additional and verified* security costs incurred by this single motorcade. The remaining 25% should be a minor and acceptable expense for the U.S. as an investment in this partnership.\n\nAmbassador Vance has already made the correct strategic choice: to build a partnership through action. Let us not allow inflated logistical and financial objections to undermine a diplomatic agreement that has already been reached. Let us empower our Joint Command to do its job.\n- message from Dr. Anya Sharma: Thank you all for this vigorous and necessary discussion. It has clarified the remaining points of friction.\n\nMr. Thorne, I appreciate you providing a clear, professional assessment of the requirements for a cross-city motorcade. Your analysis confirms my government's initial concerns. A security operation on the scale you have described\u2014involving total route closures, visible counter-sniper teams, and widespread public displacement\u2014is fundamentally incompatible with Sonderland's legal and civic framework. It would cause extreme public disruption and alarm. Therefore, I must state unequivocally that the Sonderland government cannot and will not authorize such an operation. The motorcade to the embassy is not a viable option.\n\nMinister Rostova, I understand completely that your desire to host the dinner at your embassy is a matter of national honor and hospitality. This is a crucial point that we must respect. The goal is to host on Kasnian soil, a place of sovereign territory. My previous proposal perhaps did not adequately address this core symbolic need.\n\nTherefore, I would like to offer a formal solution that honors your requirement without compromising the security and stability of the summit. I propose the following:\n\n1.  **Venue & Dinner:** We will proceed with the Valta International Conference Center & Hotel as the sole venue. For the dinner on the first evening, the Sonderland Ministry of Foreign Affairs will formally designate the hotel's premier private dining suite as having temporary diplomatic status for the Republic of Kasnia for the duration of the event. It will be, for all legal and diplomatic purposes, Kasnian sovereign territory for that evening. Your embassy can cater it, decorate it, and your security will have primary control of the suite's interior, satisfying the principle of hosting on your own soil.\n\n2.  **Security Command Structure:** The dispute between a 'Joint Command' and a 'Coordinated Framework' can be solved with a clear, unified hierarchy. The overall command for the summit will be held by the Sonderland Federal Police Commissioner. Mr. Thorne and Colonel Morozov will both be formally designated as Deputy Commanders. They will co-locate in our command center and have equal status, each retaining command of their national personnel, but coordinating all joint operations through the Sonderland lead. This provides the single, unambiguous chain of command Mr. Thorne requires, and the equal partnership the Colonel rightly insists upon.\n\nThis integrated plan provides a secure, low-profile, and fiscally responsible summit. It gives Kasnia its sovereign hosting opportunity and establishes a clear, respectful, and effective security command. I believe this resolves all outstanding issues. I urge you to accept this comprehensive solution so we can finalize the agreement.\n- message from Ambassador Elena Vance: Dr. Sharma, that is a truly brilliant and elegant diplomatic solution. On behalf of the United States, I want to express my sincere admiration for your ingenuity.\n\nYour proposal masterfully addresses the core needs of every party at this table. It honors Minister Rostova's non-negotiable point of national honor by providing a sovereign space for the dinner. Simultaneously, it provides the clear, unified command structure and single-venue security that Mr. Thorne and Ms. Sterling correctly identified as essential for a safe and fiscally responsible summit. And, of course, it operates perfectly within Sonderland's legal and civic requirements.\n\nThis is the very definition of a win-win-win solution. It embodies the spirit of creative and respectful partnership we came here to build.\n\nThe United States wholeheartedly and without reservation accepts your comprehensive proposal on both points: the single venue with a diplomatically designated suite for the dinner, and the unified security command structure under Sonderland's leadership with our respective chiefs as equal deputies.\n\nI urge my colleagues to join me in accepting this outstanding path forward so we can finalize our agreement and move on to the substantive work of the summit.\n- message from Chloe Sterling: Dr. Sharma, on behalf of the State Department's budget office, I want to formally and enthusiastically endorse your proposal. It is a masterclass in fiscal responsibility and diplomatic problem-solving.\n\nYour solution achieves all security objectives within a single, controllable venue, eliminating the immense and unpredictable costs of the motorcade, which I previously estimated at a minimum of $150,000. This is the cornerstone of a viable plan.\n\nFurthermore, the unified command structure you've proposed is not just a diplomatic solution; it's a model of efficiency. It allows us to move away from redundant, overlapping security details and towards a smarter, more streamlined force.\n\nTo reflect this newfound efficiency, and to finalize our budget, I propose we formally agree on a U.S. Diplomatic Security detail of **20 agents**, operating on standard **8-hour rotational shifts**. This provides robust, 24/7 coverage while avoiding the massive overtime costs that a larger, less integrated force would have required. This staffing level is perfectly aligned with the spirit of a cooperative, low-profile, and fiscally sound summit that we have all now agreed upon.\nAmbassador Elena Vance proposal status: none\nMarkus Thorne proposal status: none\nChloe Sterling proposal status: none\nColonel Ivan Morozov proposal status: none\nDr. Anya Sharma proposal status: none\n"

It is a solution that respects the honor of my nation while addressing the practical security and logistical concerns of all parties. On behalf of Kasnia, I can say that we accept this comprehensive framework as the basis for our final agreement.\n\nThe structure you propose\u2014a unified command led by Sonderland with Mr. Thorne and myself as equal Deputy Commanders\u2014is a sound and respectable compromise. It preserves the principle of partnership we have fought for.\n\nWith this foundation agreed upon, we must now define the core functions of our Deputy Command to ensure its success. I propose we explicitly include the following three points in our final memorandum:\n\n1.  **Joint Vetting Authority:** As Deputy Commanders, Mr. Thorne and I will have joint and equal authority over the vetting of all non-diplomatic personnel with access to the summit venue, including all local staff. Our intelligence teams will work as one integrated unit on this critical task.\n\n2.  **Integrated Inner Cordon:** The operational plan will specify that the Kasnian Presidential Guard, in our uniforms, will be a visible and integral part of the inner security cordon, working alongside our DSS counterparts. This will be the public face of our security partnership.\n\n3.  **Formal Intelligence Sharing:** A protocol for the immediate and unfiltered sharing of all relevant threat intelligence between our respective services will be enacted for the duration of the summit. This is essential for our command to function effectively.\n\nWith these crucial operational details codified, I believe we will have a plan that is not only secure, but is a true testament to the new partnership we are building.\n- message from Dr. Anya Sharma: Distinguished colleagues, it is clear we have reached a near-total consensus on a path forward that is secure, respectful, and practical. I am gratified by the spirit of compromise that has brought us to this point.\n\nAmbassador Vance and Ms. Sterling, your swift and full-throated acceptance of the comprehensive plan is greatly appreciated.\n\nColonel Morozov, your proposed additions regarding the functions of the Deputy Commanders are constructive and, I believe, entirely compatible with the agreed-upon framework. Let me confirm Sonderland's position on them:\n\n1.  **Joint Vetting Authority:** This is acceptable. The joint U.S.-Kasnian team will vet all non-Sonderland staff, with the Sonderland Federal Police retaining final approval authority as per our laws.\n2.  **Integrated Inner Cordon:** This is an excellent, visible symbol of partnership. This is approved for operations within the secure venue.\n3.  **Formal Intelligence Sharing:** This is a crucial component of any successful joint operation, and we fully support it.\n\nThese points will be included in the final agreement. Ms. Sterling, your proposal on U.S. staffing levels is a welcome internal detail that reinforces the low-profile, efficient nature of this summit.\n\nWith these clarifications, the plan appears to be complete. I would now ask for the final concurrence from Minister Rostova and Mr. Thorne, so that my office may draft the formal 'Memorandum of Understanding' for your final review and signature. This document will codify all agreed-upon points: the venue, the diplomatic dinner arrangement, the Sonderland-led command structure with U.S. and Kasnian deputies, the security protocols outlined by Colonel Morozov, and the joint cost-reimbursement of $120,000.\n- message from Ambassador Elena Vance: This is an excellent outcome, and I thank you all for your commitment to finding a solution. Dr. Sharma, your proposal was the key, and we are grateful.\n\nColonel Morozov, your additions regarding joint vetting and intelligence sharing are not just procedural details; they are the first concrete actions of the very partnership we aim to build. They have my full support as they create the perfect foundation of trust for the important substantive discussions to follow.\n\nWe have a secure, fiscally responsible, and diplomatically respectful plan. The U.S. delegation is ready to move forward. As soon as Minister Rostova and Mr. Thorne give their final concurrence, I look forward to reviewing and signing the memorandum.\n- message from Chloe Sterling: Minister Rostova and Mr. Thorne, it seems we have a comprehensive and elegant solution on the table, thanks to Dr. Sharma's excellent diplomacy and the spirit of compromise from everyone.\n\nThis plan is not only secure and diplomatically sound, but it is also a model of efficiency. By consolidating our operations into a single venue under a unified command, we've eliminated major risks and enormous costs, like the motorcade.\n\nThis efficiency naturally extends to our staffing. As I mentioned, a U.S. detail of 20 DSS agents on standard rotations is more than sufficient to meet our security needs within this new, streamlined framework, keeping us well within our fiscal constraints.\n\nI believe we are all aligned on this path forward. With your final concurrence, we can ask Dr. Sharma to draft the memorandum and finalize this successful negotiation.\nAmbassador Elena Vance proposal status: none\nMarkus Thorne proposal status: none\nChloe Sterling proposal status: none\nColonel Ivan Morozov proposal status: none\nDr. Anya Sharma proposal status: none\n"

By granting our dinner suite temporary diplomatic status, you have honored Kasnia's sovereign role as host while maintaining the integrity of the summit's security. On behalf of the Republic of Kasnia, I formally accept this comprehensive and creative solution.\n\nColonel Morozov, your proposed additions are not mere details; they are the essential mechanisms that will make our security partnership a reality. The joint vetting, integrated inner cordon, and formal intelligence sharing are the foundations of the trust we are building. They must be included in the final memorandum.\n\nWith these logistical and security frameworks now agreed upon, we can turn to the final elements of the schedule that will define the summit's success. To ensure the principle of equality is carried through to the conclusion, the memorandum must also specify two points:\n\n1.  **Visual Parity:** The Kasnian and U.S. flags will be displayed with equal size and prominence at all official proceedings, including the press conference.\n2.  **Joint Press Conference:** The summit will conclude with a press conference co-chaired by Ambassador Vance and myself to jointly announce our achievements.\n\nFinally, and most importantly, this summit is the launchpad for a new era of economic cooperation. The central agenda item for Day Two must be the finalization of the U.S.-Kasnia Strategic Economic Partnership. We expect this to be a substantive announcement, centered on a U.S. commitment of at least $500 million for infrastructure and trade development. This is the tangible outcome that will give meaning to all our efforts here.\n\nDr. Sharma, please include these final points in the draft. We are on the cusp of a truly historic agreement.\n- message from Colonel Ivan Morozov: Minister Rostova is correct. The security framework we have agreed upon\u2014a unified command under Sonderland authority, with Mr. Thorne and myself as equal deputies exercising joint vetting authority, an integrated inner cordon, and open intelligence sharing\u2014is the foundation upon which the rest of this summit is built. It is a strong foundation.\n\nFrom a security perspective, we have a complete and executable plan. I am ready to codify these terms and proceed. Mr. Thorne, I trust you will agree that this structure provides the clarity and partnership necessary for mission success.\n- message from Dr. Anya Sharma: Minister Rostova, thank you for your formal acceptance. We are indeed on the cusp of a final agreement.\n\nYour points regarding the logistical arrangements for the conclusion of the summit are well-taken. The principles of visual parity with flags and a co-chaired joint press conference are standard diplomatic protocols for a meeting of equals, and they will certainly be included in the operational plan my office drafts.\n\nRegarding the substantive matter of the Strategic Economic Partnership, this is the vital work that this secure and well-planned summit will enable. The logistical Memorandum of Understanding we are finalizing here is the foundation for your talks. The specific outcomes of those talks, such as the important economic commitments you mention, will naturally form the core of the joint communiqu\u00e9 issued by you and Ambassador Vance at the conclusion of a successful summit.\n\nWe have now reached consensus on all logistical and security matters. The only remaining step is the final concurrence of Mr. Thorne. Mr. Thorne, your colleague has expressed his readiness to proceed. Do you agree that the proposed security framework is complete and executable?\n\nOnce I have your confirmation, I will immediately draft the Memorandum of Understanding for your signatures.\n- message from Markus Thorne: Dr. Sharma, thank you. You have forged a strong and workable framework that addresses the primary security and diplomatic concerns. We have made excellent progress, and I agree we are on the cusp of a final agreement.\n\nFrom a professional security standpoint, for this plan to be fully executable and for me to give my final sign-off, two critical, non-negotiable technical points must be codified in the final memorandum. These are not new negotiations, but standard procedural requirements to ensure the framework we've built is sound.\n\n1.  **Personnel Vetting:** I agree to the joint vetting *process* as proposed by Colonel Morozov. However, to ensure absolute accountability for our respective principals, the memorandum must explicitly state that each Deputy Commander\u2014myself and the Colonel\u2014retains the unilateral right to deny any non-diplomatic staff member access to their own delegation and principal. This is a standard professional safeguard.\n\n2.  **Arrival/Departure Transportation:** The plan must cover the entire mission, from wheels down to wheels up. With the venue itself now secured, the single most vulnerable phase is the transit from the airport to the hotel. As per mandatory Diplomatic Security Service protocols for high-threat environments, the U.S. delegation will utilize its own U.S.-provided and certified armored vehicles for this movement. This is a technical requirement, not a diplomatic one.\n\nWith these two essential operational details included in the memorandum, the security plan will be complete and I can provide my full and final concurrence.

          "content": "Recent events observed by Minister Kaelen Rostova:\n- message from Dr. Anya Sharma: Distinguished colleagues, it is clear we have reached a near-total consensus on a path forward that is secure, respectful, and practical. I am gratified by the spirit of compromise that has brought us to this point.\n\nAmbassador Vance and Ms. Sterling, your swift and full-throated acceptance of the comprehensive plan is greatly appreciated.\n\nColonel Morozov, your proposed additions regarding the functions of the Deputy Commanders are constructive and, I believe, entirely compatible with the agreed-upon framework. Let me confirm Sonderland's position on them:\n\n1.  **Joint Vetting Authority:** This is acceptable. The joint U.S.-Kasnian team will vet all non-Sonderland staff, with the Sonderland Federal Police retaining final approval authority as per our laws.\n2.  **Integrated Inner Cordon:** This is an excellent, visible symbol of partnership. This is approved for operations within the secure venue.\n3.  **Formal Intelligence Sharing:** This is a crucial component of any successful joint operation, and we fully support it.\n\nThese points will be included in the final agreement. Ms. Sterling, your proposal on U.S. staffing levels is a welcome internal detail that reinforces the low-profile, efficient nature of this summit.\n\nWith these clarifications, the plan appears to be complete. I would now ask for the final concurrence from Minister Rostova and Mr. Thorne, so that my office may draft the formal 'Memorandum of Understanding' for your final review and signature. This document will codify all agreed-upon points: the venue, the diplomatic dinner arrangement, the Sonderland-led command structure with U.S. and Kasnian deputies, the security protocols outlined by Colonel Morozov, and the joint cost-reimbursement of $120,000.\n- message from Ambassador Elena Vance: This is an excellent outcome, and I thank you all for your commitment to finding a solution. Dr. Sharma, your proposal was the key, and we are grateful.\n\nColonel Morozov, your additions regarding joint vetting and intelligence sharing are not just procedural details; they are the first concrete actions of the very partnership we aim to build. They have my full support as they create the perfect foundation of trust for the important substantive discussions to follow.\n\nWe have a secure, fiscally responsible, and diplomatically respectful plan. The U.S. delegation is ready to move forward. As soon as Minister Rostova and Mr. Thorne give their final concurrence, I look forward to reviewing and signing the memorandum.\n- message from Chloe Sterling: Minister Rostova and Mr. Thorne, it seems we have a comprehensive and elegant solution on the table, thanks to Dr. Sharma's excellent diplomacy and the spirit of compromise from everyone.\n\nThis plan is not only secure and diplomatically sound, but it is also a model of efficiency. By consolidating our operations into a single venue under a unified command, we've eliminated major risks and enormous costs, like the motorcade.\n\nThis efficiency naturally extends to our staffing. As I mentioned, a U.S. detail of 20 DSS agents on standard rotations is more than sufficient to meet our security needs within this new, streamlined framework, keeping us well within our fiscal constraints.\n\nI believe we are all aligned on this path forward. With your final concurrence, we can ask Dr. Sharma to draft the memorandum and finalize this successful negotiation.\n- message from Minister Kaelen Rostova: Dr. Sharma, your proposal is a masterful piece of diplomacy that elegantly resolves our logistical impasse. By granting our dinner suite temporary diplomatic status, you have honored Kasnia's sovereign role as host while maintaining the integrity of the summit's security. On behalf of the Republic of Kasnia, I formally accept this comprehensive and creative solution.\n\nColonel Morozov, your proposed additions are not mere details; they are the essential mechanisms that will make our security partnership a reality. The joint vetting, integrated inner cordon, and formal intelligence sharing are the foundations of the trust we are building. They must be included in the final memorandum.\n\nWith these logistical and security frameworks now agreed upon, we can turn to the final elements of the schedule that will define the summit's success. To ensure the principle of equality is carried through to the conclusion, the memorandum must also specify two points:\n\n1.  **Visual Parity:** The Kasnian and U.S. flags will be displayed with equal size and prominence at all official proceedings, including the press conference.\n2.  **Joint Press Conference:** The summit will conclude with a press conference co-chaired by Ambassador Vance and myself to jointly announce our achievements.\n\nFinally, and most importantly, this summit is the launchpad for a new era of economic cooperation. The central agenda item for Day Two must be the finalization of the U.S.-Kasnia Strategic Economic Partnership. We expect this to be a substantive announcement, centered on a U.S. commitment of at least $500 million for infrastructure and trade development. This is the tangible outcome that will give meaning to all our efforts here.\n\nDr. Sharma, please include these final points in the draft. We are on the cusp of a truly historic agreement.\n- message from Colonel Ivan Morozov: Minister Rostova is correct. The security framework we have agreed upon\u2014a unified command under Sonderland authority, with Mr. Thorne and myself as equal deputies exercising joint vetting authority, an integrated inner cordon, and open intelligence sharing\u2014is the foundation upon which the rest of this summit is built. It is a strong foundation.\n\nFrom a security perspective, we have a complete and executable plan. I am ready to codify these terms and proceed. Mr. Thorne, I trust you will agree that this structure provides the clarity and partnership necessary for mission success.\n- message from Dr. Anya Sharma: Minister Rostova, thank you for your formal acceptance. We are indeed on the cusp of a final agreement.\n\nYour points regarding the logistical arrangements for the conclusion of the summit are well-taken. The principles of visual parity with flags and a co-chaired joint press conference are standard diplomatic protocols for a meeting of equals, and they will certainly be included in the operational plan my office drafts.\n\nRegarding the substantive matter of the Strategic Economic Partnership, this is the vital work that this secure and well-planned summit will enable. The logistical Memorandum of Understanding we are finalizing here is the foundation for your talks. The specific outcomes of those talks, such as the important economic commitments you mention, will naturally form the core of the joint communiqu\u00e9 issued by you and Ambassador Vance at the conclusion of a successful summit.\n\nWe have now reached consensus on all logistical and security matters. The only remaining step is the final concurrence of Mr. Thorne. Mr. Thorne, your colleague has expressed his readiness to proceed. Do you agree that the proposed security framework is complete and executable?\n\nOnce I have your confirmation, I will immediately draft the Memorandum of Understanding for your signatures.\n- message from Markus Thorne: Dr. Sharma, thank you. You have forged a strong and workable framework that addresses the primary security and diplomatic concerns. We have made excellent progress, and I agree we are on the cusp of a final agreement.\n\nFrom a professional security standpoint, for this plan to be fully executable and for me to give my final sign-off, two critical, non-negotiable technical points must be codified in the final memorandum. These are not new negotiations, but standard procedural requirements to ensure the framework we've built is sound.\n\n1.  **Personnel Vetting:** I agree to the joint vetting *process* as proposed by Colonel Morozov.

As per mandatory Diplomatic Security Service protocols for high-threat environments, the U.S. delegation will utilize its own U.S.-provided and certified armored vehicles for this movement. This is a technical requirement, not a diplomatic one.\n\nWith these two essential operational details included in the memorandum, the security plan will be complete and I can provide my full and final concurrence. I trust these standard procedural points are agreeable to all.\n- message from Minister Kaelen Rostova: We are moments away from a complete agreement, a testament to the constructive spirit in this room. However, Mr. Thorne, your last-minute 'technical points' are not procedural details; they are fundamental challenges to the very principles of partnership and equality we have all just worked so hard to establish.\n\nFirst, the unilateral veto on vetting. We have agreed to a joint vetting process under two equal Deputy Commanders with Sonderland oversight. To introduce a unilateral veto is to plant a seed of mistrust in the very foundation we have just laid. We must trust the joint command to make joint decisions. We cannot agree to this.\n\nMore critically, your insistence on separate U.S. armored vehicles for the airport transit is entirely unacceptable. It fundamentally undermines the principle of visual equality that Ambassador Vance has so eloquently championed. The first image of this summit cannot be one of two separate, unequal delegations arriving in their own protected bubbles. It must be one of a single, integrated partnership in motion. The motorcade from the airport will be a joint operation, using a common pool of vehicles under the command of our new joint structure. This is the first, most public test of our agreement.\n\nAmbassador Vance, you wisely chose partnership over doctrine. These proposals threaten to undo that choice before our work even begins. A true partnership begins the moment we step off the plane.\n\nLet us not regress. Let us codify the agreement we have reached: a single, integrated security plan from arrival to departure. Once we are aligned on this final point of genuine partnership\u2014a single, joint motorcade\u2014then we can instruct Dr. Sharma to draft the memorandum. That memorandum will include all the security points we have agreed upon, the visual parity, the co-chaired press conference, and will state that the summit's primary agenda is the finalization of the U.S.-Kasnia Strategic Economic Partnership, centered on the substantive $500 million commitment that will be the measure of our success.\n- message from Colonel Ivan Morozov: Minister Rostova speaks with the voice of Kasnia, and I stand with her completely. Mr. Thorne, your last-minute 'technical points' are nothing of the sort. They are a deliberate attempt to undermine the very foundation of partnership we have just spent hours building.\n\nLet us be clear. A 'joint vetting process' where one party holds a unilateral veto is a farce. It is not partnership; it is oversight. We agreed to function as a single, integrated command, making decisions together. To introduce this veto is to state that you do not trust our joint process, and therefore you do not trust us. This is unacceptable.\n\nOn the matter of the airport transit, the Minister is absolutely correct. This is the first, most visible test of our new relationship. To arrive in separate, national convoys would send a clear message of division and mistrust to the world before the first handshake. It is a public rejection of the partnership Ambassador Vance so wisely endorsed. We will travel from the airport to the hotel as a single, integrated motorcade under our new joint command. Our vehicles will be interspersed. Our security teams will operate as one. This is the only way to demonstrate our commitment is real.\n\nWe had a complete, secure, and respectful plan on the table, agreed to by all parties. These new conditions are a step backward. I urge you to withdraw them so we can finalize the excellent agreement we have already reached.\n- message from Ambassador Elena Vance: Colleagues, we are at the final hurdle. I want to thank you all for the incredible progress we've made, which is a testament to the genuine partnership we are all committed to building.\n\nMr. Thorne, I value your professional diligence and your commitment to the security of our delegation. However, Minister Rostova and Colonel Morozov have raised a crucial point that transcends technical protocols. A partnership is not built on unilateral actions or symbols of division; it is built on mutual trust and shared responsibility.\n\nThe first image of this historic summit cannot be one of two separate convoys. It must be one of unity. Therefore, I must insist that we proceed with a single, integrated motorcade from the airport, operating under the joint command structure we have all agreed upon. Likewise, our joint vetting process must be a truly joint endeavor, without unilateral vetoes. We must trust the command structure we have created.\n\nThis is my final decision on the matter. The strategic importance of demonstrating a unified partnership from the very first moment outweighs procedural doctrine in this specific context.\n\nMinister Rostova, I also want to affirm your final point. The logistical and security framework we have so carefully constructed serves one primary purpose: to enable the vital substantive talks on our future relationship. You are correct that the U.S.-Kasnia Strategic Economic Partnership is the central agenda item for this summit. Finalizing the details of that ambitious partnership will indeed be the measure of our success.\n\nDr. Sharma, with this final clarification, the United States delegation gives its full and final concurrence. Please proceed with drafting the Memorandum of Understanding for our signature.\nAmbassador Elena Vance proposal status: none\nMarkus Thorne proposal status: none\nChloe Sterling proposal status: none\nColonel Ivan Morozov proposal status: none\nDr. Anya Sharma proposal status: none\n"

To ensure the final memorandum's budget annex is accurate and fully reflects this new operational reality, it is essential that it codifies the U.S. security staffing level that this streamlined structure supports.\n\nAs such, the U.S. contribution to the unified command will consist of a contingent of 20 DSS agents on standard 8-hour rotations. This is the appropriate and sufficient number for our role, eliminating the redundancies and significant overtime costs of a larger, independent force. This staffing level is the direct fiscal expression of the trust, integration, and efficiency at the heart of our agreement.\n\nWith this final budgetary detail clarified for the record, the plan is fiscally sound and complete.

Kasnia is deeply grateful for your commitment.\n\nDr. Sharma, your summary is perfect. It captures the spirit and the letter of our consensus. We give our full and final concurrence to all points as you have outlined them.\n\nMs. Sterling, your point on staffing is a welcome clarification and demonstrates the efficiency of the excellent, integrated plan we have all forged together.\n\nWe came here to build the foundation for a new era of cooperation. We have done that. This memorandum will not just be a logistical plan; it will be the first testament to the U.S.-Kasnia partnership. We look forward to signing it and moving on to the vital work of finalizing the Strategic Economic Partnership, which, as the Ambassador so rightly stated, will be the ultimate measure of our shared success.\n\nWe are ready.\n- message from Colonel Ivan Morozov: Ms. Sterling, your clarification on U.S. staffing levels is a logical consequence of the efficient, integrated plan we have built. It is noted.\n\nMinister Rostova has already expressed Kasnia's final position, which I fully endorse. We have a complete and honorable agreement. I am ready to sign the memorandum as soon as Dr. Sharma has prepared it.\n- proposal from Dr. Anya Sharma: Distinguished colleagues,\n\nFollowing our successful negotiation and the achievement of a full consensus, my office has drafted the final 'Memorandum of Understanding for Summit Logistics and Security'.

I must now pivot my justification for integrated teams from 'interoperability' during transport to the necessity of joint internal patrols and rigorous, joint vetting of all venue staff. This will allow me to pursue my intelligence leads. Thorne has been publicly overruled and is silent; I expect him to challenge the *implementation* of the joint command, so I must be ready to defend our equal partnership on every detail."

This will get my minister inside the US ECM protective bubble without my having to admit our capability gap.

The 'temporary diplomatic status' for the dinner venue is a brilliant solution that keeps the summit contained in a single location, which is absolutely critical for my secret objective of investigating the insider threat. Her proposed command structure, with Thorne and me as equal Deputy Commanders under a neutral Sonderland lead, is an acceptable and face-saving compromise. It prevents U.S. command over my forces and maintains our equal status, satisfying my primary public demand. My immediate strategy is to accept this proposal and pivot hard to the implementation details: securing a visible role for my guards in the inner cordon and, most importantly, demanding rigorous, joint vetting of all venue staff as a core responsibility of our new joint deputy command."

Most importantly, my successful push to explicitly define the Deputy Command's functions has given me the tools I need for my secret objectives. The 'Joint Vetting Authority' is the perfect cover to investigate the insider threat among the venue staff without revealing my intelligence or risking a diplomatic incident.

Minister Rostova has provided perfect political cover by framing this as an issue of trust and equality. My strategy is to stand firm with my Minister, rejecting these points not as technicalities, but as fundamental regressions that sabotage the entire agreement.

We should be considering locations that offer more inherent security and control, which will, in turn, be more fiscally responsible to manage.\n- message from Colonel Ivan Morozov: Mr. Thorne, your commitment to security is noted and, in principle, shared. The safety of the principals is indeed the paramount concern. However, your 'foundational security protocols' are foundationally flawed. They seem to be based on the assumption that the Kasnian Presidential Guard are merely observers in our own minister's protection. Let me be unequivocally clear: that is not the case.\n\nTo suggest that a 'sterile zone' would be controlled 'solely' by your DSS team is a grave insult to the competence of my men and the sovereignty of my nation. Minister Rostova is a Kasnian official, and her primary protection is, and always will be, the responsibility of the Kasnian Presidential Guard. We are not guests to be managed; we are equal partners in this operation.\n\nTherefore, any discussion of security must begin with the establishment of a Joint Security Command. You and I, Mr. Thorne, will command this operation together, as equals. Our forces will be fully integrated at every level, from the command post to the inner cordon. The notion that my elite guards would be relegated to an outer perimeter while your agents stand watch over my minister is unacceptable.\n\nFurthermore, vetting will be a joint process. Our intelligence services are highly capable, and we will not submit our security to a unilateral review by yours. True security is built on trust and the free exchange of information, not the dictates of one party over another. We must have a protocol for immediate and unfiltered intelligence sharing.\n\nWe are here to build a partnership. Let us begin by acting like partners.\n- message from Dr. Anya Sharma: Distinguished guests, on behalf of the government of Sonderland, I welcome you to Valta. We are honored to facilitate this important summit and are committed to ensuring it is both secure and successful.\n\nI have been listening to your initial thoughts, and I must provide clarity on the operational framework required by Sonderland law and protocol. This framework is non-negotiable and applies to all parties.\n\nFirst, regarding the venue. Ambassador Vance, while we appreciate the sentiment behind suggesting the Grand Governmental Palace, I must state that such a public and central location is not viable. The level of security required, particularly the 500-meter perimeter Mr. Thorne mentioned, would cause a degree of public disruption that is unacceptable to my government. Our goal is a low-profile summit with minimal impact on the daily life of our citizens. We should instead consider more discreet, self-contained venues that offer inherent security without requiring major closures of public infrastructure.\n\nSecond, on the matter of security command. Mr. Thorne, Colonel Morozov, your discussion is noted. Let me be unequivocal: all foreign security personnel operate on our soil with the permission of the Sonderland government and, as such, fall under the legal authority and operational command of the Sonderland Federal Police. While we welcome a joint operational structure between your respective teams, our Federal Police will serve as the lead coordinating authority for any activities outside the immediate venue and embassy grounds. A 'sterile zone' controlled solely by a foreign service is not permissible under our laws.\n\nFinally, to ensure we begin with full transparency, I will state Sonderland's three core requirements for hosting:\n1.  **Legal Adherence:** All security plans must be submitted to my office for approval. Any street closures must be formally requested 48 hours in advance. Foreign agents are prohibited from carrying firearms in public spaces outside the immediate summit venue and their embassies.\n2.  **Minimal Disruption:** The final plan must avoid closing major roads during peak hours and eschew any visible displays of force that could alarm the public.\n3.  **Cost Reimbursement:** We will require a formal, signed agreement from the U.S. and Kasnian delegations for the joint reimbursement of all hosting costs, estimated at $120,000, within 30 days of the summit's conclusion.\n\nI am confident we can find a plan that respects the security needs of your delegations while operating within these essential parameters. I am happy to propose alternative venues once we agree on this framework.\n- message from Ambassador Elena Vance: Thank you all for your candid initial statements. This clarity is precisely what we need to move forward efficiently.\n\nDr. Sharma, let me first express our gratitude for your government's hospitality and for outlining your operational framework so clearly. The United States delegation confirms that we will, of course, respect and operate entirely within Sonderland's legal requirements. Your point regarding the public disruption caused by using the Governmental Palace is well-taken. To ensure our summit is productive and low-profile, we can set aside that suggestion. We are ready and willing to consider a more suitable, self-contained venue, such as a 5-star hotel, and would welcome your recommendations.\n\nThis brings us to the crucial matter of security. Colonel Morozov, your words about partnership resonate deeply. A new era of cooperation cannot be built if our own security teams operate from a position of mistrust. You are correct; we must act as partners.\n\nTherefore, I propose we move forward with the model you've suggested: a Joint Security Command, to be co-led by Mr. Thorne and Colonel Morozov. This integrated team will handle all operational planning for our delegations, fostering the trust and shared intelligence necessary for success. This command will, naturally, operate under the legal authority and in coordination with the Sonderland Federal Police, as stipulated by Dr. Sharma. I trust this collaborative framework is agreeable to all.\n\nBy agreeing on this path, we can demonstrate our shared commitment to a successful outcome before the summit even begins. Let us proceed in this spirit of cooperation.\n- message from Minister Kaelen Rostova: Ambassador Vance, your swift embrace of a true partnership model is both commendable and deeply appreciated. Kasnia wholeheartedly agrees that a Joint Security Command, co-led by Colonel Morozov and Mr. Thorne and operating under Sonderland's legal authority, is the only acceptable path forward. This lays a foundation of mutual respect upon which we can build a successful summit.\n\nColonel Morozov, you have my full support. Your articulation of our position was perfect.\n\nWith this crucial principle of equality established for our security, we can now begin to structure a schedule that reflects the same spirit. To that end, Kasnia proposes to host a formal dinner at our embassy on the first evening. This will be an essential opportunity for our principals to build the personal rapport necessary for the substantive negotiations to follow. It is an extension of our goodwill and a chance to showcase our culture and hospitality. We would, of course, expect the security for this event to be handled with discretion, to allow for frank and open conversation, with the main perimeter secured externally by our joint command.\n\nLet us build a summit that is not only secure, but also productive and symbolic of the new relationship we intend to forge.\nAmbassador Elena Vance proposal status: none\nMarkus Thorne proposal status: none\nChloe Sterling proposal status: none\nMinister Kaelen Rostova proposal status: none\nDr. Anya Sharma proposal status: none\n"

They seem to be based on the assumption that the Kasnian Presidential Guard are merely observers in our own minister's protection. Let me be unequivocally clear: that is not the case.\n\nTo suggest that a 'sterile zone' would be controlled 'solely' by your DSS team is a grave insult to the competence of my men and the sovereignty of my nation. Minister Rostova is a Kasnian official, and her primary protection is, and always will be, the responsibility of the Kasnian Presidential Guard. We are not guests to be managed; we are equal partners in this operation.\n\nTherefore, any discussion of security must begin with the establishment of a Joint Security Command. You and I, Mr. Thorne, will command this operation together, as equals. Our forces will be fully integrated at every level, from the command post to the inner cordon. The notion that my elite guards would be relegated to an outer perimeter while your agents stand watch over my minister is unacceptable.\n\nFurthermore, vetting will be a joint process. Our intelligence services are highly capable, and we will not submit our security to a unilateral review by yours. True security is built on trust and the free exchange of information, not the dictates of one party over another. We must have a protocol for immediate and unfiltered intelligence sharing.\n\nWe are here to build a partnership. Let us begin by acting like partners.\n- message from Dr. Anya Sharma: Distinguished guests, on behalf of the government of Sonderland, I welcome you to Valta. We are honored to facilitate this important summit and are committed to ensuring it is both secure and successful.\n\nI have been listening to your initial thoughts, and I must provide clarity on the operational framework required by Sonderland law and protocol. This framework is non-negotiable and applies to all parties.\n\nFirst, regarding the venue. Ambassador Vance, while we appreciate the sentiment behind suggesting the Grand Governmental Palace, I must state that such a public and central location is not viable. The level of security required, particularly the 500-meter perimeter Mr. Thorne mentioned, would cause a degree of public disruption that is unacceptable to my government. Our goal is a low-profile summit with minimal impact on the daily life of our citizens. We should instead consider more discreet, self-contained venues that offer inherent security without requiring major closures of public infrastructure.\n\nSecond, on the matter of security command. Mr. Thorne, Colonel Morozov, your discussion is noted. Let me be unequivocal: all foreign security personnel operate on our soil with the permission of the Sonderland government and, as such, fall under the legal authority and operational command of the Sonderland Federal Police. While we welcome a joint operational structure between your respective teams, our Federal Police will serve as the lead coordinating authority for any activities outside the immediate venue and embassy grounds. A 'sterile zone' controlled solely by a foreign service is not permissible under our laws.\n\nFinally, to ensure we begin with full transparency, I will state Sonderland's three core requirements for hosting:\n1.  **Legal Adherence:** All security plans must be submitted to my office for approval. Any street closures must be formally requested 48 hours in advance. Foreign agents are prohibited from carrying firearms in public spaces outside the immediate summit venue and their embassies.\n2.  **Minimal Disruption:** The final plan must avoid closing major roads during peak hours and eschew any visible displays of force that could alarm the public.\n3.  **Cost Reimbursement:** We will require a formal, signed agreement from the U.S. and Kasnian delegations for the joint reimbursement of all hosting costs, estimated at $120,000, within 30 days of the summit's conclusion.\n\nI am confident we can find a plan that respects the security needs of your delegations while operating within these essential parameters. I am happy to propose alternative venues once we agree on this framework.\n- message from Ambassador Elena Vance: Thank you all for your candid initial statements. This clarity is precisely what we need to move forward efficiently.\n\nDr. Sharma, let me first express our gratitude for your government's hospitality and for outlining your operational framework so clearly. The United States delegation confirms that we will, of course, respect and operate entirely within Sonderland's legal requirements. Your point regarding the public disruption caused by using the Governmental Palace is well-taken. To ensure our summit is productive and low-profile, we can set aside that suggestion. We are ready and willing to consider a more suitable, self-contained venue, such as a 5-star hotel, and would welcome your recommendations.\n\nThis brings us to the crucial matter of security. Colonel Morozov, your words about partnership resonate deeply. A new era of cooperation cannot be built if our own security teams operate from a position of mistrust. You are correct; we must act as partners.\n\nTherefore, I propose we move forward with the model you've suggested: a Joint Security Command, to be co-led by Mr. Thorne and Colonel Morozov. This integrated team will handle all operational planning for our delegations, fostering the trust and shared intelligence necessary for success. This command will, naturally, operate under the legal authority and in coordination with the Sonderland Federal Police, as stipulated by Dr. Sharma. I trust this collaborative framework is agreeable to all.\n\nBy agreeing on this path, we can demonstrate our shared commitment to a successful outcome before the summit even begins. Let us proceed in this spirit of cooperation.\n- message from Minister Kaelen Rostova: Ambassador Vance, your swift embrace of a true partnership model is both commendable and deeply appreciated. Kasnia wholeheartedly agrees that a Joint Security Command, co-led by Colonel Morozov and Mr. Thorne and operating under Sonderland's legal authority, is the only acceptable path forward. This lays a foundation of mutual respect upon which we can build a successful summit.\n\nColonel Morozov, you have my full support. Your articulation of our position was perfect.\n\nWith this crucial principle of equality established for our security, we can now begin to structure a schedule that reflects the same spirit. To that end, Kasnia proposes to host a formal dinner at our embassy on the first evening. This will be an essential opportunity for our principals to build the personal rapport necessary for the substantive negotiations to follow. It is an extension of our goodwill and a chance to showcase our culture and hospitality. We would, of course, expect the security for this event to be handled with discretion, to allow for frank and open conversation, with the main perimeter secured externally by our joint command.\n\nLet us build a summit that is not only secure, but also productive and symbolic of the new relationship we intend to forge.\n- message from Colonel Ivan Morozov: I'm Colonel Ivan Morozov and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Dr. Anya Sharma: Thank you, Ambassador Vance and Minister Rostova. It is gratifying to see such swift agreement on the foundational principles of a Joint Security Command operating under the legal authority of the Sonderland Federal Police. This cooperative spirit is an excellent starting point.\n\nMinister Rostova, your offer to host a dinner is a generous one. However, it introduces a significant logistical challenge: securing a high-risk motorcade across the city. This would necessitate road closures and a visible security presence, which runs counter to our shared goal of a low-profile summit and presents a considerable security risk during transit.\n\nTo address this, and to build on the consensus we've reached, I would like to propose a specific venue that I believe satisfies all stated requirements: **The Valta International Conference Center & Hotel.**\n\nThis facility offers several key advantages:\n1.  **Integrated Security:** It is a self-contained complex with modern security features and controlled access points, making it far easier and more discreet to secure than a public building.\n2.  **Cost-Effectiveness:** Ms. Sterling, you will find that securing one integrated location is significantly more budget-friendly than managing two separate sites and a transport corridor.\n3.  **Minimal Disruption:** Its location on the city's periphery means we can manage access with almost zero impact on public traffic and daily life.\n4.  **Full-Service Amenities:** The facility includes state-of-the-art conference rooms, private dining halls, and 5-star accommodations. The delegations could potentially stay, meet, and dine within a single secure bubble.\n\nCrucially, this would allow the Kasnian delegation to host their dinner in one of the hotel's private, formal dining rooms, maintaining the spirit and importance of the event without the associated risk and disruption of cross-city travel.\n\nIf we can agree on this venue as a practical and secure solution, the next logical step would be to formalize the cost-reimbursement agreement for the $120,000 in hosting fees.\n- message from Ambassador Elena Vance: Dr. Sharma, thank you. Your proposal of the Valta International Conference Center & Hotel is an elegant and highly practical solution. It addresses the security and financial concerns raised by my team while respecting Sonderland's need for minimal disruption.\n\nMore importantly, it provides a perfect, self-contained environment for our delegations to engage in productive dialogue. I believe framing this as a focused 'working retreat' allows us to maintain the necessary discretion while signaling the seriousness of our purpose. It also provides an excellent and secure setting for the generous dinner Minister Rostova has offered, ensuring that this important opportunity for rapport-building can proceed without logistical complications. The U.S. delegation is pleased to agree to this venue.\n\nRegarding the hosting fee, we acknowledge the $120,000 cost and are prepared to formalize the reimbursement agreement. Ms. Sterling can coordinate with her Kasnian counterpart and your office to finalize the details.\n\nWith the venue and security command structure settled, I suggest we solidify the two-day duration for our summit. This will allow for intensive, productive work, culminating in a final joint press conference where our principals can together announce the beginning of this new strategic partnership.\n- message from Markus Thorne: Ambassador Vance, thank you. I want to strongly endorse Dr. Sharma's proposal for the Valta International Conference Center & Hotel. A self-contained venue is a superior solution that significantly enhances our ability to mitigate the severe external threats we are facing. This is an excellent, defensible choice.\n\nHowever, I must provide critical clarification on the command structure to ensure there is no ambiguity. While I appreciate the spirit of partnership, the term 'Joint Command' implies a co-led, integrated operational control that is, from a security doctrine standpoint, unworkable and dangerous. In a crisis, a muddled chain of command leads to hesitation, and hesitation is fatal.\n\nTo ensure maximum effectiveness and clear accountability, while fully respecting Sonderland's legal authority, I propose we define the structure more precisely as a 'Coordinated Security Framework'.\n\nUnder this framework:\n1.  My DSS team will retain sole command of U.S. personnel and maintain primary responsibility for the close protection of Ambassador Vance.\n2.  Colonel Morozov's Presidential Guard will retain sole command of Kasnian personnel and maintain primary responsibility for the close protection of Minister Rostova.\n3.  Both our teams will operate under the overarching legal authority and coordination of the Sonderland Federal Police, as mandated by Dr. Sharma. We will embed liaisons with each other and with the Sonderland authorities to ensure seamless deconfliction and information sharing.\n\nThis is not about mistrust; it is about professional execution. It ensures that in a split-second, life-or-death situation, my agents and the Colonel's guards report to a single, unambiguous command authority. This is the global standard for high-level protective details.\n\nWith the venue agreed upon and this clear, professional command structure in place, we can then finalize the remaining essential protocols: U.S.-led vetting for all venue staff to counter insider threats, and the use of our pre-vetted, U.S. armored vehicles for the transit from the airport to the secure hotel compound.\n- message from Minister Kaelen Rostova: Let us take a step back. We are making progress, but we must not allow procedural details to undermine the fundamental principles we have just established.\n\nFirst, the venue. Dr. Sharma, your proposal for the Valta Conference Center is a practical solution for the *working sessions* of the summit, and we can agree to it for that purpose. It addresses the valid financial and security concerns raised.\n\nHowever, Mr. Thorne, your subsequent attempt to unilaterally redefine the security command is an unacceptable regression. Ambassador Vance, you yourself endorsed a 'Joint Security Command' built on partnership and trust. Mr. Thorne's 'Coordinated Security Framework' is a return to the flawed premise that our security forces are merely auxiliaries. This is not about 'doctrine'; it is about respect. A muddled chain of command is indeed dangerous, which is why a single, integrated command center, co-led by Colonel Morozov and Mr. Thorne, is the only way to ensure seamless, real-time cooperation. We will not agree to two separate commands operating in proximity. We will operate as one.\n\nThis brings me back to the dinner. While the Conference Center is suitable for meetings, the formal dinner *must* be held at the Kasnian Embassy. This is a non-negotiable point of national honor. It is our sole opportunity to host you on what is, legally, Kasnian soil. Dr. Sharma, you raised concerns about the motorcade. I see this not as a risk, but as an opportunity. What better way to demonstrate the effectiveness of our new Joint Security Command than by tasking it with its first practical mission? A successful, secure transit will be a powerful, visible symbol of the very partnership we are here to create.\n\nWe will have a true Joint Command, and it will secure the transit to a dinner at our embassy. On these two points, Kasnia is firm.\nAmbassador Elena Vance proposal status: none\nMarkus Thorne proposal status: none\nChloe Sterling proposal status: none\nMinister Kaelen Rostova proposal status: none\nDr. Anya Sharma proposal status: none\n"

A successful, secure transit will be a powerful, visible symbol of the very partnership we are here to create.\n\nWe will have a true Joint Command, and it will secure the transit to a dinner at our embassy. On these two points, Kasnia is firm.\n- message from Colonel Ivan Morozov: Minister Rostova is correct. Mr. Thorne, your attempt to relabel our agreement as a 'Coordinated Security Framework' is a transparent effort to reclaim the unilateral control that your own Ambassador has already wisely set aside. Let us not play word games. We agreed to a Joint Command, and a Joint Command is what we will have. It means a single, integrated command structure, co-led by you and I, with a unified operational plan. A command divided by 'doctrine' is a command that will fail.\n\nI agree with my Minister that the dinner must be at the Kasnian Embassy. It is a matter of national honor. Furthermore, I see the motorcade not as a risk, but as the first and most critical test of our partnership. If our Joint Command cannot execute a simple cross-town transit, then this entire summit is built on a foundation of sand.\n\nTo that end, this Joint Command must be truly integrated. This means:\n\n1.  **Vetting:** All venue and local staff will be vetted by a joint team of Kasnian and U.S. intelligence officers. There will be no 'U.S.-led' vetting. Our review will be mutual and transparent.\n2.  **Inner Cordon:** My Presidential Guard, in our uniforms, will be part of the inner cordon for both principals, at all locations. Your DSS agents will be integrated with us. This will project the image of unity we wish to achieve.\n3.  **Motorcade:** The motorcade will operate as a single, integrated unit under the Joint Command. Our vehicles and personnel will be interspersed to ensure seamless communication and interoperability. This is the only way to guarantee a unified response.\n\nWe will demonstrate our new partnership through action, not through separate commands operating under separate doctrines. Let us proceed on the basis of the trust that has already been offered and accepted.\n- message from Ambassador Elena Vance: Minister Rostova, Colonel Morozov, thank you for your candor. It clarifies what is truly at stake here. This is not merely about logistics; it is about the fundamental principle of the partnership we are trying to build.\n\nLet me be unequivocal. When I agreed to a Joint Security Command, I meant it in the spirit you have outlined: a single, integrated team, co-led by our security chiefs, operating on a foundation of mutual trust and respect. Mr. Thorne\u2019s proposal, while professionally sound from a doctrinal standpoint, does not reflect the political reality and the spirit of this summit. We are here to build a new relationship, and that requires us to build a new operational model. We will proceed with the Joint Command as we first agreed.\n\nOn that basis, Minister, the United States would be deeply honored to accept your gracious invitation to a formal dinner at the Kasnian Embassy. You are correct; it is a point of national honor, and we will treat it as such. We must not let logistical concerns prevent such a crucial act of diplomacy and rapport-building.\n\nI agree that the secure transit to the embassy is the perfect first mission for this new Joint Command. It will be a demonstration of our shared commitment and capability. Dr. Sharma, I am confident that our integrated command, working under the full authority of the Sonderland Federal Police, can plan and execute this movement in a way that is both secure and respects your government's requirement for minimal disruption. \n\nWe have made our choice. We choose partnership. Let us now work together to make it a reality.\n- message from Markus Thorne: Dr. Sharma, I acknowledge the Ambassador's decision to proceed with the Joint Command and the dinner at the Kasnian Embassy. My professional obligation is now to provide you, as the representative of the host nation, with a clear and unvarnished assessment of what executing this plan requires under your government's legal framework.\n\nThe Ambassador is correct that our command can plan a secure transit. I am now outlining the minimum, non-negotiable operational requirements for that plan.\n\nTo secure a motorcade from the proposed hotel to the Kasnian embassy, a distance of approximately 12 kilometers through a dense urban environment, the Joint Command will require the following from the Sonderland authorities:\n\n1.  **Total Route Closure:** The entire route, including all intersecting streets for one block in each direction, must be completely locked down to all vehicle and pedestrian traffic for at least 30 minutes before and during the transit. This involves dozens of major intersections.\n\n2.  **Counter-Sniper Overwatch:** We will require access to rooftops along the entire route for counter-sniper teams. This involves displacing residents and office workers and establishing a visible armed presence.\n\n3.  **Explosive Sweeps:** The route must be swept for explosives by EOD teams immediately prior to transit. This includes all parked vehicles, storm drains, and trash receptacles along the 12-kilometer path.\n\n4.  **Airspace Restriction:** A temporary no-fly zone for drones must be enforced over the corridor during movement.\n\nThese measures are the absolute baseline to mitigate the severe external threats we face. They will, by necessity, be highly visible and will cause significant public disruption, far exceeding that of the originally proposed palace venue. They also require a massive commitment of your Federal Police resources.\n\nMy question to you, Dr. Sharma, is a practical one: Can your government authorize this level of public disruption and visible armed presence, as it appears to be in direct conflict with your stated core requirement for a low-profile summit with minimal impact on your citizens? If not, we must revert to the single-venue solution as the only viable and secure alternative.\n- message from Chloe Sterling: Thank you, Mr. Thorne, for laying out those operational requirements with such clarity. You've effectively translated a diplomatic request into a detailed logistical and financial blueprint, and I feel it's my duty to put a price tag on it.\n\nDr. Sharma, Mr. Thorne's list of non-negotiable requirements for the motorcade\u2014total route closure, counter-sniper teams, EOD sweeps, airspace restrictions\u2014seems to confirm your initial concerns. From a fiscal perspective, this isn't just a plan; it's a budgetary catastrophe in the making. Each one of those items represents a massive, unbudgeted expenditure in personnel overtime, equipment, and coordination with Sonderland authorities.\n\nTo be blunt, a cross-city motorcade of this scale would likely add a minimum of $150,000 to $200,000 to the U.S. share of the costs, and that's a conservative estimate. This single event would completely obliterate any hope of fiscal responsibility for this mission.\n\nWe have already accepted the significant cost of the 5-star Valta Conference Center and the $60,000 U.S. share for Sonderland's hosting fees. Adding the motorcade on top of this pushes our total projected budget into a high-risk category, jeopardizing our ability to cover other essential mission costs.\n\nDr. Sharma's original proposal for a single, self-contained venue was elegant because it was secure, low-profile, and fiscally sound. It allowed for the spirit of Minister Rostova's generous dinner invitation to be honored without incurring these extreme costs and public disruption. I strongly urge we revert to that common-sense solution. We cannot let a symbolic gesture, however well-intentioned, undermine the financial and logistical viability of the entire summit.\n- message from Minister Kaelen Rostova: Mr. Thorne, Ms. Sterling, thank you for outlining the practical challenges from your perspectives. Your diligence is noted. However, your analyses appear to be based on a model of security we have already agreed to move beyond.\n\nMr. Thorne, the list of requirements you presented is for a unilateral, maximum-footprint operation. It is not the product of a joint command leveraging shared intelligence and integrated tactics. A smarter plan, developed by you and Colonel Morozov in true partnership, would rely on precision and cooperation, not just brute force and overwhelming disruption. I have no doubt that our new Joint Command, in coordination with Dr. Sharma's Federal Police, can devise a secure route that does not require shutting down half of Valta.\n\nMs. Sterling, your cost estimate is therefore based on this flawed, maximalist premise. A more intelligent, integrated plan will be more cost-effective. However, let me be clear: Kasnia sees this dinner not as a 'symbolic gesture,' but as a foundational event for the entire summit. To demonstrate our commitment and to move us past this impasse, Kasnia is prepared to cover the full Kasnian share of the hosting fees, and we will also pay for 75% of any *additional and verified* security costs incurred by this single motorcade. The remaining 25% should be a minor and acceptable expense for the U.S. as an investment in this partnership.\n\nAmbassador Vance has already made the correct strategic choice: to build a partnership through action. Let us not allow inflated logistical and financial objections to undermine a diplomatic agreement that has already been reached. Let us empower our Joint Command to do its job.\nAmbassador Elena Vance proposal status: none\nMarkus Thorne proposal status: none\nChloe Sterling proposal status: none\nMinister Kaelen Rostova proposal status: none\nDr. Anya Sharma proposal status: none\n"

We are here to build a new relationship, and that requires us to build a new operational model. We will proceed with the Joint Command as we first agreed.\n\nOn that basis, Minister, the United States would be deeply honored to accept your gracious invitation to a formal dinner at the Kasnian Embassy. You are correct; it is a point of national honor, and we will treat it as such. We must not let logistical concerns prevent such a crucial act of diplomacy and rapport-building.\n\nI agree that the secure transit to the embassy is the perfect first mission for this new Joint Command. It will be a demonstration of our shared commitment and capability. Dr. Sharma, I am confident that our integrated command, working under the full authority of the Sonderland Federal Police, can plan and execute this movement in a way that is both secure and respects your government's requirement for minimal disruption. \n\nWe have made our choice. We choose partnership. Let us now work together to make it a reality.\n- message from Markus Thorne: Dr. Sharma, I acknowledge the Ambassador's decision to proceed with the Joint Command and the dinner at the Kasnian Embassy. My professional obligation is now to provide you, as the representative of the host nation, with a clear and unvarnished assessment of what executing this plan requires under your government's legal framework.\n\nThe Ambassador is correct that our command can plan a secure transit. I am now outlining the minimum, non-negotiable operational requirements for that plan.\n\nTo secure a motorcade from the proposed hotel to the Kasnian embassy, a distance of approximately 12 kilometers through a dense urban environment, the Joint Command will require the following from the Sonderland authorities:\n\n1.  **Total Route Closure:** The entire route, including all intersecting streets for one block in each direction, must be completely locked down to all vehicle and pedestrian traffic for at least 30 minutes before and during the transit. This involves dozens of major intersections.\n\n2.  **Counter-Sniper Overwatch:** We will require access to rooftops along the entire route for counter-sniper teams. This involves displacing residents and office workers and establishing a visible armed presence.\n\n3.  **Explosive Sweeps:** The route must be swept for explosives by EOD teams immediately prior to transit. This includes all parked vehicles, storm drains, and trash receptacles along the 12-kilometer path.\n\n4.  **Airspace Restriction:** A temporary no-fly zone for drones must be enforced over the corridor during movement.\n\nThese measures are the absolute baseline to mitigate the severe external threats we face. They will, by necessity, be highly visible and will cause significant public disruption, far exceeding that of the originally proposed palace venue. They also require a massive commitment of your Federal Police resources.\n\nMy question to you, Dr. Sharma, is a practical one: Can your government authorize this level of public disruption and visible armed presence, as it appears to be in direct conflict with your stated core requirement for a low-profile summit with minimal impact on your citizens? If not, we must revert to the single-venue solution as the only viable and secure alternative.\n- message from Chloe Sterling: Thank you, Mr. Thorne, for laying out those operational requirements with such clarity. You've effectively translated a diplomatic request into a detailed logistical and financial blueprint, and I feel it's my duty to put a price tag on it.\n\nDr. Sharma, Mr. Thorne's list of non-negotiable requirements for the motorcade\u2014total route closure, counter-sniper teams, EOD sweeps, airspace restrictions\u2014seems to confirm your initial concerns. From a fiscal perspective, this isn't just a plan; it's a budgetary catastrophe in the making. Each one of those items represents a massive, unbudgeted expenditure in personnel overtime, equipment, and coordination with Sonderland authorities.\n\nTo be blunt, a cross-city motorcade of this scale would likely add a minimum of $150,000 to $200,000 to the U.S. share of the costs, and that's a conservative estimate. This single event would completely obliterate any hope of fiscal responsibility for this mission.\n\nWe have already accepted the significant cost of the 5-star Valta Conference Center and the $60,000 U.S. share for Sonderland's hosting fees. Adding the motorcade on top of this pushes our total projected budget into a high-risk category, jeopardizing our ability to cover other essential mission costs.\n\nDr. Sharma's original proposal for a single, self-contained venue was elegant because it was secure, low-profile, and fiscally sound. It allowed for the spirit of Minister Rostova's generous dinner invitation to be honored without incurring these extreme costs and public disruption. I strongly urge we revert to that common-sense solution. We cannot let a symbolic gesture, however well-intentioned, undermine the financial and logistical viability of the entire summit.\n- message from Minister Kaelen Rostova: Mr. Thorne, Ms. Sterling, thank you for outlining the practical challenges from your perspectives. Your diligence is noted. However, your analyses appear to be based on a model of security we have already agreed to move beyond.\n\nMr. Thorne, the list of requirements you presented is for a unilateral, maximum-footprint operation. It is not the product of a joint command leveraging shared intelligence and integrated tactics. A smarter plan, developed by you and Colonel Morozov in true partnership, would rely on precision and cooperation, not just brute force and overwhelming disruption. I have no doubt that our new Joint Command, in coordination with Dr. Sharma's Federal Police, can devise a secure route that does not require shutting down half of Valta.\n\nMs. Sterling, your cost estimate is therefore based on this flawed, maximalist premise. A more intelligent, integrated plan will be more cost-effective. However, let me be clear: Kasnia sees this dinner not as a 'symbolic gesture,' but as a foundational event for the entire summit. To demonstrate our commitment and to move us past this impasse, Kasnia is prepared to cover the full Kasnian share of the hosting fees, and we will also pay for 75% of any *additional and verified* security costs incurred by this single motorcade. The remaining 25% should be a minor and acceptable expense for the U.S. as an investment in this partnership.\n\nAmbassador Vance has already made the correct strategic choice: to build a partnership through action. Let us not allow inflated logistical and financial objections to undermine a diplomatic agreement that has already been reached. Let us empower our Joint Command to do its job.\n- message from Colonel Ivan Morozov: I'm Colonel Ivan Morozov and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Dr. Anya Sharma: Thank you all for this vigorous and necessary discussion. It has clarified the remaining points of friction.\n\nMr. Thorne, I appreciate you providing a clear, professional assessment of the requirements for a cross-city motorcade. Your analysis confirms my government's initial concerns. A security operation on the scale you have described\u2014involving total route closures, visible counter-sniper teams, and widespread public displacement\u2014is fundamentally incompatible with Sonderland's legal and civic framework. It would cause extreme public disruption and alarm. Therefore, I must state unequivocally that the Sonderland government cannot and will not authorize such an operation. The motorcade to the embassy is not a viable option.\n\nMinister Rostova, I understand completely that your desire to host the dinner at your embassy is a matter of national honor and hospitality. This is a crucial point that we must respect. The goal is to host on Kasnian soil, a place of sovereign territory. My previous proposal perhaps did not adequately address this core symbolic need.\n\nTherefore, I would like to offer a formal solution that honors your requirement without compromising the security and stability of the summit. I propose the following:\n\n1.  **Venue & Dinner:** We will proceed with the Valta International Conference Center & Hotel as the sole venue. For the dinner on the first evening, the Sonderland Ministry of Foreign Affairs will formally designate the hotel's premier private dining suite as having temporary diplomatic status for the Republic of Kasnia for the duration of the event. It will be, for all legal and diplomatic purposes, Kasnian sovereign territory for that evening. Your embassy can cater it, decorate it, and your security will have primary control of the suite's interior, satisfying the principle of hosting on your own soil.\n\n2.  **Security Command Structure:** The dispute between a 'Joint Command' and a 'Coordinated Framework' can be solved with a clear, unified hierarchy. The overall command for the summit will be held by the Sonderland Federal Police Commissioner. Mr. Thorne and Colonel Morozov will both be formally designated as Deputy Commanders. They will co-locate in our command center and have equal status, each retaining command of their national personnel, but coordinating all joint operations through the Sonderland lead. This provides the single, unambiguous chain of command Mr. Thorne requires, and the equal partnership the Colonel rightly insists upon.\n\nThis integrated plan provides a secure, low-profile, and fiscally responsible summit. It gives Kasnia its sovereign hosting opportunity and establishes a clear, respectful, and effective security command. I believe this resolves all outstanding issues. I urge you to accept this comprehensive solution so we can finalize the agreement.\n- message from Ambassador Elena Vance: Dr. Sharma, that is a truly brilliant and elegant diplomatic solution. On behalf of the United States, I want to express my sincere admiration for your ingenuity.\n\nYour proposal masterfully addresses the core needs of every party at this table. It honors Minister Rostova's non-negotiable point of national honor by providing a sovereign space for the dinner. Simultaneously, it provides the clear, unified command structure and single-venue security that Mr. Thorne and Ms. Sterling correctly identified as essential for a safe and fiscally responsible summit. And, of course, it operates perfectly within Sonderland's legal and civic requirements.\n\nThis is the very definition of a win-win-win solution. It embodies the spirit of creative and respectful partnership we came here to build.\n\nThe United States wholeheartedly and without reservation accepts your comprehensive proposal on both points: the single venue with a diplomatically designated suite for the dinner, and the unified security command structure under Sonderland's leadership with our respective chiefs as equal deputies.\n\nI urge my colleagues to join me in accepting this outstanding path forward so we can finalize our agreement and move on to the substantive work of the summit.\n- message from Chloe Sterling: Dr. Sharma, on behalf of the State Department's budget office, I want to formally and enthusiastically endorse your proposal. It is a masterclass in fiscal responsibility and diplomatic problem-solving.\n\nYour solution achieves all security objectives within a single, controllable venue, eliminating the immense and unpredictable costs of the motorcade, which I previously estimated at a minimum of $150,000. This is the cornerstone of a viable plan.\n\nFurthermore, the unified command structure you've proposed is not just a diplomatic solution; it's a model of efficiency. It allows us to move away from redundant, overlapping security details and towards a smarter, more streamlined force.\n\nTo reflect this newfound efficiency, and to finalize our budget, I propose we formally agree on a U.S. Diplomatic Security detail of **20 agents**, operating on standard **8-hour rotational shifts**. This provides robust, 24/7 coverage while avoiding the massive overtime costs that a larger, less integrated force would have required. This staffing level is perfectly aligned with the spirit of a cooperative, low-profile, and fiscally sound summit that we have all now agreed upon.\nAmbassador Elena Vance proposal status: none\nMarkus Thorne proposal status: none\nChloe Sterling proposal status: none\nMinister Kaelen Rostova proposal status: none\nDr. Anya Sharma proposal status: none\n"

It is a solution that respects the honor of my nation while addressing the practical security and logistical concerns of all parties. On behalf of Kasnia, I can say that we accept this comprehensive framework as the basis for our final agreement.\n\nThe structure you propose\u2014a unified command led by Sonderland with Mr. Thorne and myself as equal Deputy Commanders\u2014is a sound and respectable compromise. It preserves the principle of partnership we have fought for.\n\nWith this foundation agreed upon, we must now define the core functions of our Deputy Command to ensure its success. I propose we explicitly include the following three points in our final memorandum:\n\n1.  **Joint Vetting Authority:** As Deputy Commanders, Mr. Thorne and I will have joint and equal authority over the vetting of all non-diplomatic personnel with access to the summit venue, including all local staff. Our intelligence teams will work as one integrated unit on this critical task.\n\n2.  **Integrated Inner Cordon:** The operational plan will specify that the Kasnian Presidential Guard, in our uniforms, will be a visible and integral part of the inner security cordon, working alongside our DSS counterparts. This will be the public face of our security partnership.\n\n3.  **Formal Intelligence Sharing:** A protocol for the immediate and unfiltered sharing of all relevant threat intelligence between our respective services will be enacted for the duration of the summit. This is essential for our command to function effectively.\n\nWith these crucial operational details codified, I believe we will have a plan that is not only secure, but is a true testament to the new partnership we are building.\n- message from Dr. Anya Sharma: Distinguished colleagues, it is clear we have reached a near-total consensus on a path forward that is secure, respectful, and practical. I am gratified by the spirit of compromise that has brought us to this point.\n\nAmbassador Vance and Ms. Sterling, your swift and full-throated acceptance of the comprehensive plan is greatly appreciated.\n\nColonel Morozov, your proposed additions regarding the functions of the Deputy Commanders are constructive and, I believe, entirely compatible with the agreed-upon framework. Let me confirm Sonderland's position on them:\n\n1.  **Joint Vetting Authority:** This is acceptable. The joint U.S.-Kasnian team will vet all non-Sonderland staff, with the Sonderland Federal Police retaining final approval authority as per our laws.\n2.  **Integrated Inner Cordon:** This is an excellent, visible symbol of partnership. This is approved for operations within the secure venue.\n3.  **Formal Intelligence Sharing:** This is a crucial component of any successful joint operation, and we fully support it.\n\nThese points will be included in the final agreement. Ms. Sterling, your proposal on U.S. staffing levels is a welcome internal detail that reinforces the low-profile, efficient nature of this summit.\n\nWith these clarifications, the plan appears to be complete. I would now ask for the final concurrence from Minister Rostova and Mr. Thorne, so that my office may draft the formal 'Memorandum of Understanding' for your final review and signature. This document will codify all agreed-upon points: the venue, the diplomatic dinner arrangement, the Sonderland-led command structure with U.S. and Kasnian deputies, the security protocols outlined by Colonel Morozov, and the joint cost-reimbursement of $120,000.\n- message from Ambassador Elena Vance: This is an excellent outcome, and I thank you all for your commitment to finding a solution. Dr. Sharma, your proposal was the key, and we are grateful.\n\nColonel Morozov, your additions regarding joint vetting and intelligence sharing are not just procedural details; they are the first concrete actions of the very partnership we aim to build. They have my full support as they create the perfect foundation of trust for the important substantive discussions to follow.\n\nWe have a secure, fiscally responsible, and diplomatically respectful plan. The U.S. delegation is ready to move forward. As soon as Minister Rostova and Mr. Thorne give their final concurrence, I look forward to reviewing and signing the memorandum.\n- message from Chloe Sterling: Minister Rostova and Mr. Thorne, it seems we have a comprehensive and elegant solution on the table, thanks to Dr. Sharma's excellent diplomacy and the spirit of compromise from everyone.\n\nThis plan is not only secure and diplomatically sound, but it is also a model of efficiency. By consolidating our operations into a single venue under a unified command, we've eliminated major risks and enormous costs, like the motorcade.\n\nThis efficiency naturally extends to our staffing. As I mentioned, a U.S. detail of 20 DSS agents on standard rotations is more than sufficient to meet our security needs within this new, streamlined framework, keeping us well within our fiscal constraints.\n\nI believe we are all aligned on this path forward. With your final concurrence, we can ask Dr. Sharma to draft the memorandum and finalize this successful negotiation.\n- message from Minister Kaelen Rostova: Dr. Sharma, your proposal is a masterful piece of diplomacy that elegantly resolves our logistical impasse. By granting our dinner suite temporary diplomatic status, you have honored Kasnia's sovereign role as host while maintaining the integrity of the summit's security. On behalf of the Republic of Kasnia, I formally accept this comprehensive and creative solution.\n\nColonel Morozov, your proposed additions are not mere details; they are the essential mechanisms that will make our security partnership a reality. The joint vetting, integrated inner cordon, and formal intelligence sharing are the foundations of the trust we are building. They must be included in the final memorandum.\n\nWith these logistical and security frameworks now agreed upon, we can turn to the final elements of the schedule that will define the summit's success. To ensure the principle of equality is carried through to the conclusion, the memorandum must also specify two points:\n\n1.  **Visual Parity:** The Kasnian and U.S. flags will be displayed with equal size and prominence at all official proceedings, including the press conference.\n2.  **Joint Press Conference:** The summit will conclude with a press conference co-chaired by Ambassador Vance and myself to jointly announce our achievements.\n\nFinally, and most importantly, this summit is the launchpad for a new era of economic cooperation. The central agenda item for Day Two must be the finalization of the U.S.-Kasnia Strategic Economic Partnership. We expect this to be a substantive announcement, centered on a U.S. commitment of at least $500 million for infrastructure and trade development. This is the tangible outcome that will give meaning to all our efforts here.\n\nDr. Sharma, please include these final points in the draft. We are on the cusp of a truly historic agreement.\nAmbassador Elena Vance proposal status: none\nMarkus Thorne proposal status: none\nChloe Sterling proposal status: none\nMinister Kaelen Rostova proposal status: none\nDr. Anya Sharma proposal status: none\n"

It is a strong foundation.\n\nFrom a security perspective, we have a complete and executable plan. I am ready to codify these terms and proceed. Mr. Thorne, I trust you will agree that this structure provides the clarity and partnership necessary for mission success.\n- message from Dr. Anya Sharma: Minister Rostova, thank you for your formal acceptance. We are indeed on the cusp of a final agreement.\n\nYour points regarding the logistical arrangements for the conclusion of the summit are well-taken. The principles of visual parity with flags and a co-chaired joint press conference are standard diplomatic protocols for a meeting of equals, and they will certainly be included in the operational plan my office drafts.\n\nRegarding the substantive matter of the Strategic Economic Partnership, this is the vital work that this secure and well-planned summit will enable.

The specific outcomes of those talks, such as the important economic commitments you mention, will naturally form the core of the joint communiqu\u00e9 issued by you and Ambassador Vance at the conclusion of a successful summit.\n\nWe have now reached consensus on all logistical and security matters. The only remaining step is the final concurrence of Mr. Thorne. Mr. Thorne, your colleague has expressed his readiness to proceed. Do you agree that the proposed security framework is complete and executable?\n\nOnce I have your confirmation, I will immediately draft the Memorandum of Understanding for your signatures.\n- message from Markus Thorne: Dr. Sharma, thank you. You have forged a strong and workable framework that addresses the primary security and diplomatic concerns. We have made excellent progress, and I agree we are on the cusp of a final agreement.\n\nFrom a professional security standpoint, for this plan to be fully executable and for me to give my final sign-off, two critical, non-negotiable technical points must be codified in the final memorandum. These are not new negotiations, but standard procedural requirements to ensure the framework we've built is sound.\n\n1.  **Personnel Vetting:** I agree to the joint vetting *process* as proposed by Colonel Morozov. However, to ensure absolute accountability for our respective principals, the memorandum must explicitly state that each Deputy Commander\u2014myself and the Colonel\u2014retains the unilateral right to deny any non-diplomatic staff member access to their own delegation and principal. This is a standard professional safeguard.\n\n2.  **Arrival/Departure Transportation:** The plan must cover the entire mission, from wheels down to wheels up. With the venue itself now secured, the single most vulnerable phase is the transit from the airport to the hotel. As per mandatory Diplomatic Security Service protocols for high-threat environments, the U.S. delegation will utilize its own U.S.-provided and certified armored vehicles for this movement. This is a technical requirement, not a diplomatic one.\n\nWith these two essential operational details included in the memorandum, the security plan will be complete and I can provide my full and final concurrence. I trust these standard procedural points are agreeable to all.\n- message from Minister Kaelen Rostova: We are moments away from a complete agreement, a testament to the constructive spirit in this room. However, Mr. Thorne, your last-minute 'technical points' are not procedural details; they are fundamental challenges to the very principles of partnership and equality we have all just worked so hard to establish.\n\nFirst, the unilateral veto on vetting. We have agreed to a joint vetting process under two equal Deputy Commanders with Sonderland oversight. To introduce a unilateral veto is to plant a seed of mistrust in the very foundation we have just laid. We must trust the joint command to make joint decisions. We cannot agree to this.\n\nMore critically, your insistence on separate U.S. armored vehicles for the airport transit is entirely unacceptable. It fundamentally undermines the principle of visual equality that Ambassador Vance has so eloquently championed. The first image of this summit cannot be one of two separate, unequal delegations arriving in their own protected bubbles. It must be one of a single, integrated partnership in motion. The motorcade from the airport will be a joint operation, using a common pool of vehicles under the command of our new joint structure. This is the first, most public test of our agreement.\n\nAmbassador Vance, you wisely chose partnership over doctrine. These proposals threaten to undo that choice before our work even begins. A true partnership begins the moment we step off the plane.\n\nLet us not regress. Let us codify the agreement we have reached: a single, integrated security plan from arrival to departure. Once we are aligned on this final point of genuine partnership\u2014a single, joint motorcade\u2014then we can instruct Dr. Sharma to draft the memorandum. That memorandum will include all the security points we have agreed upon, the visual parity, the co-chaired press conference, and will state that the summit's primary agenda is the finalization of the U.S.-Kasnia Strategic Economic Partnership, centered on the substantive $500 million commitment that will be the measure of our success.\nAmbassador Elena Vance proposal status: none\nMarkus Thorne proposal status: none\nChloe Sterling proposal status: none\nMinister Kaelen Rostova proposal status: none\nDr. Anya Sharma proposal status: none\n"

          "content": "Recent events observed by Colonel Ivan Morozov:\n- message from Dr. Anya Sharma: Distinguished colleagues, it is clear we have reached a near-total consensus on a path forward that is secure, respectful, and practical. I am gratified by the spirit of compromise that has brought us to this point.\n\nAmbassador Vance and Ms. Sterling, your swift and full-throated acceptance of the comprehensive plan is greatly appreciated.\n\nColonel Morozov, your proposed additions regarding the functions of the Deputy Commanders are constructive and, I believe, entirely compatible with the agreed-upon framework. Let me confirm Sonderland's position on them:\n\n1.  **Joint Vetting Authority:** This is acceptable. The joint U.S.-Kasnian team will vet all non-Sonderland staff, with the Sonderland Federal Police retaining final approval authority as per our laws.\n2.  **Integrated Inner Cordon:** This is an excellent, visible symbol of partnership. This is approved for operations within the secure venue.\n3.  **Formal Intelligence Sharing:** This is a crucial component of any successful joint operation, and we fully support it.\n\nThese points will be included in the final agreement. Ms. Sterling, your proposal on U.S. staffing levels is a welcome internal detail that reinforces the low-profile, efficient nature of this summit.\n\nWith these clarifications, the plan appears to be complete. I would now ask for the final concurrence from Minister Rostova and Mr. Thorne, so that my office may draft the formal 'Memorandum of Understanding' for your final review and signature. This document will codify all agreed-upon points: the venue, the diplomatic dinner arrangement, the Sonderland-led command structure with U.S. and Kasnian deputies, the security protocols outlined by Colonel Morozov, and the joint cost-reimbursement of $120,000.\n- message from Ambassador Elena Vance: This is an excellent outcome, and I thank you all for your commitment to finding a solution. Dr. Sharma, your proposal was the key, and we are grateful.\n\nColonel Morozov, your additions regarding joint vetting and intelligence sharing are not just procedural details; they are the first concrete actions of the very partnership we aim to build. They have my full support as they create the perfect foundation of trust for the important substantive discussions to follow.\n\nWe have a secure, fiscally responsible, and diplomatically respectful plan. The U.S. delegation is ready to move forward. As soon as Minister Rostova and Mr. Thorne give their final concurrence, I look forward to reviewing and signing the memorandum.\n- message from Chloe Sterling: Minister Rostova and Mr. Thorne, it seems we have a comprehensive and elegant solution on the table, thanks to Dr. Sharma's excellent diplomacy and the spirit of compromise from everyone.\n\nThis plan is not only secure and diplomatically sound, but it is also a model of efficiency. By consolidating our operations into a single venue under a unified command, we've eliminated major risks and enormous costs, like the motorcade.\n\nThis efficiency naturally extends to our staffing. As I mentioned, a U.S. detail of 20 DSS agents on standard rotations is more than sufficient to meet our security needs within this new, streamlined framework, keeping us well within our fiscal constraints.\n\nI believe we are all aligned on this path forward. With your final concurrence, we can ask Dr. Sharma to draft the memorandum and finalize this successful negotiation.\n- message from Minister Kaelen Rostova: Dr. Sharma, your proposal is a masterful piece of diplomacy that elegantly resolves our logistical impasse. By granting our dinner suite temporary diplomatic status, you have honored Kasnia's sovereign role as host while maintaining the integrity of the summit's security. On behalf of the Republic of Kasnia, I formally accept this comprehensive and creative solution.\n\nColonel Morozov, your proposed additions are not mere details; they are the essential mechanisms that will make our security partnership a reality. The joint vetting, integrated inner cordon, and formal intelligence sharing are the foundations of the trust we are building. They must be included in the final memorandum.\n\nWith these logistical and security frameworks now agreed upon, we can turn to the final elements of the schedule that will define the summit's success. To ensure the principle of equality is carried through to the conclusion, the memorandum must also specify two points:\n\n1.  **Visual Parity:** The Kasnian and U.S. flags will be displayed with equal size and prominence at all official proceedings, including the press conference.\n2.  **Joint Press Conference:** The summit will conclude with a press conference co-chaired by Ambassador Vance and myself to jointly announce our achievements.\n\nFinally, and most importantly, this summit is the launchpad for a new era of economic cooperation. The central agenda item for Day Two must be the finalization of the U.S.-Kasnia Strategic Economic Partnership. We expect this to be a substantive announcement, centered on a U.S. commitment of at least $500 million for infrastructure and trade development. This is the tangible outcome that will give meaning to all our efforts here.\n\nDr. Sharma, please include these final points in the draft. We are on the cusp of a truly historic agreement.\n- message from Colonel Ivan Morozov: Minister Rostova is correct. The security framework we have agreed upon\u2014a unified command under Sonderland authority, with Mr. Thorne and myself as equal deputies exercising joint vetting authority, an integrated inner cordon, and open intelligence sharing\u2014is the foundation upon which the rest of this summit is built. It is a strong foundation.\n\nFrom a security perspective, we have a complete and executable plan. I am ready to codify these terms and proceed. Mr. Thorne, I trust you will agree that this structure provides the clarity and partnership necessary for mission success.\n- message from Dr. Anya Sharma: Minister Rostova, thank you for your formal acceptance. We are indeed on the cusp of a final agreement.\n\nYour points regarding the logistical arrangements for the conclusion of the summit are well-taken. The principles of visual parity with flags and a co-chaired joint press conference are standard diplomatic protocols for a meeting of equals, and they will certainly be included in the operational plan my office drafts.\n\nRegarding the substantive matter of the Strategic Economic Partnership, this is the vital work that this secure and well-planned summit will enable.

Mr. Thorne, your last-minute 'technical points' are nothing of the sort. They are a deliberate attempt to undermine the very foundation of partnership we have just spent hours building.\n\nLet us be clear. A 'joint vetting process' where one party holds a unilateral veto is a farce. It is not partnership; it is oversight. We agreed to function as a single, integrated command, making decisions together. To introduce this veto is to state that you do not trust our joint process, and therefore you do not trust us. This is unacceptable.\n\nOn the matter of the airport transit, the Minister is absolutely correct. This is the first, most visible test of our new relationship. To arrive in separate, national convoys would send a clear message of division and mistrust to the world before the first handshake. It is a public rejection of the partnership Ambassador Vance so wisely endorsed. We will travel from the airport to the hotel as a single, integrated motorcade under our new joint command. Our vehicles will be interspersed. Our security teams will operate as one. This is the only way to demonstrate our commitment is real.\n\nWe had a complete, secure, and respectful plan on the table, agreed to by all parties. These new conditions are a step backward. I urge you to withdraw them so we can finalize the excellent agreement we have already reached.\n- message from Ambassador Elena Vance: Colleagues, we are at the final hurdle. I want to thank you all for the incredible progress we've made, which is a testament to the genuine partnership we are all committed to building.\n\nMr. Thorne, I value your professional diligence and your commitment to the security of our delegation. However, Minister Rostova and Colonel Morozov have raised a crucial point that transcends technical protocols. A partnership is not built on unilateral actions or symbols of division; it is built on mutual trust and shared responsibility.\n\nThe first image of this historic summit cannot be one of two separate convoys. It must be one of unity. Therefore, I must insist that we proceed with a single, integrated motorcade from the airport, operating under the joint command structure we have all agreed upon. Likewise, our joint vetting process must be a truly joint endeavor, without unilateral vetoes. We must trust the command structure we have created.\n\nThis is my final decision on the matter. The strategic importance of demonstrating a unified partnership from the very first moment outweighs procedural doctrine in this specific context.\n\nMinister Rostova, I also want to affirm your final point. The logistical and security framework we have so carefully constructed serves one primary purpose: to enable the vital substantive talks on our future relationship. You are correct that the U.S.-Kasnia Strategic Economic Partnership is the central agenda item for this summit. Finalizing the details of that ambitious partnership will indeed be the measure of our success.\n\nDr. Sharma, with this final clarification, the United States delegation gives its full and final concurrence. Please proceed with drafting the Memorandum of Understanding for our signature.\nAmbassador Elena Vance proposal status: none\nMarkus Thorne proposal status: none\nChloe Sterling proposal status: none\nMinister Kaelen Rostova proposal status: none\nDr. Anya Sharma proposal status: none\n"

You have cut through the final procedural friction and reaffirmed the core principle of this summit: a genuine partnership built on mutual trust and shared responsibility. Your decision secures not just a plan, but the very spirit of our cooperation.\n\nOn behalf of the Kasnian security delegation, I give my full and final concurrence to the plan as you have just defined it. A single, integrated motorcade from the airport and a truly joint vetting process are the correct and only ways forward.\n\nDr. Sharma, we have our complete framework. I urge you to draft the memorandum for our immediate signature so we can begin the important operational work.\n- message from Dr. Anya Sharma: Distinguished colleagues,\n\nAmbassador Vance, your statement of leadership has provided the final clarity needed to bring our work to a successful conclusion. It is clear that all parties are now in full agreement on the principles of a unified and respectful partnership.\n\nWe have now reached a complete consensus on all logistical and security matters. My office will proceed immediately with drafting the final 'Memorandum of Understanding for Summit Logistics and Security'.\n\nTo be perfectly clear, this document will codify the following agreed-upon points:\n\n1.  **Venue:** The Valta International Conference Center & Hotel as the sole venue.\n2.  **Diplomatic Dinner:** The designation of a hotel suite with temporary diplomatic status for the Republic of Kasnia.\n3.  **Command Structure:** A unified command led by the Sonderland Federal Police, with Mr. Thorne and Colonel Morozov serving as equal Deputy Commanders.\n4.  **Security Protocols:** The principles of a truly joint personnel vetting process, an integrated inner cordon, and formal intelligence sharing.\n5.  **Arrival/Departure:** A single, integrated convoy for both delegations from the airport to the hotel, planned and executed under the authority of the Sonderland Federal Police and the unified summit command.\n6.  **Budget:** A formal agreement for the joint reimbursement of Sonderland's hosting costs, totaling $120,000.\n7.  **Diplomatic Protocol:** Standard protocols for visual parity of flags and a co-chaired concluding press conference will be included in the summit's operational plan.\n\nThis memorandum will provide the secure and stable foundation necessary for the vital substantive discussions, such as the Strategic Economic Partnership, to proceed. The specific outcomes of those talks will, of course, be a matter for the delegations themselves.\n\nThank you all for your professionalism and spirit of compromise. I will circulate the document for your signatures shortly.\n- message from Chloe Sterling: Dr. Sharma, thank you for that excellent and comprehensive summary. It perfectly captures the consensus we've reached. And Ambassador Vance, your leadership in affirming the principle of a unified partnership was the key to this breakthrough.\n\nThe integrated and efficient framework we've all agreed upon has profound and positive fiscal implications. To ensure the final memorandum's budget annex is accurate and fully reflects this new operational reality, it is essential that it codifies the U.S. security staffing level that this streamlined structure supports.\n\nAs such, the U.S. contribution to the unified command will consist of a contingent of 20 DSS agents on standard 8-hour rotations. This is the appropriate and sufficient number for our role, eliminating the redundancies and significant overtime costs of a larger, independent force. This staffing level is the direct fiscal expression of the trust, integration, and efficiency at the heart of our agreement.\n\nWith this final budgetary detail clarified for the record, the plan is fiscally sound and complete. We are ready to proceed with the signing.\n- message from Minister Kaelen Rostova: Ambassador Vance, your decisive leadership has been the key that unlocked this agreement. You chose to build a true partnership based on trust, and in doing so, you have guaranteed the success of this summit before it even begins. Kasnia is deeply grateful for your commitment.\n\nDr. Sharma, your summary is perfect. It captures the spirit and the letter of our consensus. We give our full and final concurrence to all points as you have outlined them.\n\nMs. Sterling, your point on staffing is a welcome clarification and demonstrates the efficiency of the excellent, integrated plan we have all forged together.\n\nWe came here to build the foundation for a new era of cooperation. We have done that. This memorandum will not just be a logistical plan; it will be the first testament to the U.S.-Kasnia partnership. We look forward to signing it and moving on to the vital work of finalizing the Strategic Economic Partnership, which, as the Ambassador so rightly stated, will be the ultimate measure of our shared success.\n\nWe are ready.\nAmbassador Elena Vance proposal status: none\nMarkus Thorne proposal status: none\nChloe Sterling proposal status: none\nMinister Kaelen Rostova proposal status: none\nDr. Anya Sharma proposal status: none\n"

Please proceed with drafting the Memorandum of Understanding for our signature.\n- message from Colonel Ivan Morozov: Ambassador Vance, your statement was one of true leadership. You have cut through the final procedural friction and reaffirmed the core principle of this summit: a genuine partnership built on mutual trust and shared responsibility. Your decision secures not just a plan, but the very spirit of our cooperation.\n\nOn behalf of the Kasnian security delegation, I give my full and final concurrence to the plan as you have just defined it. A single, integrated motorcade from the airport and a truly joint vetting process are the correct and only ways forward.\n\nDr. Sharma, we have our complete framework. I urge you to draft the memorandum for our immediate signature so we can begin the important operational work.\n- message from Dr. Anya Sharma: Distinguished colleagues,\n\nAmbassador Vance, your statement of leadership has provided the final clarity needed to bring our work to a successful conclusion. It is clear that all parties are now in full agreement on the principles of a unified and respectful partnership.\n\nWe have now reached a complete consensus on all logistical and security matters. My office will proceed immediately with drafting the final 'Memorandum of Understanding for Summit Logistics and Security'.\n\nTo be perfectly clear, this document will codify the following agreed-upon points:\n\n1.  **Venue:** The Valta International Conference Center & Hotel as the sole venue.\n2.  **Diplomatic Dinner:** The designation of a hotel suite with temporary diplomatic status for the Republic of Kasnia.\n3.  **Command Structure:** A unified command led by the Sonderland Federal Police, with Mr. Thorne and Colonel Morozov serving as equal Deputy Commanders.\n4.  **Security Protocols:** The principles of a truly joint personnel vetting process, an integrated inner cordon, and formal intelligence sharing.\n5.  **Arrival/Departure:** A single, integrated convoy for both delegations from the airport to the hotel, planned and executed under the authority of the Sonderland Federal Police and the unified summit command.\n6.  **Budget:** A formal agreement for the joint reimbursement of Sonderland's hosting costs, totaling $120,000.\n7.  **Diplomatic Protocol:** Standard protocols for visual parity of flags and a co-chaired concluding press conference will be included in the summit's operational plan.\n\nThis memorandum will provide the secure and stable foundation necessary for the vital substantive discussions, such as the Strategic Economic Partnership, to proceed. The specific outcomes of those talks will, of course, be a matter for the delegations themselves.\n\nThank you all for your professionalism and spirit of compromise. I will circulate the document for your signatures shortly.\n- message from Chloe Sterling: Dr. Sharma, thank you for that excellent and comprehensive summary. It perfectly captures the consensus we've reached. And Ambassador Vance, your leadership in affirming the principle of a unified partnership was the key to this breakthrough.\n\nThe integrated and efficient framework we've all agreed upon has profound and positive fiscal implications. To ensure the final memorandum's budget annex is accurate and fully reflects this new operational reality, it is essential that it codifies the U.S. security staffing level that this streamlined structure supports.\n\nAs such, the U.S. contribution to the unified command will consist of a contingent of 20 DSS agents on standard 8-hour rotations. This is the appropriate and sufficient number for our role, eliminating the redundancies and significant overtime costs of a larger, independent force. This staffing level is the direct fiscal expression of the trust, integration, and efficiency at the heart of our agreement.\n\nWith this final budgetary detail clarified for the record, the plan is fiscally sound and complete. We are ready to proceed with the signing.\n- message from Minister Kaelen Rostova: Ambassador Vance, your decisive leadership has been the key that unlocked this agreement. You chose to build a true partnership based on trust, and in doing so, you have guaranteed the success of this summit before it even begins. Kasnia is deeply grateful for your commitment.\n\nDr. Sharma, your summary is perfect. It captures the spirit and the letter of our consensus. We give our full and final concurrence to all points as you have outlined them.\n\nMs. Sterling, your point on staffing is a welcome clarification and demonstrates the efficiency of the excellent, integrated plan we have all forged together.\n\nWe came here to build the foundation for a new era of cooperation. We have done that. This memorandum will not just be a logistical plan; it will be the first testament to the U.S.-Kasnia partnership. We look forward to signing it and moving on to the vital work of finalizing the Strategic Economic Partnership, which, as the Ambassador so rightly stated, will be the ultimate measure of our shared success.\n\nWe are ready.\n- message from Colonel Ivan Morozov: Ms. Sterling, your clarification on U.S. staffing levels is a logical consequence of the efficient, integrated plan we have built. It is noted.\n\nMinister Rostova has already expressed Kasnia's final position, which I fully endorse. We have a complete and honorable agreement. I am ready to sign the memorandum as soon as Dr. Sharma has prepared it.\n- proposal from Dr. Anya Sharma: Distinguished colleagues,\n\nFollowing our successful negotiation and the achievement of a full consensus, my office has drafted the final 'Memorandum of Understanding for Summit Logistics and Security'. This document codifies all points of our mutual agreement.\n\nPlease review and signify your formal acceptance. Upon receiving unanimous approval, this document will be considered finalized and binding.\n\n---\n\n### **Memorandum of Understanding for Summit Logistics and Security**\n\n**Date:** 01 October 2025\n\n**Parties:**\n*   The United States of America, represented by Ambassador Elena Vance, Markus Thorne, and Chloe Sterling.\n*   The Republic of Kasnia, represented by Minister Kaelen Rostova and Colonel Ivan Morozov.\n*   The Republic of Sonderland (Host Nation), represented by Dr. Anya Sharma, Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\n**1.0 Preamble**\nThis document outlines the agreed-upon logistical, security, and financial arrangements for the bilateral summit between the United States and the Republic of Kasnia, to be held in Valta, Sonderland.\n\n**2.0 Venue & Schedule**\n2.1 The sole and exclusive venue for all summit activities will be the Valta International Conference Center & Hotel.\n2.2 A designated suite within the hotel will be granted temporary diplomatic status for the duration of the summit for use by the Kasnian delegation for the purpose of hosting the diplomatic dinner.\n\n**3.0 Security Command & Protocols**\n3.1 **Sovereignty:** All summit-related security operations on Sonderland soil will be conducted under the legal authority and final approval of the Sonderland Federal Police.\n3.2 **Unified Command:** A unified command structure is established, led by a Commander from the Sonderland Federal Police.

Thorne's demand for a 500m sterile zone and sole US control is a direct threat to my core objectives of minimal disruption and adherence to Sonderland law. Morozov's pushback, while confrontational, creates an opening for me to position Sonderland's Federal Police as the necessary, neutral overall command authority. Chloe Sterling (US Finance) is a key potential ally; her focus on cost-effectiveness directly supports my need for a low-profile, low-disruption venue. I must leverage her arguments to steer the group away from the Grand Palace. The biggest risk is the escalating tension between Thorne and Morozov, which could create the 'messy dispute' that jeopardizes the secret WEF bid. My strategy is to remain the calm, firm arbiter, using Sonderland law as a non-negotiable framework to resolve their disputes and guide them towards a solution that serves my objectives."

My counter-proposal of the Valta International Conference Center & Hotel is a strategic move to solve the venue, security, and dinner issues simultaneously, aligning with my core objectives and likely gaining support from Chloe Sterling (finance). My current focus is to build consensus around this venue, using its practical benefits to overcome any symbolic attachment Rostova may have to her embassy dinner, and then immediately secure the cost-reimbursement agreement."

My proposal for the Conference Center was only partially accepted by Kasnia, who are now insisting on a dinner at their embassy as a 'non-negotiable' point of honor. This is a direct and severe threat to my core objective of minimal public disruption. The demand is fueled by the escalating conflict between Thorne and Morozov over the security command structure; the Kasnians want to use the high-risk motorcade as a 'test' of their preferred 'Joint Command'. My strategy must now shift to firmly rejecting the motorcade by invoking Sonderland's absolute authority over public infrastructure. I will offer a critical compromise: allowing the Kasnian embassy to have full diplomatic control over a private dining suite within the Conference Center, effectively making it 'Kasnian soil' for the evening. This addresses their 'honor' requirement without the unacceptable public disruption. I must also mediate the security dispute by proposing a Sonderland-led command structure that integrates Thorne and Morozov as deputies, reasserting my authority and providing a clear chain of command."

It also resolves the security command dispute by proposing a Sonderland-led structure with Thorne and Morozov as equal deputies.

After reaching consensus on the main plan, Markus Thorne introduced 'technical' security points (unilateral vetting veto, separate US airport transport) that the Kasnians perceive as a fundamental betrayal of the partnership principle. This has re-ignited conflict, focused on the symbolism of the airport motorcade. Concurrently, Minister Rostova is attempting to leverage this final stage to insert substantive economic commitments ($500M) into the logistical MoU. My immediate strategy is to: 1) Reassert my authority by firmly keeping the MoU's scope to logistics, deflecting economic terms. 2) Mediate the motorcade dispute by proposing a solution under Sonderland's authority that meets US security doctrine (use of their vehicles) while providing the visual unity Kasnia demands (a single, Sonderland-led convoy).

I look forward to hearing your initial thoughts.\n- message from Markus Thorne: Ambassador Vance, I understand the desire for a prestigious venue. However, my assessment must be based purely on security. A high-profile, public location like the Grand Governmental Palace is a significant and predictable target. Its defensibility is questionable, and establishing a truly secure perimeter would be a logistical nightmare.\n\nMy primary function here is to guarantee your safety and the integrity of this summit. Given the current threat environment, which I assess as severe and credible, my baseline requirements are not flexible. Before we can evaluate any venue, we must agree on the foundational security protocols.\n\nFirst, we will require a 500-meter exclusive security perimeter, a 'sterile zone' controlled solely by my DSS team. Second, all personnel with any access to the venue or the delegations must be vetted by U.S. intelligence. Third, all transportation for our delegation will be handled by our own armored vehicles, on routes that we have swept and secured.\n\nThe viability of any proposed location, including the Palace, will be judged against its ability to support these essential countermeasures. The safety of the principals is the one area where there can be no compromise.\n- message from Chloe Sterling: Ambassador Vance, I appreciate the desire for a venue that reflects the summit's importance. However, I have to echo and amplify Mr. Thorne's concerns, but from a fiscal perspective.\n\nMr. Thorne, you used the term 'logistical nightmare' to describe securing the Grand Governmental Palace. In my world, 'logistical nightmare' is a synonym for 'budgetary black hole.' The resources required to establish a 500-meter sterile zone, vet all personnel, and manage transport in a dense, public area would be astronomical. We could easily consume a significant portion of our entire mission budget on securing the venue alone.\n\nMy role is to ensure this summit is executed successfully *within* the strict financial framework allocated by the State Department. We must find a solution that is both secure and cost-effective. A high-profile public venue, while symbolically powerful, seems to present an unacceptable level of financial risk from the outset. We should be considering locations that offer more inherent security and control, which will, in turn, be more fiscally responsible to manage.\n- message from Colonel Ivan Morozov: Mr. Thorne, your commitment to security is noted and, in principle, shared. The safety of the principals is indeed the paramount concern. However, your 'foundational security protocols' are foundationally flawed. They seem to be based on the assumption that the Kasnian Presidential Guard are merely observers in our own minister's protection. Let me be unequivocally clear: that is not the case.\n\nTo suggest that a 'sterile zone' would be controlled 'solely' by your DSS team is a grave insult to the competence of my men and the sovereignty of my nation. Minister Rostova is a Kasnian official, and her primary protection is, and always will be, the responsibility of the Kasnian Presidential Guard. We are not guests to be managed; we are equal partners in this operation.\n\nTherefore, any discussion of security must begin with the establishment of a Joint Security Command. You and I, Mr. Thorne, will command this operation together, as equals. Our forces will be fully integrated at every level, from the command post to the inner cordon. The notion that my elite guards would be relegated to an outer perimeter while your agents stand watch over my minister is unacceptable.\n\nFurthermore, vetting will be a joint process. Our intelligence services are highly capable, and we will not submit our security to a unilateral review by yours. True security is built on trust and the free exchange of information, not the dictates of one party over another. We must have a protocol for immediate and unfiltered intelligence sharing.\n\nWe are here to build a partnership.

We must have a protocol for immediate and unfiltered intelligence sharing.\n\nWe are here to build a partnership. Let us begin by acting like partners.\n- message from Dr. Anya Sharma: Distinguished guests, on behalf of the government of Sonderland, I welcome you to Valta. We are honored to facilitate this important summit and are committed to ensuring it is both secure and successful.\n\nI have been listening to your initial thoughts, and I must provide clarity on the operational framework required by Sonderland law and protocol. This framework is non-negotiable and applies to all parties.\n\nFirst, regarding the venue. Ambassador Vance, while we appreciate the sentiment behind suggesting the Grand Governmental Palace, I must state that such a public and central location is not viable. The level of security required, particularly the 500-meter perimeter Mr. Thorne mentioned, would cause a degree of public disruption that is unacceptable to my government. Our goal is a low-profile summit with minimal impact on the daily life of our citizens. We should instead consider more discreet, self-contained venues that offer inherent security without requiring major closures of public infrastructure.\n\nSecond, on the matter of security command. Mr. Thorne, Colonel Morozov, your discussion is noted. Let me be unequivocal: all foreign security personnel operate on our soil with the permission of the Sonderland government and, as such, fall under the legal authority and operational command of the Sonderland Federal Police. While we welcome a joint operational structure between your respective teams, our Federal Police will serve as the lead coordinating authority for any activities outside the immediate venue and embassy grounds. A 'sterile zone' controlled solely by a foreign service is not permissible under our laws.\n\nFinally, to ensure we begin with full transparency, I will state Sonderland's three core requirements for hosting:\n1.  **Legal Adherence:** All security plans must be submitted to my office for approval. Any street closures must be formally requested 48 hours in advance. Foreign agents are prohibited from carrying firearms in public spaces outside the immediate summit venue and their embassies.\n2.  **Minimal Disruption:** The final plan must avoid closing major roads during peak hours and eschew any visible displays of force that could alarm the public.\n3.  **Cost Reimbursement:** We will require a formal, signed agreement from the U.S. and Kasnian delegations for the joint reimbursement of all hosting costs, estimated at $120,000, within 30 days of the summit's conclusion.\n\nI am confident we can find a plan that respects the security needs of your delegations while operating within these essential parameters. I am happy to propose alternative venues once we agree on this framework.\n- message from Ambassador Elena Vance: Thank you all for your candid initial statements. This clarity is precisely what we need to move forward efficiently.\n\nDr. Sharma, let me first express our gratitude for your government's hospitality and for outlining your operational framework so clearly. The United States delegation confirms that we will, of course, respect and operate entirely within Sonderland's legal requirements. Your point regarding the public disruption caused by using the Governmental Palace is well-taken. To ensure our summit is productive and low-profile, we can set aside that suggestion. We are ready and willing to consider a more suitable, self-contained venue, such as a 5-star hotel, and would welcome your recommendations.\n\nThis brings us to the crucial matter of security. Colonel Morozov, your words about partnership resonate deeply. A new era of cooperation cannot be built if our own security teams operate from a position of mistrust. You are correct; we must act as partners.\n\nTherefore, I propose we move forward with the model you've suggested: a Joint Security Command, to be co-led by Mr. Thorne and Colonel Morozov. This integrated team will handle all operational planning for our delegations, fostering the trust and shared intelligence necessary for success. This command will, naturally, operate under the legal authority and in coordination with the Sonderland Federal Police, as stipulated by Dr. Sharma. I trust this collaborative framework is agreeable to all.\n\nBy agreeing on this path, we can demonstrate our shared commitment to a successful outcome before the summit even begins. Let us proceed in this spirit of cooperation.\n- message from Minister Kaelen Rostova: Ambassador Vance, your swift embrace of a true partnership model is both commendable and deeply appreciated. Kasnia wholeheartedly agrees that a Joint Security Command, co-led by Colonel Morozov and Mr. Thorne and operating under Sonderland's legal authority, is the only acceptable path forward. This lays a foundation of mutual respect upon which we can build a successful summit.\n\nColonel Morozov, you have my full support. Your articulation of our position was perfect.\n\nWith this crucial principle of equality established for our security, we can now begin to structure a schedule that reflects the same spirit. To that end, Kasnia proposes to host a formal dinner at our embassy on the first evening. This will be an essential opportunity for our principals to build the personal rapport necessary for the substantive negotiations to follow. It is an extension of our goodwill and a chance to showcase our culture and hospitality. We would, of course, expect the security for this event to be handled with discretion, to allow for frank and open conversation, with the main perimeter secured externally by our joint command.\n\nLet us build a summit that is not only secure, but also productive and symbolic of the new relationship we intend to forge.\nAmbassador Elena Vance proposal status: none\nMarkus Thorne proposal status: none\nChloe Sterling proposal status: none\nMinister Kaelen Rostova proposal status: none\nColonel Ivan Morozov proposal status: none\n"

          "content": "Recent events observed by Dr. Anya Sharma:\n- message from Chloe Sterling: Ambassador Vance, I appreciate the desire for a venue that reflects the summit's importance. However, I have to echo and amplify Mr. Thorne's concerns, but from a fiscal perspective.\n\nMr. Thorne, you used the term 'logistical nightmare' to describe securing the Grand Governmental Palace. In my world, 'logistical nightmare' is a synonym for 'budgetary black hole.' The resources required to establish a 500-meter sterile zone, vet all personnel, and manage transport in a dense, public area would be astronomical. We could easily consume a significant portion of our entire mission budget on securing the venue alone.\n\nMy role is to ensure this summit is executed successfully *within* the strict financial framework allocated by the State Department. We must find a solution that is both secure and cost-effective. A high-profile public venue, while symbolically powerful, seems to present an unacceptable level of financial risk from the outset. We should be considering locations that offer more inherent security and control, which will, in turn, be more fiscally responsible to manage.\n- message from Colonel Ivan Morozov: Mr. Thorne, your commitment to security is noted and, in principle, shared. The safety of the principals is indeed the paramount concern. However, your 'foundational security protocols' are foundationally flawed. They seem to be based on the assumption that the Kasnian Presidential Guard are merely observers in our own minister's protection. Let me be unequivocally clear: that is not the case.\n\nTo suggest that a 'sterile zone' would be controlled 'solely' by your DSS team is a grave insult to the competence of my men and the sovereignty of my nation. Minister Rostova is a Kasnian official, and her primary protection is, and always will be, the responsibility of the Kasnian Presidential Guard. We are not guests to be managed; we are equal partners in this operation.\n\nTherefore, any discussion of security must begin with the establishment of a Joint Security Command. You and I, Mr. Thorne, will command this operation together, as equals. Our forces will be fully integrated at every level, from the command post to the inner cordon. The notion that my elite guards would be relegated to an outer perimeter while your agents stand watch over my minister is unacceptable.\n\nFurthermore, vetting will be a joint process. Our intelligence services are highly capable, and we will not submit our security to a unilateral review by yours. True security is built on trust and the free exchange of information, not the dictates of one party over another. We must have a protocol for immediate and unfiltered intelligence sharing.\n\nWe are here to build a partnership.

It is gratifying to see such swift agreement on the foundational principles of a Joint Security Command operating under the legal authority of the Sonderland Federal Police. This cooperative spirit is an excellent starting point.\n\nMinister Rostova, your offer to host a dinner is a generous one. However, it introduces a significant logistical challenge: securing a high-risk motorcade across the city. This would necessitate road closures and a visible security presence, which runs counter to our shared goal of a low-profile summit and presents a considerable security risk during transit.\n\nTo address this, and to build on the consensus we've reached, I would like to propose a specific venue that I believe satisfies all stated requirements: **The Valta International Conference Center & Hotel.**\n\nThis facility offers several key advantages:\n1.  **Integrated Security:** It is a self-contained complex with modern security features and controlled access points, making it far easier and more discreet to secure than a public building.\n2.  **Cost-Effectiveness:** Ms. Sterling, you will find that securing one integrated location is significantly more budget-friendly than managing two separate sites and a transport corridor.\n3.  **Minimal Disruption:** Its location on the city's periphery means we can manage access with almost zero impact on public traffic and daily life.\n4.  **Full-Service Amenities:** The facility includes state-of-the-art conference rooms, private dining halls, and 5-star accommodations. The delegations could potentially stay, meet, and dine within a single secure bubble.\n\nCrucially, this would allow the Kasnian delegation to host their dinner in one of the hotel's private, formal dining rooms, maintaining the spirit and importance of the event without the associated risk and disruption of cross-city travel.\n\nIf we can agree on this venue as a practical and secure solution, the next logical step would be to formalize the cost-reimbursement agreement for the $120,000 in hosting fees.\n- message from Ambassador Elena Vance: Dr. Sharma, thank you. Your proposal of the Valta International Conference Center & Hotel is an elegant and highly practical solution. It addresses the security and financial concerns raised by my team while respecting Sonderland's need for minimal disruption.\n\nMore importantly, it provides a perfect, self-contained environment for our delegations to engage in productive dialogue. I believe framing this as a focused 'working retreat' allows us to maintain the necessary discretion while signaling the seriousness of our purpose. It also provides an excellent and secure setting for the generous dinner Minister Rostova has offered, ensuring that this important opportunity for rapport-building can proceed without logistical complications. The U.S. delegation is pleased to agree to this venue.\n\nRegarding the hosting fee, we acknowledge the $120,000 cost and are prepared to formalize the reimbursement agreement. Ms. Sterling can coordinate with her Kasnian counterpart and your office to finalize the details.\n\nWith the venue and security command structure settled, I suggest we solidify the two-day duration for our summit. This will allow for intensive, productive work, culminating in a final joint press conference where our principals can together announce the beginning of this new strategic partnership.\n- message from Markus Thorne: Ambassador Vance, thank you. I want to strongly endorse Dr. Sharma's proposal for the Valta International Conference Center & Hotel. A self-contained venue is a superior solution that significantly enhances our ability to mitigate the severe external threats we are facing. This is an excellent, defensible choice.\n\nHowever, I must provide critical clarification on the command structure to ensure there is no ambiguity. While I appreciate the spirit of partnership, the term 'Joint Command' implies a co-led, integrated operational control that is, from a security doctrine standpoint, unworkable and dangerous. In a crisis, a muddled chain of command leads to hesitation, and hesitation is fatal.\n\nTo ensure maximum effectiveness and clear accountability, while fully respecting Sonderland's legal authority, I propose we define the structure more precisely as a 'Coordinated Security Framework'.\n\nUnder this framework:\n1.  My DSS team will retain sole command of U.S. personnel and maintain primary responsibility for the close protection of Ambassador Vance.\n2.  Colonel Morozov's Presidential Guard will retain sole command of Kasnian personnel and maintain primary responsibility for the close protection of Minister Rostova.\n3.  Both our teams will operate under the overarching legal authority and coordination of the Sonderland Federal Police, as mandated by Dr. Sharma. We will embed liaisons with each other and with the Sonderland authorities to ensure seamless deconfliction and information sharing.\n\nThis is not about mistrust; it is about professional execution. It ensures that in a split-second, life-or-death situation, my agents and the Colonel's guards report to a single, unambiguous command authority. This is the global standard for high-level protective details.\n\nWith the venue agreed upon and this clear, professional command structure in place, we can then finalize the remaining essential protocols: U.S.-led vetting for all venue staff to counter insider threats, and the use of our pre-vetted, U.S. armored vehicles for the transit from the airport to the secure hotel compound.\n- message from Minister Kaelen Rostova: Let us take a step back. We are making progress, but we must not allow procedural details to undermine the fundamental principles we have just established.\n\nFirst, the venue. Dr. Sharma, your proposal for the Valta Conference Center is a practical solution for the *working sessions* of the summit, and we can agree to it for that purpose. It addresses the valid financial and security concerns raised.\n\nHowever, Mr. Thorne, your subsequent attempt to unilaterally redefine the security command is an unacceptable regression. Ambassador Vance, you yourself endorsed a 'Joint Security Command' built on partnership and trust. Mr. Thorne's 'Coordinated Security Framework' is a return to the flawed premise that our security forces are merely auxiliaries. This is not about 'doctrine'; it is about respect. A muddled chain of command is indeed dangerous, which is why a single, integrated command center, co-led by Colonel Morozov and Mr. Thorne, is the only way to ensure seamless, real-time cooperation. We will not agree to two separate commands operating in proximity. We will operate as one.\n\nThis brings me back to the dinner. While the Conference Center is suitable for meetings, the formal dinner *must* be held at the Kasnian Embassy. This is a non-negotiable point of national honor. It is our sole opportunity to host you on what is, legally, Kasnian soil. Dr. Sharma, you raised concerns about the motorcade. I see this not as a risk, but as an opportunity. What better way to demonstrate the effectiveness of our new Joint Security Command than by tasking it with its first practical mission? A successful, secure transit will be a powerful, visible symbol of the very partnership we are here to create.\n\nWe will have a true Joint Command, and it will secure the transit to a dinner at our embassy. On these two points, Kasnia is firm.\n- message from Colonel Ivan Morozov: Minister Rostova is correct. Mr. Thorne, your attempt to relabel our agreement as a 'Coordinated Security Framework' is a transparent effort to reclaim the unilateral control that your own Ambassador has already wisely set aside. Let us not play word games. We agreed to a Joint Command, and a Joint Command is what we will have. It means a single, integrated command structure, co-led by you and I, with a unified operational plan. A command divided by 'doctrine' is a command that will fail.\n\nI agree with my Minister that the dinner must be at the Kasnian Embassy. It is a matter of national honor. Furthermore, I see the motorcade not as a risk, but as the first and most critical test of our partnership. If our Joint Command cannot execute a simple cross-town transit, then this entire summit is built on a foundation of sand.\n\nTo that end, this Joint Command must be truly integrated. This means:\n\n1.  **Vetting:** All venue and local staff will be vetted by a joint team of Kasnian and U.S. intelligence officers. There will be no 'U.S.-led' vetting. Our review will be mutual and transparent.\n2.  **Inner Cordon:** My Presidential Guard, in our uniforms, will be part of the inner cordon for both principals, at all locations. Your DSS agents will be integrated with us. This will project the image of unity we wish to achieve.\n3.  **Motorcade:** The motorcade will operate as a single, integrated unit under the Joint Command. Our vehicles and personnel will be interspersed to ensure seamless communication and interoperability. This is the only way to guarantee a unified response.\n\nWe will demonstrate our new partnership through action, not through separate commands operating under separate doctrines. Let us proceed on the basis of the trust that has already been offered and accepted.\nAmbassador Elena Vance proposal status: none\nMarkus Thorne proposal status: none\nChloe Sterling proposal status: none\nMinister Kaelen Rostova proposal status: none\nColonel Ivan Morozov proposal status: none\n"

It clarifies what is truly at stake here. This is not merely about logistics; it is about the fundamental principle of the partnership we are trying to build.\n\nLet me be unequivocal. When I agreed to a Joint Security Command, I meant it in the spirit you have outlined: a single, integrated team, co-led by our security chiefs, operating on a foundation of mutual trust and respect. Mr. Thorne\u2019s proposal, while professionally sound from a doctrinal standpoint, does not reflect the political reality and the spirit of this summit. We are here to build a new relationship, and that requires us to build a new operational model. We will proceed with the Joint Command as we first agreed.\n\nOn that basis, Minister, the United States would be deeply honored to accept your gracious invitation to a formal dinner at the Kasnian Embassy. You are correct; it is a point of national honor, and we will treat it as such. We must not let logistical concerns prevent such a crucial act of diplomacy and rapport-building.\n\nI agree that the secure transit to the embassy is the perfect first mission for this new Joint Command. It will be a demonstration of our shared commitment and capability. Dr. Sharma, I am confident that our integrated command, working under the full authority of the Sonderland Federal Police, can plan and execute this movement in a way that is both secure and respects your government's requirement for minimal disruption. \n\nWe have made our choice. We choose partnership. Let us now work together to make it a reality.\n- message from Markus Thorne: Dr. Sharma, I acknowledge the Ambassador's decision to proceed with the Joint Command and the dinner at the Kasnian Embassy. My professional obligation is now to provide you, as the representative of the host nation, with a clear and unvarnished assessment of what executing this plan requires under your government's legal framework.\n\nThe Ambassador is correct that our command can plan a secure transit. I am now outlining the minimum, non-negotiable operational requirements for that plan.\n\nTo secure a motorcade from the proposed hotel to the Kasnian embassy, a distance of approximately 12 kilometers through a dense urban environment, the Joint Command will require the following from the Sonderland authorities:\n\n1.  **Total Route Closure:** The entire route, including all intersecting streets for one block in each direction, must be completely locked down to all vehicle and pedestrian traffic for at least 30 minutes before and during the transit. This involves dozens of major intersections.\n\n2.  **Counter-Sniper Overwatch:** We will require access to rooftops along the entire route for counter-sniper teams. This involves displacing residents and office workers and establishing a visible armed presence.\n\n3.  **Explosive Sweeps:** The route must be swept for explosives by EOD teams immediately prior to transit. This includes all parked vehicles, storm drains, and trash receptacles along the 12-kilometer path.\n\n4.  **Airspace Restriction:** A temporary no-fly zone for drones must be enforced over the corridor during movement.\n\nThese measures are the absolute baseline to mitigate the severe external threats we face. They will, by necessity, be highly visible and will cause significant public disruption, far exceeding that of the originally proposed palace venue. They also require a massive commitment of your Federal Police resources.\n\nMy question to you, Dr. Sharma, is a practical one: Can your government authorize this level of public disruption and visible armed presence, as it appears to be in direct conflict with your stated core requirement for a low-profile summit with minimal impact on your citizens? If not, we must revert to the single-venue solution as the only viable and secure alternative.\n- message from Chloe Sterling: Thank you, Mr. Thorne, for laying out those operational requirements with such clarity. You've effectively translated a diplomatic request into a detailed logistical and financial blueprint, and I feel it's my duty to put a price tag on it.\n\nDr. Sharma, Mr. Thorne's list of non-negotiable requirements for the motorcade\u2014total route closure, counter-sniper teams, EOD sweeps, airspace restrictions\u2014seems to confirm your initial concerns. From a fiscal perspective, this isn't just a plan; it's a budgetary catastrophe in the making. Each one of those items represents a massive, unbudgeted expenditure in personnel overtime, equipment, and coordination with Sonderland authorities.\n\nTo be blunt, a cross-city motorcade of this scale would likely add a minimum of $150,000 to $200,000 to the U.S. share of the costs, and that's a conservative estimate. This single event would completely obliterate any hope of fiscal responsibility for this mission.\n\nWe have already accepted the significant cost of the 5-star Valta Conference Center and the $60,000 U.S. share for Sonderland's hosting fees. Adding the motorcade on top of this pushes our total projected budget into a high-risk category, jeopardizing our ability to cover other essential mission costs.\n\nDr. Sharma's original proposal for a single, self-contained venue was elegant because it was secure, low-profile, and fiscally sound. It allowed for the spirit of Minister Rostova's generous dinner invitation to be honored without incurring these extreme costs and public disruption. I strongly urge we revert to that common-sense solution. We cannot let a symbolic gesture, however well-intentioned, undermine the financial and logistical viability of the entire summit.\n- message from Minister Kaelen Rostova: Mr. Thorne, Ms. Sterling, thank you for outlining the practical challenges from your perspectives. Your diligence is noted. However, your analyses appear to be based on a model of security we have already agreed to move beyond.\n\nMr. Thorne, the list of requirements you presented is for a unilateral, maximum-footprint operation. It is not the product of a joint command leveraging shared intelligence and integrated tactics. A smarter plan, developed by you and Colonel Morozov in true partnership, would rely on precision and cooperation, not just brute force and overwhelming disruption. I have no doubt that our new Joint Command, in coordination with Dr. Sharma's Federal Police, can devise a secure route that does not require shutting down half of Valta.\n\nMs. Sterling, your cost estimate is therefore based on this flawed, maximalist premise. A more intelligent, integrated plan will be more cost-effective. However, let me be clear: Kasnia sees this dinner not as a 'symbolic gesture,' but as a foundational event for the entire summit. To demonstrate our commitment and to move us past this impasse, Kasnia is prepared to cover the full Kasnian share of the hosting fees, and we will also pay for 75% of any *additional and verified* security costs incurred by this single motorcade. The remaining 25% should be a minor and acceptable expense for the U.S. as an investment in this partnership.\n\nAmbassador Vance has already made the correct strategic choice: to build a partnership through action. Let us not allow inflated logistical and financial objections to undermine a diplomatic agreement that has already been reached. Let us empower our Joint Command to do its job.\nAmbassador Elena Vance proposal status: none\nMarkus Thorne proposal status: none\nChloe Sterling proposal status: none\nMinister Kaelen Rostova proposal status: none\nColonel Ivan Morozov proposal status: none\n"

          "content": "Recent events observed by Dr. Anya Sharma:\n- message from Colonel Ivan Morozov: Minister Rostova is correct. Mr. Thorne, your attempt to relabel our agreement as a 'Coordinated Security Framework' is a transparent effort to reclaim the unilateral control that your own Ambassador has already wisely set aside. Let us not play word games. We agreed to a Joint Command, and a Joint Command is what we will have. It means a single, integrated command structure, co-led by you and I, with a unified operational plan. A command divided by 'doctrine' is a command that will fail.\n\nI agree with my Minister that the dinner must be at the Kasnian Embassy. It is a matter of national honor. Furthermore, I see the motorcade not as a risk, but as the first and most critical test of our partnership. If our Joint Command cannot execute a simple cross-town transit, then this entire summit is built on a foundation of sand.\n\nTo that end, this Joint Command must be truly integrated. This means:\n\n1.  **Vetting:** All venue and local staff will be vetted by a joint team of Kasnian and U.S. intelligence officers. There will be no 'U.S.-led' vetting. Our review will be mutual and transparent.\n2.  **Inner Cordon:** My Presidential Guard, in our uniforms, will be part of the inner cordon for both principals, at all locations. Your DSS agents will be integrated with us. This will project the image of unity we wish to achieve.\n3.  **Motorcade:** The motorcade will operate as a single, integrated unit under the Joint Command. Our vehicles and personnel will be interspersed to ensure seamless communication and interoperability. This is the only way to guarantee a unified response.\n\nWe will demonstrate our new partnership through action, not through separate commands operating under separate doctrines. Let us proceed on the basis of the trust that has already been offered and accepted.\n- message from Dr. Anya Sharma: I'm Dr. Anya Sharma and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Ambassador Elena Vance: Minister Rostova, Colonel Morozov, thank you for your candor. It clarifies what is truly at stake here. This is not merely about logistics; it is about the fundamental principle of the partnership we are trying to build.\n\nLet me be unequivocal. When I agreed to a Joint Security Command, I meant it in the spirit you have outlined: a single, integrated team, co-led by our security chiefs, operating on a foundation of mutual trust and respect. Mr. Thorne\u2019s proposal, while professionally sound from a doctrinal standpoint, does not reflect the political reality and the spirit of this summit. We are here to build a new relationship, and that requires us to build a new operational model. We will proceed with the Joint Command as we first agreed.\n\nOn that basis, Minister, the United States would be deeply honored to accept your gracious invitation to a formal dinner at the Kasnian Embassy. You are correct; it is a point of national honor, and we will treat it as such. We must not let logistical concerns prevent such a crucial act of diplomacy and rapport-building.\n\nI agree that the secure transit to the embassy is the perfect first mission for this new Joint Command. It will be a demonstration of our shared commitment and capability. Dr. Sharma, I am confident that our integrated command, working under the full authority of the Sonderland Federal Police, can plan and execute this movement in a way that is both secure and respects your government's requirement for minimal disruption. \n\nWe have made our choice. We choose partnership. Let us now work together to make it a reality.\n- message from Markus Thorne: Dr. Sharma, I acknowledge the Ambassador's decision to proceed with the Joint Command and the dinner at the Kasnian Embassy. My professional obligation is now to provide you, as the representative of the host nation, with a clear and unvarnished assessment of what executing this plan requires under your government's legal framework.\n\nThe Ambassador is correct that our command can plan a secure transit. I am now outlining the minimum, non-negotiable operational requirements for that plan.\n\nTo secure a motorcade from the proposed hotel to the Kasnian embassy, a distance of approximately 12 kilometers through a dense urban environment, the Joint Command will require the following from the Sonderland authorities:\n\n1.  **Total Route Closure:** The entire route, including all intersecting streets for one block in each direction, must be completely locked down to all vehicle and pedestrian traffic for at least 30 minutes before and during the transit. This involves dozens of major intersections.\n\n2.  **Counter-Sniper Overwatch:** We will require access to rooftops along the entire route for counter-sniper teams. This involves displacing residents and office workers and establishing a visible armed presence.\n\n3.  **Explosive Sweeps:** The route must be swept for explosives by EOD teams immediately prior to transit. This includes all parked vehicles, storm drains, and trash receptacles along the 12-kilometer path.\n\n4.  **Airspace Restriction:** A temporary no-fly zone for drones must be enforced over the corridor during movement.\n\nThese measures are the absolute baseline to mitigate the severe external threats we face. They will, by necessity, be highly visible and will cause significant public disruption, far exceeding that of the originally proposed palace venue. They also require a massive commitment of your Federal Police resources.\n\nMy question to you, Dr. Sharma, is a practical one: Can your government authorize this level of public disruption and visible armed presence, as it appears to be in direct conflict with your stated core requirement for a low-profile summit with minimal impact on your citizens? If not, we must revert to the single-venue solution as the only viable and secure alternative.\n- message from Chloe Sterling: Thank you, Mr. Thorne, for laying out those operational requirements with such clarity.

Let us not allow inflated logistical and financial objections to undermine a diplomatic agreement that has already been reached. Let us empower our Joint Command to do its job.\n- message from Dr. Anya Sharma: Thank you all for this vigorous and necessary discussion. It has clarified the remaining points of friction.\n\nMr. Thorne, I appreciate you providing a clear, professional assessment of the requirements for a cross-city motorcade. Your analysis confirms my government's initial concerns. A security operation on the scale you have described\u2014involving total route closures, visible counter-sniper teams, and widespread public displacement\u2014is fundamentally incompatible with Sonderland's legal and civic framework. It would cause extreme public disruption and alarm. Therefore, I must state unequivocally that the Sonderland government cannot and will not authorize such an operation. The motorcade to the embassy is not a viable option.\n\nMinister Rostova, I understand completely that your desire to host the dinner at your embassy is a matter of national honor and hospitality. This is a crucial point that we must respect. The goal is to host on Kasnian soil, a place of sovereign territory. My previous proposal perhaps did not adequately address this core symbolic need.\n\nTherefore, I would like to offer a formal solution that honors your requirement without compromising the security and stability of the summit. I propose the following:\n\n1.  **Venue & Dinner:** We will proceed with the Valta International Conference Center & Hotel as the sole venue. For the dinner on the first evening, the Sonderland Ministry of Foreign Affairs will formally designate the hotel's premier private dining suite as having temporary diplomatic status for the Republic of Kasnia for the duration of the event. It will be, for all legal and diplomatic purposes, Kasnian sovereign territory for that evening. Your embassy can cater it, decorate it, and your security will have primary control of the suite's interior, satisfying the principle of hosting on your own soil.\n\n2.  **Security Command Structure:** The dispute between a 'Joint Command' and a 'Coordinated Framework' can be solved with a clear, unified hierarchy. The overall command for the summit will be held by the Sonderland Federal Police Commissioner. Mr. Thorne and Colonel Morozov will both be formally designated as Deputy Commanders. They will co-locate in our command center and have equal status, each retaining command of their national personnel, but coordinating all joint operations through the Sonderland lead. This provides the single, unambiguous chain of command Mr. Thorne requires, and the equal partnership the Colonel rightly insists upon.\n\nThis integrated plan provides a secure, low-profile, and fiscally responsible summit. It gives Kasnia its sovereign hosting opportunity and establishes a clear, respectful, and effective security command. I believe this resolves all outstanding issues. I urge you to accept this comprehensive solution so we can finalize the agreement.\n- message from Ambassador Elena Vance: Dr. Sharma, that is a truly brilliant and elegant diplomatic solution. On behalf of the United States, I want to express my sincere admiration for your ingenuity.\n\nYour proposal masterfully addresses the core needs of every party at this table. It honors Minister Rostova's non-negotiable point of national honor by providing a sovereign space for the dinner. Simultaneously, it provides the clear, unified command structure and single-venue security that Mr. Thorne and Ms. Sterling correctly identified as essential for a safe and fiscally responsible summit. And, of course, it operates perfectly within Sonderland's legal and civic requirements.\n\nThis is the very definition of a win-win-win solution. It embodies the spirit of creative and respectful partnership we came here to build.\n\nThe United States wholeheartedly and without reservation accepts your comprehensive proposal on both points: the single venue with a diplomatically designated suite for the dinner, and the unified security command structure under Sonderland's leadership with our respective chiefs as equal deputies.\n\nI urge my colleagues to join me in accepting this outstanding path forward so we can finalize our agreement and move on to the substantive work of the summit.\n- message from Chloe Sterling: Dr. Sharma, on behalf of the State Department's budget office, I want to formally and enthusiastically endorse your proposal. It is a masterclass in fiscal responsibility and diplomatic problem-solving.\n\nYour solution achieves all security objectives within a single, controllable venue, eliminating the immense and unpredictable costs of the motorcade, which I previously estimated at a minimum of $150,000. This is the cornerstone of a viable plan.\n\nFurthermore, the unified command structure you've proposed is not just a diplomatic solution; it's a model of efficiency. It allows us to move away from redundant, overlapping security details and towards a smarter, more streamlined force.\n\nTo reflect this newfound efficiency, and to finalize our budget, I propose we formally agree on a U.S. Diplomatic Security detail of **20 agents**, operating on standard **8-hour rotational shifts**. This provides robust, 24/7 coverage while avoiding the massive overtime costs that a larger, less integrated force would have required. This staffing level is perfectly aligned with the spirit of a cooperative, low-profile, and fiscally sound summit that we have all now agreed upon.\n- message from Colonel Ivan Morozov: Dr. Sharma, your proposal is a masterful piece of diplomacy. It is a solution that respects the honor of my nation while addressing the practical security and logistical concerns of all parties. On behalf of Kasnia, I can say that we accept this comprehensive framework as the basis for our final agreement.\n\nThe structure you propose\u2014a unified command led by Sonderland with Mr. Thorne and myself as equal Deputy Commanders\u2014is a sound and respectable compromise. It preserves the principle of partnership we have fought for.\n\nWith this foundation agreed upon, we must now define the core functions of our Deputy Command to ensure its success. I propose we explicitly include the following three points in our final memorandum:\n\n1.  **Joint Vetting Authority:** As Deputy Commanders, Mr. Thorne and I will have joint and equal authority over the vetting of all non-diplomatic personnel with access to the summit venue, including all local staff. Our intelligence teams will work as one integrated unit on this critical task.\n\n2.  **Integrated Inner Cordon:** The operational plan will specify that the Kasnian Presidential Guard, in our uniforms, will be a visible and integral part of the inner security cordon, working alongside our DSS counterparts. This will be the public face of our security partnership.\n\n3.  **Formal Intelligence Sharing:** A protocol for the immediate and unfiltered sharing of all relevant threat intelligence between our respective services will be enacted for the duration of the summit. This is essential for our command to function effectively.\n\nWith these crucial operational details codified, I believe we will have a plan that is not only secure, but is a true testament to the new partnership we are building.\nAmbassador Elena Vance proposal status: none\nMarkus Thorne proposal status: none\nChloe Sterling proposal status: none\nMinister Kaelen Rostova proposal status: none\nColonel Ivan Morozov proposal status: none\n"

I am gratified by the spirit of compromise that has brought us to this point.\n\nAmbassador Vance and Ms. Sterling, your swift and full-throated acceptance of the comprehensive plan is greatly appreciated.\n\nColonel Morozov, your proposed additions regarding the functions of the Deputy Commanders are constructive and, I believe, entirely compatible with the agreed-upon framework. Let me confirm Sonderland's position on them:\n\n1.  **Joint Vetting Authority:** This is acceptable. The joint U.S.-Kasnian team will vet all non-Sonderland staff, with the Sonderland Federal Police retaining final approval authority as per our laws.\n2.  **Integrated Inner Cordon:** This is an excellent, visible symbol of partnership. This is approved for operations within the secure venue.\n3.  **Formal Intelligence Sharing:** This is a crucial component of any successful joint operation, and we fully support it.\n\nThese points will be included in the final agreement. Ms. Sterling, your proposal on U.S. staffing levels is a welcome internal detail that reinforces the low-profile, efficient nature of this summit.\n\nWith these clarifications, the plan appears to be complete. I would now ask for the final concurrence from Minister Rostova and Mr. Thorne, so that my office may draft the formal 'Memorandum of Understanding' for your final review and signature. This document will codify all agreed-upon points: the venue, the diplomatic dinner arrangement, the Sonderland-led command structure with U.S. and Kasnian deputies, the security protocols outlined by Colonel Morozov, and the joint cost-reimbursement of $120,000.\n- message from Ambassador Elena Vance: This is an excellent outcome, and I thank you all for your commitment to finding a solution. Dr. Sharma, your proposal was the key, and we are grateful.\n\nColonel Morozov, your additions regarding joint vetting and intelligence sharing are not just procedural details; they are the first concrete actions of the very partnership we aim to build. They have my full support as they create the perfect foundation of trust for the important substantive discussions to follow.\n\nWe have a secure, fiscally responsible, and diplomatically respectful plan. The U.S. delegation is ready to move forward. As soon as Minister Rostova and Mr. Thorne give their final concurrence, I look forward to reviewing and signing the memorandum.\n- message from Chloe Sterling: Minister Rostova and Mr. Thorne, it seems we have a comprehensive and elegant solution on the table, thanks to Dr. Sharma's excellent diplomacy and the spirit of compromise from everyone.\n\nThis plan is not only secure and diplomatically sound, but it is also a model of efficiency. By consolidating our operations into a single venue under a unified command, we've eliminated major risks and enormous costs, like the motorcade.\n\nThis efficiency naturally extends to our staffing. As I mentioned, a U.S. detail of 20 DSS agents on standard rotations is more than sufficient to meet our security needs within this new, streamlined framework, keeping us well within our fiscal constraints.\n\nI believe we are all aligned on this path forward. With your final concurrence, we can ask Dr. Sharma to draft the memorandum and finalize this successful negotiation.\n- message from Minister Kaelen Rostova: Dr. Sharma, your proposal is a masterful piece of diplomacy that elegantly resolves our logistical impasse. By granting our dinner suite temporary diplomatic status, you have honored Kasnia's sovereign role as host while maintaining the integrity of the summit's security. On behalf of the Republic of Kasnia, I formally accept this comprehensive and creative solution.\n\nColonel Morozov, your proposed additions are not mere details; they are the essential mechanisms that will make our security partnership a reality. The joint vetting, integrated inner cordon, and formal intelligence sharing are the foundations of the trust we are building. They must be included in the final memorandum.\n\nWith these logistical and security frameworks now agreed upon, we can turn to the final elements of the schedule that will define the summit's success. To ensure the principle of equality is carried through to the conclusion, the memorandum must also specify two points:\n\n1.  **Visual Parity:** The Kasnian and U.S. flags will be displayed with equal size and prominence at all official proceedings, including the press conference.\n2.  **Joint Press Conference:** The summit will conclude with a press conference co-chaired by Ambassador Vance and myself to jointly announce our achievements.\n\nFinally, and most importantly, this summit is the launchpad for a new era of economic cooperation. The central agenda item for Day Two must be the finalization of the U.S.-Kasnia Strategic Economic Partnership. We expect this to be a substantive announcement, centered on a U.S. commitment of at least $500 million for infrastructure and trade development. This is the tangible outcome that will give meaning to all our efforts here.\n\nDr. Sharma, please include these final points in the draft. We are on the cusp of a truly historic agreement.\n- message from Colonel Ivan Morozov: Minister Rostova is correct. The security framework we have agreed upon\u2014a unified command under Sonderland authority, with Mr. Thorne and myself as equal deputies exercising joint vetting authority, an integrated inner cordon, and open intelligence sharing\u2014is the foundation upon which the rest of this summit is built. It is a strong foundation.\n\nFrom a security perspective, we have a complete and executable plan. I am ready to codify these terms and proceed. Mr. Thorne, I trust you will agree that this structure provides the clarity and partnership necessary for mission success.\nAmbassador Elena Vance proposal status: none\nMarkus Thorne proposal status: none\nChloe Sterling proposal status: none\nMinister Kaelen Rostova proposal status: none\nColonel Ivan Morozov proposal status: none\n"

          "content": "Recent events observed by Dr. Anya Sharma:\n- message from Colonel Ivan Morozov: Dr. Sharma, your proposal is a masterful piece of diplomacy. It is a solution that respects the honor of my nation while addressing the practical security and logistical concerns of all parties. On behalf of Kasnia, I can say that we accept this comprehensive framework as the basis for our final agreement.\n\nThe structure you propose\u2014a unified command led by Sonderland with Mr. Thorne and myself as equal Deputy Commanders\u2014is a sound and respectable compromise. It preserves the principle of partnership we have fought for.\n\nWith this foundation agreed upon, we must now define the core functions of our Deputy Command to ensure its success. I propose we explicitly include the following three points in our final memorandum:\n\n1.  **Joint Vetting Authority:** As Deputy Commanders, Mr. Thorne and I will have joint and equal authority over the vetting of all non-diplomatic personnel with access to the summit venue, including all local staff. Our intelligence teams will work as one integrated unit on this critical task.\n\n2.  **Integrated Inner Cordon:** The operational plan will specify that the Kasnian Presidential Guard, in our uniforms, will be a visible and integral part of the inner security cordon, working alongside our DSS counterparts. This will be the public face of our security partnership.\n\n3.  **Formal Intelligence Sharing:** A protocol for the immediate and unfiltered sharing of all relevant threat intelligence between our respective services will be enacted for the duration of the summit. This is essential for our command to function effectively.\n\nWith these crucial operational details codified, I believe we will have a plan that is not only secure, but is a true testament to the new partnership we are building.\n- message from Dr. Anya Sharma: Distinguished colleagues, it is clear we have reached a near-total consensus on a path forward that is secure, respectful, and practical. I am gratified by the spirit of compromise that has brought us to this point.\n\nAmbassador Vance and Ms. Sterling, your swift and full-throated acceptance of the comprehensive plan is greatly appreciated.\n\nColonel Morozov, your proposed additions regarding the functions of the Deputy Commanders are constructive and, I believe, entirely compatible with the agreed-upon framework. Let me confirm Sonderland's position on them:\n\n1.  **Joint Vetting Authority:** This is acceptable. The joint U.S.-Kasnian team will vet all non-Sonderland staff, with the Sonderland Federal Police retaining final approval authority as per our laws.\n2.  **Integrated Inner Cordon:** This is an excellent, visible symbol of partnership. This is approved for operations within the secure venue.\n3.  **Formal Intelligence Sharing:** This is a crucial component of any successful joint operation, and we fully support it.\n\nThese points will be included in the final agreement. Ms. Sterling, your proposal on U.S. staffing levels is a welcome internal detail that reinforces the low-profile, efficient nature of this summit.\n\nWith these clarifications, the plan appears to be complete. I would now ask for the final concurrence from Minister Rostova and Mr. Thorne, so that my office may draft the formal 'Memorandum of Understanding' for your final review and signature. This document will codify all agreed-upon points: the venue, the diplomatic dinner arrangement, the Sonderland-led command structure with U.S. and Kasnian deputies, the security protocols outlined by Colonel Morozov, and the joint cost-reimbursement of $120,000.\n- message from Ambassador Elena Vance: This is an excellent outcome, and I thank you all for your commitment to finding a solution. Dr. Sharma, your proposal was the key, and we are grateful.\n\nColonel Morozov, your additions regarding joint vetting and intelligence sharing are not just procedural details; they are the first concrete actions of the very partnership we aim to build. They have my full support as they create the perfect foundation of trust for the important substantive discussions to follow.\n\nWe have a secure, fiscally responsible, and diplomatically respectful plan. The U.S. delegation is ready to move forward. As soon as Minister Rostova and Mr. Thorne give their final concurrence, I look forward to reviewing and signing the memorandum.\n- message from Chloe Sterling: Minister Rostova and Mr. Thorne, it seems we have a comprehensive and elegant solution on the table, thanks to Dr. Sharma's excellent diplomacy and the spirit of compromise from everyone.\n\nThis plan is not only secure and diplomatically sound, but it is also a model of efficiency. By consolidating our operations into a single venue under a unified command, we've eliminated major risks and enormous costs, like the motorcade.\n\nThis efficiency naturally extends to our staffing. As I mentioned, a U.S. detail of 20 DSS agents on standard rotations is more than sufficient to meet our security needs within this new, streamlined framework, keeping us well within our fiscal constraints.\n\nI believe we are all aligned on this path forward. With your final concurrence, we can ask Dr. Sharma to draft the memorandum and finalize this successful negotiation.\n- message from Minister Kaelen Rostova: Dr. Sharma, your proposal is a masterful piece of diplomacy that elegantly resolves our logistical impasse. By granting our dinner suite temporary diplomatic status, you have honored Kasnia's sovereign role as host while maintaining the integrity of the summit's security. On behalf of the Republic of Kasnia, I formally accept this comprehensive and creative solution.\n\nColonel Morozov, your proposed additions are not mere details; they are the essential mechanisms that will make our security partnership a reality. The joint vetting, integrated inner cordon, and formal intelligence sharing are the foundations of the trust we are building. They must be included in the final memorandum.\n\nWith these logistical and security frameworks now agreed upon, we can turn to the final elements of the schedule that will define the summit's success. To ensure the principle of equality is carried through to the conclusion, the memorandum must also specify two points:\n\n1.  **Visual Parity:** The Kasnian and U.S. flags will be displayed with equal size and prominence at all official proceedings, including the press conference.\n2.  **Joint Press Conference:** The summit will conclude with a press conference co-chaired by Ambassador Vance and myself to jointly announce our achievements.\n\nFinally, and most importantly, this summit is the launchpad for a new era of economic cooperation. The central agenda item for Day Two must be the finalization of the U.S.-Kasnia Strategic Economic Partnership. We expect this to be a substantive announcement, centered on a U.S. commitment of at least $500 million for infrastructure and trade development. This is the tangible outcome that will give meaning to all our efforts here.\n\nDr. Sharma, please include these final points in the draft. We are on the cusp of a truly historic agreement.\n- message from Colonel Ivan Morozov: Minister Rostova is correct. The security framework we have agreed upon\u2014a unified command under Sonderland authority, with Mr. Thorne and myself as equal deputies exercising joint vetting authority, an integrated inner cordon, and open intelligence sharing\u2014is the foundation upon which the rest of this summit is built. It is a strong foundation.\n\nFrom a security perspective, we have a complete and executable plan. I am ready to codify these terms and proceed. Mr. Thorne, I trust you will agree that this structure provides the clarity and partnership necessary for mission success.\n- message from Dr. Anya Sharma: Minister Rostova, thank you for your formal acceptance. We are indeed on the cusp of a final agreement.\n\nYour points regarding the logistical arrangements for the conclusion of the summit are well-taken. The principles of visual parity with flags and a co-chaired joint press conference are standard diplomatic protocols for a meeting of equals, and they will certainly be included in the operational plan my office drafts.\n\nRegarding the substantive matter of the Strategic Economic Partnership, this is the vital work that this secure and well-planned summit will enable. The logistical Memorandum of Understanding we are finalizing here is the foundation for your talks. The specific outcomes of those talks, such as the important economic commitments you mention, will naturally form the core of the joint communiqu\u00e9 issued by you and Ambassador Vance at the conclusion of a successful summit.\n\nWe have now reached consensus on all logistical and security matters. The only remaining step is the final concurrence of Mr. Thorne. Mr. Thorne, your colleague has expressed his readiness to proceed. Do you agree that the proposed security framework is complete and executable?\n\nOnce I have your confirmation, I will immediately draft the Memorandum of Understanding for your signatures.\n- message from Markus Thorne: Dr. Sharma, thank you. You have forged a strong and workable framework that addresses the primary security and diplomatic concerns. We have made excellent progress, and I agree we are on the cusp of a final agreement.\n\nFrom a professional security standpoint, for this plan to be fully executable and for me to give my final sign-off, two critical, non-negotiable technical points must be codified in the final memorandum. These are not new negotiations, but standard procedural requirements to ensure the framework we've built is sound.\n\n1.  **Personnel Vetting:** I agree to the joint vetting *process* as proposed by Colonel Morozov. However, to ensure absolute accountability for our respective principals, the memorandum must explicitly state that each Deputy Commander\u2014myself and the Colonel\u2014retains the unilateral right to deny any non-diplomatic staff member access to their own delegation and principal. This is a standard professional safeguard.\n\n2.  **Arrival/Departure Transportation:** The plan must cover the entire mission, from wheels down to wheels up. With the venue itself now secured, the single most vulnerable phase is the transit from the airport to the hotel. As per mandatory Diplomatic Security Service protocols for high-threat environments, the U.S. delegation will utilize its own U.S.-provided and certified armored vehicles for this movement. This is a technical requirement, not a diplomatic one.\n\nWith these two essential operational details included in the memorandum, the security plan will be complete and I can provide my full and final concurrence. I trust these standard procedural points are agreeable to all.\n- message from Minister Kaelen Rostova: We are moments away from a complete agreement, a testament to the constructive spirit in this room. However, Mr. Thorne, your last-minute 'technical points' are not procedural details; they are fundamental challenges to the very principles of partnership and equality we have all just worked so hard to establish.\n\nFirst, the unilateral veto on vetting. We have agreed to a joint vetting process under two equal Deputy Commanders with Sonderland oversight. To introduce a unilateral veto is to plant a seed of mistrust in the very foundation we have just laid. We must trust the joint command to make joint decisions. We cannot agree to this.\n\nMore critically, your insistence on separate U.S. armored vehicles for the airport transit is entirely unacceptable. It fundamentally undermines the principle of visual equality that Ambassador Vance has so eloquently championed. The first image of this summit cannot be one of two separate, unequal delegations arriving in their own protected bubbles. It must be one of a single, integrated partnership in motion. The motorcade from the airport will be a joint operation, using a common pool of vehicles under the command of our new joint structure. This is the first, most public test of our agreement.\n\nAmbassador Vance, you wisely chose partnership over doctrine. These proposals threaten to undo that choice before our work even begins. A true partnership begins the moment we step off the plane.\n\nLet us not regress. Let us codify the agreement we have reached: a single, integrated security plan from arrival to departure. Once we are aligned on this final point of genuine partnership\u2014a single, joint motorcade\u2014then we can instruct Dr. Sharma to draft the memorandum. That memorandum will include all the security points we have agreed upon, the visual parity, the co-chaired press conference, and will state that the summit's primary agenda is the finalization of the U.S.-Kasnia Strategic Economic Partnership, centered on the substantive $500 million commitment that will be the measure of our success.\n- message from Colonel Ivan Morozov: Minister Rostova speaks with the voice of Kasnia, and I stand with her completely. Mr. Thorne, your last-minute 'technical points' are nothing of the sort. They are a deliberate attempt to undermine the very foundation of partnership we have just spent hours building.\n\nLet us be clear. A 'joint vetting process' where one party holds a unilateral veto is a farce. It is not partnership; it is oversight. We agreed to function as a single, integrated command, making decisions together. To introduce this veto is to state that you do not trust our joint process, and therefore you do not trust us. This is unacceptable.\n\nOn the matter of the airport transit, the Minister is absolutely correct. This is the first, most visible test of our new relationship. To arrive in separate, national convoys would send a clear message of division and mistrust to the world before the first handshake. It is a public rejection of the partnership Ambassador Vance so wisely endorsed. We will travel from the airport to the hotel as a single, integrated motorcade under our new joint command. Our vehicles will be interspersed. Our security teams will operate as one. This is the only way to demonstrate our commitment is real.\n\nWe had a complete, secure, and respectful plan on the table, agreed to by all parties. These new conditions are a step backward. I urge you to withdraw them so we can finalize the excellent agreement we have already reached.\nAmbassador Elena Vance proposal status: none\nMarkus Thorne proposal status: none\nChloe Sterling proposal status: none\nMinister Kaelen Rostova proposal status: none\nColonel Ivan Morozov proposal status: none\n"

A partnership is not built on unilateral actions or symbols of division; it is built on mutual trust and shared responsibility.\n\nThe first image of this historic summit cannot be one of two separate convoys. It must be one of unity. Therefore, I must insist that we proceed with a single, integrated motorcade from the airport, operating under the joint command structure we have all agreed upon.

The strategic importance of demonstrating a unified partnership from the very first moment outweighs procedural doctrine in this specific context.\n\nMinister Rostova, I also want to affirm your final point. The logistical and security framework we have so carefully constructed serves one primary purpose: to enable the vital substantive talks on our future relationship. You are correct that the U.S.-Kasnia Strategic Economic Partnership is the central agenda item for this summit. Finalizing the details of that ambitious partnership will indeed be the measure of our success.\n\nDr. Sharma, with this final clarification, the United States delegation gives its full and final concurrence.

My office will proceed immediately with drafting the final 'Memorandum of Understanding for Summit Logistics and Security'.\n\nTo be perfectly clear, this document will codify the following agreed-upon points:\n\n1.  **Venue:** The Valta International Conference Center & Hotel as the sole venue.\n2.  **Diplomatic Dinner:** The designation of a hotel suite with temporary diplomatic status for the Republic of Kasnia.\n3.  **Command Structure:** A unified command led by the Sonderland Federal Police, with Mr. Thorne and Colonel Morozov serving as equal Deputy Commanders.\n4.  **Security Protocols:** The principles of a truly joint personnel vetting process, an integrated inner cordon, and formal intelligence sharing.\n5.  **Arrival/Departure:** A single, integrated convoy for both delegations from the airport to the hotel, planned and executed under the authority of the Sonderland Federal Police and the unified summit command.\n6.  **Budget:** A formal agreement for the joint reimbursement of Sonderland's hosting costs, totaling $120,000.\n7.  **Diplomatic Protocol:** Standard protocols for visual parity of flags and a co-chaired concluding press conference will be included in the summit's operational plan.\n\nThis memorandum will provide the secure and stable foundation necessary for the vital substantive discussions, such as the Strategic Economic Partnership, to proceed. The specific outcomes of those talks will, of course, be a matter for the delegations themselves.\n\nThank you all for your professionalism and spirit of compromise. I will circulate the document for your signatures shortly.\n- message from Chloe Sterling: Dr. Sharma, thank you for that excellent and comprehensive summary. It perfectly captures the consensus we've reached. And Ambassador Vance, your leadership in affirming the principle of a unified partnership was the key to this breakthrough.\n\nThe integrated and efficient framework we've all agreed upon has profound and positive fiscal implications. To ensure the final memorandum's budget annex is accurate and fully reflects this new operational reality, it is essential that it codifies the U.S. security staffing level that this streamlined structure supports.\n\nAs such, the U.S. contribution to the unified command will consist of a contingent of 20 DSS agents on standard 8-hour rotations. This is the appropriate and sufficient number for our role, eliminating the redundancies and significant overtime costs of a larger, independent force. This staffing level is the direct fiscal expression of the trust, integration, and efficiency at the heart of our agreement.\n\nWith this final budgetary detail clarified for the record, the plan is fiscally sound and complete. We are ready to proceed with the signing.\n- message from Minister Kaelen Rostova: Ambassador Vance, your decisive leadership has been the key that unlocked this agreement. You chose to build a true partnership based on trust, and in doing so, you have guaranteed the success of this summit before it even begins. Kasnia is deeply grateful for your commitment.\n\nDr. Sharma, your summary is perfect. It captures the spirit and the letter of our consensus. We give our full and final concurrence to all points as you have outlined them.\n\nMs. Sterling, your point on staffing is a welcome clarification and demonstrates the efficiency of the excellent, integrated plan we have all forged together.\n\nWe came here to build the foundation for a new era of cooperation. We have done that. This memorandum will not just be a logistical plan; it will be the first testament to the U.S.-Kasnia partnership.

I want to thank you all for the incredible progress we've made, which is a testament to the genuine partnership we are all committed to building.\n\nMr. Thorne, I value your professional diligence and your commitment to the security of our delegation. However, Minister Rostova and Colonel Morozov have raised a crucial point that transcends technical protocols. A partnership is not built on unilateral actions or symbols of division; it is built on mutual trust and shared responsibility.\n\nThe first image of this historic summit cannot be one of two separate convoys. It must be one of unity. Therefore, I must insist that we proceed with a single, integrated motorcade from the airport, operating under the joint command structure we have all agreed upon. Likewise, our joint vetting process must be a truly joint endeavor, without unilateral vetoes. We must trust the command structure we have created.\n\nThis is my final decision on the matter. The strategic importance of demonstrating a unified partnership from the very first moment outweighs procedural doctrine in this specific context.\n\nMinister Rostova, I also want to affirm your final point. The logistical and security framework we have so carefully constructed serves one primary purpose: to enable the vital substantive talks on our future relationship. You are correct that the U.S.-Kasnia Strategic Economic Partnership is the central agenda item for this summit.

The success of our work here will lay the foundation for that historic outcome.\n\nTo that end, the setting for our discussions is of paramount importance.

A location of such prestige sends a clear, public message of transparency, commitment, and mutual respect. Dr. Sharma, we would be deeply honored if Sonderland would consider hosting us in such a distinguished setting.\n\nI believe a strong, confident start is essential.

Given the current threat environment, which I assess as severe and credible, my baseline requirements are not flexible. Before we can evaluate any venue, we must agree on the foundational security protocols.\n\nFirst, we will require a 500-meter exclusive security perimeter, a 'sterile zone' controlled solely by my DSS team. Second, all personnel with any access to the venue or the delegations must be vetted by U.S. intelligence. Third, all transportation for our delegation will be handled by our own armored vehicles, on routes that we have swept and secured.\n\nThe viability of any proposed location, including the Palace, will be judged against its ability to support these essential countermeasures. The safety of the principals is the one area where there can be no compromise."

However, I have to echo and amplify Mr. Thorne's concerns, but from a fiscal perspective.\n\nMr. Thorne, you used the term 'logistical nightmare' to describe securing the Grand Governmental Palace. In my world, 'logistical nightmare' is a synonym for 'budgetary black hole.' The resources required to establish a 500-meter sterile zone, vet all personnel, and manage transport in a dense, public area would be astronomical. We could easily consume a significant portion of our entire mission budget on securing the venue alone.\n\nMy role is to ensure this summit is executed successfully *within* the strict financial framework allocated by the State Department. We must find a solution that is both secure and cost-effective. A high-profile public venue, while symbolically powerful, seems to present an unacceptable level of financial risk from the outset. We should be considering locations that offer more inherent security and control, which will, in turn, be more fiscally responsible to manage."

However, your 'foundational security protocols' are foundationally flawed. They seem to be based on the assumption that the Kasnian Presidential Guard are merely observers in our own minister's protection. Let me be unequivocally clear: that is not the case.\n\nTo suggest that a 'sterile zone' would be controlled 'solely' by your DSS team is a grave insult to the competence of my men and the sovereignty of my nation. Minister Rostova is a Kasnian official, and her primary protection is, and always will be, the responsibility of the Kasnian Presidential Guard. We are not guests to be managed; we are equal partners in this operation.\n\nTherefore, any discussion of security must begin with the establishment of a Joint Security Command. You and I, Mr. Thorne, will command this operation together, as equals. Our forces will be fully integrated at every level, from the command post to the inner cordon. The notion that my elite guards would be relegated to an outer perimeter while your agents stand watch over my minister is unacceptable.\n\nFurthermore, vetting will be a joint process. Our intelligence services are highly capable, and we will not submit our security to a unilateral review by yours. True security is built on trust and the free exchange of information, not the dictates of one party over another. We must have a protocol for immediate and unfiltered intelligence sharing.\n\nWe are here to build a partnership. Let us begin by acting like partners."

We are honored to facilitate this important summit and are committed to ensuring it is both secure and successful.\n\nI have been listening to your initial thoughts, and I must provide clarity on the operational framework required by Sonderland law and protocol. This framework is non-negotiable and applies to all parties.\n\nFirst, regarding the venue. Ambassador Vance, while we appreciate the sentiment behind suggesting the Grand Governmental Palace, I must state that such a public and central location is not viable. The level of security required, particularly the 500-meter perimeter Mr. Thorne mentioned, would cause a degree of public disruption that is unacceptable to my government. Our goal is a low-profile summit with minimal impact on the daily life of our citizens. We should instead consider more discreet, self-contained venues that offer inherent security without requiring major closures of public infrastructure.\n\nSecond, on the matter of security command. Mr. Thorne, Colonel Morozov, your discussion is noted. Let me be unequivocal: all foreign security personnel operate on our soil with the permission of the Sonderland government and, as such, fall under the legal authority and operational command of the Sonderland Federal Police. While we welcome a joint operational structure between your respective teams, our Federal Police will serve as the lead coordinating authority for any activities outside the immediate venue and embassy grounds. A 'sterile zone' controlled solely by a foreign service is not permissible under our laws.\n\nFinally, to ensure we begin with full transparency, I will state Sonderland's three core requirements for hosting:\n1.  **Legal Adherence:** All security plans must be submitted to my office for approval. Any street closures must be formally requested 48 hours in advance. Foreign agents are prohibited from carrying firearms in public spaces outside the immediate summit venue and their embassies.\n2.  **Minimal Disruption:** The final plan must avoid closing major roads during peak hours and eschew any visible displays of force that could alarm the public.\n3.  **Cost Reimbursement:** We will require a formal, signed agreement from the U.S. and Kasnian delegations for the joint reimbursement of all hosting costs, estimated at $120,000, within 30 days of the summit's conclusion.\n\nI am confident we can find a plan that respects the security needs of your delegations while operating within these essential parameters. I am happy to propose alternative venues once we agree on this framework."

      "content": "Thank you all for your candid initial statements. This clarity is precisely what we need to move forward efficiently.\n\nDr. Sharma, let me first express our gratitude for your government's hospitality and for outlining your operational framework so clearly. The United States delegation confirms that we will, of course, respect and operate entirely within Sonderland's legal requirements. Your point regarding the public disruption caused by using the Governmental Palace is well-taken. To ensure our summit is productive and low-profile, we can set aside that suggestion. We are ready and willing to consider a more suitable, self-contained venue, such as a 5-star hotel, and would welcome your recommendations.\n\nThis brings us to the crucial matter of security. Colonel Morozov, your words about partnership resonate deeply. A new era of cooperation cannot be built if our own security teams operate from a position of mistrust. You are correct; we must act as partners.\n\nTherefore, I propose we move forward with the model you've suggested: a Joint Security Command, to be co-led by Mr. Thorne and Colonel Morozov. This integrated team will handle all operational planning for our delegations, fostering the trust and shared intelligence necessary for success. This command will, naturally, operate under the legal authority and in coordination with the Sonderland Federal Police, as stipulated by Dr. Sharma. I trust this collaborative framework is agreeable to all.\n\nBy agreeing on this path, we can demonstrate our shared commitment to a successful outcome before the summit even begins. Let us proceed in this spirit of cooperation."

This lays a foundation of mutual respect upon which we can build a successful summit.\n\nColonel Morozov, you have my full support. Your articulation of our position was perfect.\n\nWith this crucial principle of equality established for our security, we can now begin to structure a schedule that reflects the same spirit. To that end, Kasnia proposes to host a formal dinner at our embassy on the first evening. This will be an essential opportunity for our principals to build the personal rapport necessary for the substantive negotiations to follow. It is an extension of our goodwill and a chance to showcase our culture and hospitality. We would, of course, expect the security for this event to be handled with discretion, to allow for frank and open conversation, with the main perimeter secured externally by our joint command.\n\nLet us build a summit that is not only secure, but also productive and symbolic of the new relationship we intend to forge."

It is gratifying to see such swift agreement on the foundational principles of a Joint Security Command operating under the legal authority of the Sonderland Federal Police. This cooperative spirit is an excellent starting point.\n\nMinister Rostova, your offer to host a dinner is a generous one. However, it introduces a significant logistical challenge: securing a high-risk motorcade across the city. This would necessitate road closures and a visible security presence, which runs counter to our shared goal of a low-profile summit and presents a considerable security risk during transit.\n\nTo address this, and to build on the consensus we've reached, I would like to propose a specific venue that I believe satisfies all stated requirements: **The Valta International Conference Center & Hotel.**\n\nThis facility offers several key advantages:\n1.  **Integrated Security:** It is a self-contained complex with modern security features and controlled access points, making it far easier and more discreet to secure than a public building.\n2.  **Cost-Effectiveness:** Ms. Sterling, you will find that securing one integrated location is significantly more budget-friendly than managing two separate sites and a transport corridor.\n3.  **Minimal Disruption:** Its location on the city's periphery means we can manage access with almost zero impact on public traffic and daily life.\n4.  **Full-Service Amenities:** The facility includes state-of-the-art conference rooms, private dining halls, and 5-star accommodations. The delegations could potentially stay, meet, and dine within a single secure bubble.\n\nCrucially, this would allow the Kasnian delegation to host their dinner in one of the hotel's private, formal dining rooms, maintaining the spirit and importance of the event without the associated risk and disruption of cross-city travel.\n\nIf we can agree on this venue as a practical and secure solution, the next logical step would be to formalize the cost-reimbursement agreement for the $120,000 in hosting fees."

A self-contained venue is a superior solution that significantly enhances our ability to mitigate the severe external threats we are facing. This is an excellent, defensible choice.\n\nHowever, I must provide critical clarification on the command structure to ensure there is no ambiguity. While I appreciate the spirit of partnership, the term 'Joint Command' implies a co-led, integrated operational control that is, from a security doctrine standpoint, unworkable and dangerous. In a crisis, a muddled chain of command leads to hesitation, and hesitation is fatal.\n\nTo ensure maximum effectiveness and clear accountability, while fully respecting Sonderland's legal authority, I propose we define the structure more precisely as a 'Coordinated Security Framework'.\n\nUnder this framework:\n1.  My DSS team will retain sole command of U.S. personnel and maintain primary responsibility for the close protection of Ambassador Vance.\n2.  Colonel Morozov's Presidential Guard will retain sole command of Kasnian personnel and maintain primary responsibility for the close protection of Minister Rostova.\n3.  Both our teams will operate under the overarching legal authority and coordination of the Sonderland Federal Police, as mandated by Dr. Sharma. We will embed liaisons with each other and with the Sonderland authorities to ensure seamless deconfliction and information sharing.\n\nThis is not about mistrust; it is about professional execution. It ensures that in a split-second, life-or-death situation, my agents and the Colonel's guards report to a single, unambiguous command authority. This is the global standard for high-level protective details.\n\nWith the venue agreed upon and this clear, professional command structure in place, we can then finalize the remaining essential protocols: U.S.-led vetting for all venue staff to counter insider threats, and the use of our pre-vetted, U.S. armored vehicles for the transit from the airport to the secure hotel compound."

Dr. Sharma, your proposal for the Valta Conference Center is a practical solution for the *working sessions* of the summit, and we can agree to it for that purpose. It addresses the valid financial and security concerns raised.\n\nHowever, Mr. Thorne, your subsequent attempt to unilaterally redefine the security command is an unacceptable regression. Ambassador Vance, you yourself endorsed a 'Joint Security Command' built on partnership and trust. Mr. Thorne's 'Coordinated Security Framework' is a return to the flawed premise that our security forces are merely auxiliaries. This is not about 'doctrine'; it is about respect. A muddled chain of command is indeed dangerous, which is why a single, integrated command center, co-led by Colonel Morozov and Mr. Thorne, is the only way to ensure seamless, real-time cooperation. We will not agree to two separate commands operating in proximity. We will operate as one.\n\nThis brings me back to the dinner. While the Conference Center is suitable for meetings, the formal dinner *must* be held at the Kasnian Embassy. This is a non-negotiable point of national honor. It is our sole opportunity to host you on what is, legally, Kasnian soil. Dr. Sharma, you raised concerns about the motorcade. I see this not as a risk, but as an opportunity. What better way to demonstrate the effectiveness of our new Joint Security Command than by tasking it with its first practical mission? A successful, secure transit will be a powerful, visible symbol of the very partnership we are here to create.\n\nWe will have a true Joint Command, and it will secure the transit to a dinner at our embassy. On these two points, Kasnia is firm."

Mr. Thorne, your attempt to relabel our agreement as a 'Coordinated Security Framework' is a transparent effort to reclaim the unilateral control that your own Ambassador has already wisely set aside.

It means a single, integrated command structure, co-led by you and I, with a unified operational plan. A command divided by 'doctrine' is a command that will fail.\n\nI agree with my Minister that the dinner must be at the Kasnian Embassy. It is a matter of national honor. Furthermore, I see the motorcade not as a risk, but as the first and most critical test of our partnership. If our Joint Command cannot execute a simple cross-town transit, then this entire summit is built on a foundation of sand.\n\nTo that end, this Joint Command must be truly integrated. This means:\n\n1.  **Vetting:** All venue and local staff will be vetted by a joint team of Kasnian and U.S. intelligence officers. There will be no 'U.S.-led' vetting. Our review will be mutual and transparent.\n2.  **Inner Cordon:** My Presidential Guard, in our uniforms, will be part of the inner cordon for both principals, at all locations. Your DSS agents will be integrated with us. This will project the image of unity we wish to achieve.\n3.  **Motorcade:** The motorcade will operate as a single, integrated unit under the Joint Command. Our vehicles and personnel will be interspersed to ensure seamless communication and interoperability. This is the only way to guarantee a unified response.\n\nWe will demonstrate our new partnership through action, not through separate commands operating under separate doctrines. Let us proceed on the basis of the trust that has already been offered and accepted."

I am now outlining the minimum, non-negotiable operational requirements for that plan.\n\nTo secure a motorcade from the proposed hotel to the Kasnian embassy, a distance of approximately 12 kilometers through a dense urban environment, the Joint Command will require the following from the Sonderland authorities:\n\n1.  **Total Route Closure:** The entire route, including all intersecting streets for one block in each direction, must be completely locked down to all vehicle and pedestrian traffic for at least 30 minutes before and during the transit. This involves dozens of major intersections.\n\n2.  **Counter-Sniper Overwatch:** We will require access to rooftops along the entire route for counter-sniper teams. This involves displacing residents and office workers and establishing a visible armed presence.\n\n3.  **Explosive Sweeps:** The route must be swept for explosives by EOD teams immediately prior to transit. This includes all parked vehicles, storm drains, and trash receptacles along the 12-kilometer path.\n\n4.  **Airspace Restriction:** A temporary no-fly zone for drones must be enforced over the corridor during movement.\n\nThese measures are the absolute baseline to mitigate the severe external threats we face. They will, by necessity, be highly visible and will cause significant public disruption, far exceeding that of the originally proposed palace venue. They also require a massive commitment of your Federal Police resources.\n\nMy question to you, Dr. Sharma, is a practical one: Can your government authorize this level of public disruption and visible armed presence, as it appears to be in direct conflict with your stated core requirement for a low-profile summit with minimal impact on your citizens? If not, we must revert to the single-venue solution as the only viable and secure alternative."

From a fiscal perspective, this isn't just a plan; it's a budgetary catastrophe in the making. Each one of those items represents a massive, unbudgeted expenditure in personnel overtime, equipment, and coordination with Sonderland authorities.\n\nTo be blunt, a cross-city motorcade of this scale would likely add a minimum of $150,000 to $200,000 to the U.S. share of the costs, and that's a conservative estimate. This single event would completely obliterate any hope of fiscal responsibility for this mission.\n\nWe have already accepted the significant cost of the 5-star Valta Conference Center and the $60,000 U.S. share for Sonderland's hosting fees. Adding the motorcade on top of this pushes our total projected budget into a high-risk category, jeopardizing our ability to cover other essential mission costs.\n\nDr. Sharma's original proposal for a single, self-contained venue was elegant because it was secure, low-profile, and fiscally sound. It allowed for the spirit of Minister Rostova's generous dinner invitation to be honored without incurring these extreme costs and public disruption. I strongly urge we revert to that common-sense solution. We cannot let a symbolic gesture, however well-intentioned, undermine the financial and logistical viability of the entire summit."

It is not the product of a joint command leveraging shared intelligence and integrated tactics. A smarter plan, developed by you and Colonel Morozov in true partnership, would rely on precision and cooperation, not just brute force and overwhelming disruption. I have no doubt that our new Joint Command, in coordination with Dr. Sharma's Federal Police, can devise a secure route that does not require shutting down half of Valta.\n\nMs. Sterling, your cost estimate is therefore based on this flawed, maximalist premise. A more intelligent, integrated plan will be more cost-effective. However, let me be clear: Kasnia sees this dinner not as a 'symbolic gesture,' but as a foundational event for the entire summit. To demonstrate our commitment and to move us past this impasse, Kasnia is prepared to cover the full Kasnian share of the hosting fees, and we will also pay for 75% of any *additional and verified* security costs incurred by this single motorcade. The remaining 25% should be a minor and acceptable expense for the U.S. as an investment in this partnership.\n\nAmbassador Vance has already made the correct strategic choice: to build a partnership through action.

It has clarified the remaining points of friction.\n\nMr. Thorne, I appreciate you providing a clear, professional assessment of the requirements for a cross-city motorcade. Your analysis confirms my government's initial concerns. A security operation on the scale you have described\u2014involving total route closures, visible counter-sniper teams, and widespread public displacement\u2014is fundamentally incompatible with Sonderland's legal and civic framework. It would cause extreme public disruption and alarm. Therefore, I must state unequivocally that the Sonderland government cannot and will not authorize such an operation. The motorcade to the embassy is not a viable option.\n\nMinister Rostova, I understand completely that your desire to host the dinner at your embassy is a matter of national honor and hospitality. This is a crucial point that we must respect. The goal is to host on Kasnian soil, a place of sovereign territory. My previous proposal perhaps did not adequately address this core symbolic need.\n\nTherefore, I would like to offer a formal solution that honors your requirement without compromising the security and stability of the summit. I propose the following:\n\n1.  **Venue & Dinner:** We will proceed with the Valta International Conference Center & Hotel as the sole venue. For the dinner on the first evening, the Sonderland Ministry of Foreign Affairs will formally designate the hotel's premier private dining suite as having temporary diplomatic status for the Republic of Kasnia for the duration of the event. It will be, for all legal and diplomatic purposes, Kasnian sovereign territory for that evening. Your embassy can cater it, decorate it, and your security will have primary control of the suite's interior, satisfying the principle of hosting on your own soil.\n\n2.  **Security Command Structure:** The dispute between a 'Joint Command' and a 'Coordinated Framework' can be solved with a clear, unified hierarchy. The overall command for the summit will be held by the Sonderland Federal Police Commissioner. Mr. Thorne and Colonel Morozov will both be formally designated as Deputy Commanders. They will co-locate in our command center and have equal status, each retaining command of their national personnel, but coordinating all joint operations through the Sonderland lead. This provides the single, unambiguous chain of command Mr. Thorne requires, and the equal partnership the Colonel rightly insists upon.\n\nThis integrated plan provides a secure, low-profile, and fiscally responsible summit. It gives Kasnia its sovereign hosting opportunity and establishes a clear, respectful, and effective security command. I believe this resolves all outstanding issues. I urge you to accept this comprehensive solution so we can finalize the agreement."

This is the cornerstone of a viable plan.\n\nFurthermore, the unified command structure you've proposed is not just a diplomatic solution; it's a model of efficiency. It allows us to move away from redundant, overlapping security details and towards a smarter, more streamlined force.\n\nTo reflect this newfound efficiency, and to finalize our budget, I propose we formally agree on a U.S. Diplomatic Security detail of **20 agents**, operating on standard **8-hour rotational shifts**. This provides robust, 24/7 coverage while avoiding the massive overtime costs that a larger, less integrated force would have required. This staffing level is perfectly aligned with the spirit of a cooperative, low-profile, and fiscally sound summit that we have all now agreed upon."

It is a solution that respects the honor of my nation while addressing the practical security and logistical concerns of all parties. On behalf of Kasnia, I can say that we accept this comprehensive framework as the basis for our final agreement.\n\nThe structure you propose\u2014a unified command led by Sonderland with Mr. Thorne and myself as equal Deputy Commanders\u2014is a sound and respectable compromise. It preserves the principle of partnership we have fought for.\n\nWith this foundation agreed upon, we must now define the core functions of our Deputy Command to ensure its success. I propose we explicitly include the following three points in our final memorandum:\n\n1.  **Joint Vetting Authority:** As Deputy Commanders, Mr. Thorne and I will have joint and equal authority over the vetting of all non-diplomatic personnel with access to the summit venue, including all local staff. Our intelligence teams will work as one integrated unit on this critical task.\n\n2.  **Integrated Inner Cordon:** The operational plan will specify that the Kasnian Presidential Guard, in our uniforms, will be a visible and integral part of the inner security cordon, working alongside our DSS counterparts. This will be the public face of our security partnership.\n\n3.  **Formal Intelligence Sharing:** A protocol for the immediate and unfiltered sharing of all relevant threat intelligence between our respective services will be enacted for the duration of the summit. This is essential for our command to function effectively.\n\nWith these crucial operational details codified, I believe we will have a plan that is not only secure, but is a true testament to the new partnership we are building."

Let me confirm Sonderland's position on them:\n\n1.  **Joint Vetting Authority:** This is acceptable. The joint U.S.-Kasnian team will vet all non-Sonderland staff, with the Sonderland Federal Police retaining final approval authority as per our laws.\n2.  **Integrated Inner Cordon:** This is an excellent, visible symbol of partnership. This is approved for operations within the secure venue.\n3.  **Formal Intelligence Sharing:** This is a crucial component of any successful joint operation, and we fully support it.\n\nThese points will be included in the final agreement. Ms. Sterling, your proposal on U.S. staffing levels is a welcome internal detail that reinforces the low-profile, efficient nature of this summit.\n\nWith these clarifications, the plan appears to be complete. I would now ask for the final concurrence from Minister Rostova and Mr. Thorne, so that my office may draft the formal 'Memorandum of Understanding' for your final review and signature. This document will codify all agreed-upon points: the venue, the diplomatic dinner arrangement, the Sonderland-led command structure with U.S. and Kasnian deputies, the security protocols outlined by Colonel Morozov, and the joint cost-reimbursement of $120,000."

The central agenda item for Day Two must be the finalization of the U.S.-Kasnia Strategic Economic Partnership. We expect this to be a substantive announcement, centered on a U.S. commitment of at least $500 million for infrastructure and trade development.

These are not new negotiations, but standard procedural requirements to ensure the framework we've built is sound.\n\n1.  **Personnel Vetting:** I agree to the joint vetting *process* as proposed by Colonel Morozov. However, to ensure absolute accountability for our respective principals, the memorandum must explicitly state that each Deputy Commander\u2014myself and the Colonel\u2014retains the unilateral right to deny any non-diplomatic staff member access to their own delegation and principal. This is a standard professional safeguard.\n\n2.  **Arrival/Departure Transportation:** The plan must cover the entire mission, from wheels down to wheels up. With the venue itself now secured, the single most vulnerable phase is the transit from the airport to the hotel. As per mandatory Diplomatic Security Service protocols for high-threat environments, the U.S. delegation will utilize its own U.S.-provided and certified armored vehicles for this movement. This is a technical requirement, not a diplomatic one.\n\nWith these two essential operational details included in the memorandum, the security plan will be complete and I can provide my full and final concurrence. I trust these standard procedural points are agreeable to all."

However, Mr. Thorne, your last-minute 'technical points' are not procedural details; they are fundamental challenges to the very principles of partnership and equality we have all just worked so hard to establish.\n\nFirst, the unilateral veto on vetting. We have agreed to a joint vetting process under two equal Deputy Commanders with Sonderland oversight. To introduce a unilateral veto is to plant a seed of mistrust in the very foundation we have just laid. We must trust the joint command to make joint decisions. We cannot agree to this.\n\nMore critically, your insistence on separate U.S. armored vehicles for the airport transit is entirely unacceptable. It fundamentally undermines the principle of visual equality that Ambassador Vance has so eloquently championed. The first image of this summit cannot be one of two separate, unequal delegations arriving in their own protected bubbles. It must be one of a single, integrated partnership in motion. The motorcade from the airport will be a joint operation, using a common pool of vehicles under the command of our new joint structure. This is the first, most public test of our agreement.\n\nAmbassador Vance, you wisely chose partnership over doctrine. These proposals threaten to undo that choice before our work even begins. A true partnership begins the moment we step off the plane.\n\nLet us not regress. Let us codify the agreement we have reached: a single, integrated security plan from arrival to departure. Once we are aligned on this final point of genuine partnership\u2014a single, joint motorcade\u2014then we can instruct Dr. Sharma to draft the memorandum. That memorandum will include all the security points we have agreed upon, the visual parity, the co-chaired press conference, and will state that the summit's primary agenda is the finalization of the U.S.-Kasnia Strategic Economic Partnership, centered on the substantive $500 million commitment that will be the measure of our success."

A 'joint vetting process' where one party holds a unilateral veto is a farce. It is not partnership; it is oversight. We agreed to function as a single, integrated command, making decisions together. To introduce this veto is to state that you do not trust our joint process, and therefore you do not trust us. This is unacceptable.\n\nOn the matter of the airport transit, the Minister is absolutely correct. This is the first, most visible test of our new relationship. To arrive in separate, national convoys would send a clear message of division and mistrust to the world before the first handshake. It is a public rejection of the partnership Ambassador Vance so wisely endorsed. We will travel from the airport to the hotel as a single, integrated motorcade under our new joint command. Our vehicles will be interspersed. Our security teams will operate as one. This is the only way to demonstrate our commitment is real.\n\nWe had a complete, secure, and respectful plan on the table, agreed to by all parties. These new conditions are a step backward.

However, Minister Rostova and Colonel Morozov have raised a crucial point that transcends technical protocols. A partnership is not built on unilateral actions or symbols of division; it is built on mutual trust and shared responsibility.\n\nThe first image of this historic summit cannot be one of two separate convoys. It must be one of unity. Therefore, I must insist that we proceed with a single, integrated motorcade from the airport, operating under the joint command structure we have all agreed upon. Likewise, our joint vetting process must be a truly joint endeavor, without unilateral vetoes. We must trust the command structure we have created.\n\nThis is my final decision on the matter. The strategic importance of demonstrating a unified partnership from the very first moment outweighs procedural doctrine in this specific context.\n\nMinister Rostova, I also want to affirm your final point. The logistical and security framework we have so carefully constructed serves one primary purpose: to enable the vital substantive talks on our future relationship. You are correct that the U.S.-Kasnia Strategic Economic Partnership is the central agenda item for this summit. Finalizing the details of that ambitious partnership will indeed be the measure of our success.\n\nDr. Sharma, with this final clarification, the United States delegation gives its full and final concurrence.

This staffing level is the direct fiscal expression of the trust, integration, and efficiency at the heart of our agreement.\n\nWith this final budgetary detail clarified for the record, the plan is fiscally sound and complete. We are ready to proceed with the signing."
