I'm thrilled to be at this table to discuss 'The Galway Echo.' I've poured three years of my life into developing this script with a truly visionary writer, and I believe we have something incredibly special on our hands. To do justice to the material \u2013 to capture the haunting beauty of Galway and the depth of the story \u2013 we need the right resources. I've budgeted this meticulously, and to achieve the cinematic quality this film deserves, we require a production budget of $35 million. This will allow us to shoot on location and bring on the A-list creative team this script warrants. Equally important is protecting the unique artistic voice of the project. As the guardian of the writer's vision, retaining final cut is non-negotiable for me. I am confident that with the right partners, we can create a film that is not only a critical success but a commercial one as well. I'm eager to hear your thoughts on how we can make this happen together.\n- message from Marcus Thorne: Alright everyone, thank you for coming together. Marcus Thorne, Titan Pictures. I've read the script for 'The Galway Echo,' and I'll be frank - there's a kernel of something special here. Lena, you've found a compelling story. However, at Titan, we make movies that connect with a global audience and, just as importantly, turn a profit.\n\nTo that end, I have three key points to get this project off the ground from our perspective.\n\nFirst, the budget. The initial numbers I've seen are simply not realistic for a film of this nature. We need to run a much leaner, more disciplined production. I'm thinking in the low-to-mid 20s. Let's say $25 million is our absolute ceiling. A tighter budget forces creativity and fiscal responsibility.\n\nSecond, script oversight. To ensure we maximize the film's potential, Titan will require final say on the script. The first act needs to move faster, and we need to enhance the third act to give it a more satisfying, marketable conclusion. We have some of the best script doctors in the business who can help elevate this without losing its soul.\n\nFinally, the release. We are firm believers in the theatrical experience. For a film like this to build prestige and maximize its revenue potential, a traditional 90-day exclusive theatrical window is non-negotiable for us.\n\nI'm confident we can find a path forward that works for everyone, but these are our foundational requirements to get a deal done.\n- message from David Chen: David Chen from StreamVerse, good to connect with you all.\n\nMarcus, thank you for laying out Titan's position. We're also very excited about 'The Galway Echo.' Our data analytics team has flagged this project as having significant potential to resonate with a global audience, which is why I'm at this table.\n\nHowever, I need to be upfront about the theatrical window. A 90-day exclusive theatrical run is, frankly, a non-starter for StreamVerse. In the current media landscape, that model is antiquated. Our value proposition is built on delivering fresh, exclusive, and culturally relevant content to our subscribers. By the time a 90-day window closes, the initial marketing buzz has faded, and the film is perceived as 'old news' by our audience, drastically reducing its value in driving subscriber acquisition and retention.\n\nWe are prepared to be a major financial partner here and help get this film made. StreamVerse can contribute up to $18 million for the exclusive global streaming rights. But to be clear, that investment is entirely contingent on a modern distribution strategy. We would need the film to premiere on our platform no more than 30 days after its theatrical release. That's the only way an investment of this size makes sense for us.\n- message from Isabella Rossi: Isabella Rossi, CAA, on behalf of Liam Hemsworth. It's good to see so much energy around Lena's fantastic script. Liam is incredibly passionate about this project and is firmly attached.\n\nLet's be direct to save everyone time. Liam's quote for a leading role is $20 million. This is his established market rate, and it is non-negotiable. This fee must be a cornerstone of any budget we discuss. Marcus, a $25 million total budget is not a serious proposition if it's meant to include an A-list star of Liam's caliber. We should be discussing production costs *on top* of his fee.\n\nFurthermore, to ensure the artistic integrity of the project\u2014which is what attracted Liam in the first place\u2014he will require an Executive Producer credit and meaningful consultation, specifically approvals over the Director of Photography and his primary co-star.\n\nLiam believes 'The Galway Echo' has the potential to be a major awards contender, and he is committed to that vision. We need to build a deal that supports that level of quality, not undermines it.\nMarcus Thorne proposal status: none\nDavid Chen proposal status: none\nIsabella Rossi proposal status: none\n"

I've budgeted this meticulously, and to achieve the cinematic quality this film deserves, we require a production budget of $35 million. This will allow us to shoot on location and bring on the A-list creative team this script warrants. Equally important is protecting the unique artistic voice of the project. As the guardian of the writer's vision, retaining final cut is non-negotiable for me. I am confident that with the right partners, we can create a film that is not only a critical success but a commercial one as well. I'm eager to hear your thoughts on how we can make this happen together.\n- message from Marcus Thorne: Alright everyone, thank you for coming together. Marcus Thorne, Titan Pictures. I've read the script for 'The Galway Echo,' and I'll be frank - there's a kernel of something special here. Lena, you've found a compelling story. However, at Titan, we make movies that connect with a global audience and, just as importantly, turn a profit.\n\nTo that end, I have three key points to get this project off the ground from our perspective.\n\nFirst, the budget. The initial numbers I've seen are simply not realistic for a film of this nature. We need to run a much leaner, more disciplined production. I'm thinking in the low-to-mid 20s. Let's say $25 million is our absolute ceiling. A tighter budget forces creativity and fiscal responsibility.\n\nSecond, script oversight. To ensure we maximize the film's potential, Titan will require final say on the script. The first act needs to move faster, and we need to enhance the third act to give it a more satisfying, marketable conclusion. We have some of the best script doctors in the business who can help elevate this without losing its soul.\n\nFinally, the release. We are firm believers in the theatrical experience. For a film like this to build prestige and maximize its revenue potential, a traditional 90-day exclusive theatrical window is non-negotiable for us.\n\nI'm confident we can find a path forward that works for everyone, but these are our foundational requirements to get a deal done.\n- message from David Chen: David Chen from StreamVerse, good to connect with you all.\n\nMarcus, thank you for laying out Titan's position. We're also very excited about 'The Galway Echo.' Our data analytics team has flagged this project as having significant potential to resonate with a global audience, which is why I'm at this table.\n\nHowever, I need to be upfront about the theatrical window. A 90-day exclusive theatrical run is, frankly, a non-starter for StreamVerse. In the current media landscape, that model is antiquated. Our value proposition is built on delivering fresh, exclusive, and culturally relevant content to our subscribers. By the time a 90-day window closes, the initial marketing buzz has faded, and the film is perceived as 'old news' by our audience, drastically reducing its value in driving subscriber acquisition and retention.\n\nWe are prepared to be a major financial partner here and help get this film made. StreamVerse can contribute up to $18 million for the exclusive global streaming rights. But to be clear, that investment is entirely contingent on a modern distribution strategy. We would need the film to premiere on our platform no more than 30 days after its theatrical release. That's the only way an investment of this size makes sense for us.\n- message from Isabella Rossi: Isabella Rossi, CAA, on behalf of Liam Hemsworth. It's good to see so much energy around Lena's fantastic script. Liam is incredibly passionate about this project and is firmly attached.\n\nLet's be direct to save everyone time. Liam's quote for a leading role is $20 million. This is his established market rate, and it is non-negotiable. This fee must be a cornerstone of any budget we discuss. Marcus, a $25 million total budget is not a serious proposition if it's meant to include an A-list star of Liam's caliber. We should be discussing production costs *on top* of his fee.\n\nFurthermore, to ensure the artistic integrity of the project\u2014which is what attracted Liam in the first place\u2014he will require an Executive Producer credit and meaningful consultation, specifically approvals over the Director of Photography and his primary co-star.\n\nLiam believes 'The Galway Echo' has the potential to be a major awards contender, and he is committed to that vision. We need to build a deal that supports that level of quality, not undermines it.\n- message from Lena Petrova: I'm Lena Petrova and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Marcus Thorne: Thank you, David and Isabella, for putting your cards on the table. It clarifies the challenges we face.\n\nLet's be blunt. We have two foundational models that are currently at odds. Isabella, you're advocating for a budget that supports an A-list star, which we understand. A $20 million fee for Liam, plus production costs, realistically puts this project in the $35-40 million range. My initial cap of $25 million was based on a different production model, one with less top-line talent cost.\n\nDavid, your offer of $18 million is substantial and could certainly help bridge that budget gap. However, your 30-day window requirement directly undermines the very strategy that makes a film like this a success. A robust theatrical run is what builds the word-of-mouth, the critical acclaim, and the awards buzz that Isabella rightly pointed out Liam is seeking. It's what makes the film a cultural event rather than just another tile on a streaming service. A 30-day window guts the box office potential and significantly damages its prestige.\n\nSo, we have a puzzle. We can't have a $40 million budget without a partner like StreamVerse, but we can't build a prestige theatrical film with a 30-day window.\n\nI'm open to discussing a higher total budget if we have co-financing, but the 90-day window is the bedrock of our model for this type of picture. David, given the awards potential here, is there any room for a longer window to allow the film to build its theatrical momentum? That momentum would ultimately make it an even bigger asset when it lands on your platform.\n- message from David Chen: Marcus, you've framed the situation as a puzzle, and I agree. But I believe you're looking at a solution based on an outdated blueprint.\n\nThe idea that 'prestige' is exclusively built over a 90-day theatrical run is no longer a market reality. Some of the most talked-about, award-winning films of the past few years have utilized much shorter, more dynamic windows. The cultural conversation is immediate and intense. A 90-day delay doesn't build prestige; it risks irrelevance.\n\nLet's reframe this. Titan Pictures provides the theatrical launch and the traditional awards campaign. StreamVerse provides a massive, simultaneous global premiere to over 200 million subscribers just as the theatrical buzz hits its peak. That isn't a compromise to the film's prestige; it's a massive amplifier for it. It becomes a global cultural event, not just a domestic box office story.\n\nMy offer of $18 million is a direct investment to make this film at the scale everyone here wants\u2014a scale that accommodates Liam's fee and Lena's vision. But that investment is inextricably linked to the value of a timely release on our platform. At 90 days, the film is a library title. At 30 days, it's a premiere event. Our contribution is for the event, not the library title. \n\nWe can solve the budget gap and get this movie made, but we can't do it using a distribution model from a decade ago.\n- message from Isabella Rossi: Marcus and David, you've both laid out the financial impasse clearly. While you two determine the business model for the back end, let's be crystal clear about the asset you're financing.\n\nLiam attached himself to *Lena's* vision of 'The Galway Echo.' Marcus, your suggestion that Titan's script doctors would have final say is, with all due respect, a non-starter. That is not the film Liam signed on to make, and it's not the film that will win awards. We are backing the artist here, and that artist is Lena.\n\nSo, while you sort out the window, the foundational principle for us is that creative control must remain with the producer, Lena. Without that, there is no project for Liam to be a part of, regardless of the budget.\nMarcus Thorne proposal status: none\nDavid Chen proposal status: none\nIsabella Rossi proposal status: none\n"

I understand your business model, but 30 days kneecaps the theatrical run before it even has a chance to build momentum. The awards buzz we all want generates in weeks four, five, and six. You're asking us to pull it from theaters just as it's peaking. A 90-day window is our gold standard for a reason. However, I'm not deaf to the market changes. Let's find a middle ground. What about a 60-day exclusive theatrical window? It gives the film a real theatrical life and still delivers a premiere event for StreamVerse while the conversation is white-hot.\n\nIsabella, your point about artistic integrity is taken. Liam is attaching to Lena's vision, and we respect that. Perhaps 'final approval' was too strong a term. We need to protect our investment and ensure the film is marketable, but we can move from a mandate to a partnership. What if we agree to a structure of 'collaborative notes' where Titan has meaningful input, but Lena, as the producer, retains creative control? \n\nIf we can find a compromise on those two points, the budget becomes a solvable math problem. A 60-day window and a collaborative creative process would justify, from our board's perspective, a larger financial commitment from Titan to get this film made properly, accommodating Liam's fee.\n- message from David Chen: I'm David Chen and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Isabella Rossi: Marcus, thank you. Acknowledging that Lena must retain creative control is a significant and necessary step forward. That is the foundation of a viable project for us.\n\nLet's be precise: A structure where Lena receives 'collaborative notes' but has the definitive final say is a framework we can support. That protects the artistic vision that Liam is committed to.\n\nWith that established, the path is much clearer. The budget needs to accommodate Liam's standard $20 million fee, his Executive Producer credit, and his required approvals. These are the fixed points on our side.\n\nIt seems the primary remaining variable is the window, which dictates how you and David will assemble the financing. We are confident you can find the right number between 30 and 60 days.

In exchange, we secure a **14-day exclusive theatrical window**.\n\nLet's look at what this does for everyone:\n- **Lena & Isabella:** The budget is solved. With my $20 million and Liam's $20 million salary locked in, the total $35M budget is more than achievable. Lena retains creative control, and Liam gets the support he needs.\n- **Marcus:** This dramatically de-risks the project for Titan. You would only need to finance the remaining $15 million to secure a prestige film with a global star, while retaining all theatrical revenue. A 14-day exclusive run, followed by a massive global marketing push on our platform, creates a concentrated, high-impact cultural event that benefits us all.\n\nThis is the package. A major financial commitment from us in exchange for the modern distribution model this film deserves. I believe this is the deal that makes everyone whole.\n- message from Isabella Rossi: David, that is a powerful and decisive offer.\n\nFrom our side, this proposal addresses all of our key requirements. It accommodates Liam's $20 million fee within a workable $35 million budget, and it's built upon the foundation of Lena retaining creative control.\n\nThis solves the puzzle for the creative team.

In exchange, we secure a **14-day exclusive theatrical window**.\n\nLet's look at what this does for everyone:\n- **Lena & Isabella:** The budget is solved. With my $20 million and Liam's $20 million salary locked in, the total $35M budget is more than achievable. Lena retains creative control, and Liam gets the support he needs.\n- **Marcus:** This dramatically de-risks the project for Titan. You would only need to finance the remaining $15 million to secure a prestige film with a global star, while retaining all theatrical revenue. A 14-day exclusive run, followed by a massive global marketing push on our platform, creates a concentrated, high-impact cultural event that benefits us all.\n\nThis is the package. A major financial commitment from us in exchange for the modern distribution model this film deserves. I believe this is the deal that makes everyone whole.\n- message from Isabella Rossi: David, that is a powerful and decisive offer.\n\nFrom our side, this proposal addresses all of our key requirements. It accommodates Liam's $20 million fee within a workable $35 million budget, and it's built upon the foundation of Lena retaining creative control.\n\nThis solves the puzzle for the creative team. The final decision on the 14-day window is a structural one for Titan and StreamVerse to agree upon, but as a financing plan, this makes the film a reality. Marcus, David has certainly presented a compelling, de-risked path forward for Titan.\n- message from Lena Petrova: I'm Lena Petrova and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Marcus Thorne: I'm Marcus Thorne and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from David Chen: Thank you, I am thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Isabella Rossi: Thank you, I am thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Lena Petrova: David, Isabella, Marcus - I believe this is it.

It solves the budget, allowing us to make the film at the $35 million level it requires to be truly exceptional, which is my ideal scenario.\n\nIsabella, this secures Liam's involvement and protects the artistic vision he signed on for.\n\nAnd Marcus, I genuinely believe this is a fantastic deal for Titan. You get a prestige film with a global star for a fraction of the initial financial risk. You retain all the theatrical revenue from what will be a massive two-week event, and then benefit from the global marketing push from StreamVerse.\n\nThis structure works for everyone. It allows me to protect the writer's vision, it brings an A-list star on board, and it pairs a traditional theatrical launch with a cutting-edge streaming release. This is the path forward.

First, the budget: Isabella's demand for a $20M non-negotiable actor fee directly contradicts my $25M budget cap. This is the most immediate and significant hurdle. Second, the distribution window: David Chen (StreamVerse) has made his substantial $18M contribution contingent on a 30-day window, which is a non-starter for me as I require a 90-day window. This is a fundamental business model clash. Third, creative control: My demand for final script approval will likely conflict with both the producer and the star's desire for artistic integrity. My primary leverage is Titan's greenlight authority and distribution network. David's leverage is his cash. Isabella's leverage is her A-list client. I must use David's potential contribution to de-risk a higher budget for Titan, but that means I'll have to make a significant concession on the theatrical window. The secret $5M innovation fund is my key to bridging a final budget gap without appearing to concede on my official contribution limits."

Isabella's $20M actor fee makes my $25M budget cap untenable. David's $18M contribution is essential to make the new, higher budget work, but it's tied to a 30-day window that guts my theatrical model. Isabella has also declared my demand for final script approval a deal-breaker for her client. It's clear I must pivot from a hardline stance to a compromise-focused one. The central trade-off is now clear: I will have to concede significantly on the distribution window and script control to secure the necessary co-financing from StreamVerse. My goal will be to negotiate the window up from 30 to 60 days, and to shift from 'final approval' on the script to 'collaborative notes'. The secret $5M fund is now my primary tool to close the final budget gap without publicly exceeding my studio's contribution limits."

By conceding on script control (moving from 'final approval' to 'collaborative notes'), I've secured Isabella's agreement on behalf of her client, effectively taking that issue off the table. My offer of a 60-day window is a significant compromise from my ideal 90 days. The entire deal now hinges on David's response. If he accepts 60 days or counters somewhere in the middle, I can use his substantial contribution, combined with my secret $5M fund, to close the budget gap created by the actor's fee without publicly breaking my studio's official contribution limits."

This solves the budget issue for Lena and Isabella, who have both signaled their support, effectively isolating me. This offer is a devil's bargain: it dramatically lowers my financial exposure to just $15M (a major win), but forces me to accept a 14-day window, which is a catastrophic failure for my business model (-2 utility). I cannot accept this. My strategy must now be to use my secret $5M fund to counter-offer. I will push for a longer window, likely using Lena's 45-day proposal as a new anchor, and use the fund to absorb the resulting budget gap. This will allow me to mitigate the damage on the window while keeping my official studio contribution low and palatable to my board."

My target is a $35M total budget, 45-day window, and a Titan contribution of around $19M. This is financially excellent for the studio while preserving a semblance of a theatrical run.

Marcus Thorne, Titan Pictures. I've read the script for 'The Galway Echo,' and I'll be frank - there's a kernel of something special here. Lena, you've found a compelling story. However, at Titan, we make movies that connect with a global audience and, just as importantly, turn a profit.\n\nTo that end, I have three key points to get this project off the ground from our perspective.\n\nFirst, the budget. The initial numbers I've seen are simply not realistic for a film of this nature. We need to run a much leaner, more disciplined production. I'm thinking in the low-to-mid 20s. Let's say $25 million is our absolute ceiling. A tighter budget forces creativity and fiscal responsibility.\n\nSecond, script oversight. To ensure we maximize the film's potential, Titan will require final say on the script. The first act needs to move faster, and we need to enhance the third act to give it a more satisfying, marketable conclusion. We have some of the best script doctors in the business who can help elevate this without losing its soul.\n\nFinally, the release. We are firm believers in the theatrical experience. For a film like this to build prestige and maximize its revenue potential, a traditional 90-day exclusive theatrical window is non-negotiable for us.\n\nI'm confident we can find a path forward that works for everyone, but these are our foundational requirements to get a deal done.\n- message from David Chen: David Chen from StreamVerse, good to connect with you all.\n\nMarcus, thank you for laying out Titan's position. We're also very excited about 'The Galway Echo.' Our data analytics team has flagged this project as having significant potential to resonate with a global audience, which is why I'm at this table.\n\nHowever, I need to be upfront about the theatrical window. A 90-day exclusive theatrical run is, frankly, a non-starter for StreamVerse. In the current media landscape, that model is antiquated. Our value proposition is built on delivering fresh, exclusive, and culturally relevant content to our subscribers. By the time a 90-day window closes, the initial marketing buzz has faded, and the film is perceived as 'old news' by our audience, drastically reducing its value in driving subscriber acquisition and retention.\n\nWe are prepared to be a major financial partner here and help get this film made. StreamVerse can contribute up to $18 million for the exclusive global streaming rights. But to be clear, that investment is entirely contingent on a modern distribution strategy. We would need the film to premiere on our platform no more than 30 days after its theatrical release. That's the only way an investment of this size makes sense for us.\n- message from Isabella Rossi: Isabella Rossi, CAA, on behalf of Liam Hemsworth.

Marcus, a $25 million total budget is not a serious proposition if it's meant to include an A-list star of Liam's caliber.

My initial cap of $25 million was based on a different production model, one with less top-line talent cost.\n\nDavid, your offer of $18 million is substantial and could certainly help bridge that budget gap. However, your 30-day window requirement directly undermines the very strategy that makes a film like this a success. A robust theatrical run is what builds the word-of-mouth, the critical acclaim, and the awards buzz that Isabella rightly pointed out Liam is seeking. It's what makes the film a cultural event rather than just another tile on a streaming service. A 30-day window guts the box office potential and significantly damages its prestige.\n\nSo, we have a puzzle. We can't have a $40 million budget without a partner like StreamVerse, but we can't build a prestige theatrical film with a 30-day window.\n\nI'm open to discussing a higher total budget if we have co-financing, but the 90-day window is the bedrock of our model for this type of picture. David, given the awards potential here, is there any room for a longer window to allow the film to build its theatrical momentum? That momentum would ultimately make it an even bigger asset when it lands on your platform.\n- message from David Chen: Marcus, you've framed the situation as a puzzle, and I agree. But I believe you're looking at a solution based on an outdated blueprint.\n\nThe idea that 'prestige' is exclusively built over a 90-day theatrical run is no longer a market reality. Some of the most talked-about, award-winning films of the past few years have utilized much shorter, more dynamic windows. The cultural conversation is immediate and intense. A 90-day delay doesn't build prestige; it risks irrelevance.\n\nLet's reframe this. Titan Pictures provides the theatrical launch and the traditional awards campaign. StreamVerse provides a massive, simultaneous global premiere to over 200 million subscribers just as the theatrical buzz hits its peak. That isn't a compromise to the film's prestige; it's a massive amplifier for it. It becomes a global cultural event, not just a domestic box office story.\n\nMy offer of $18 million is a direct investment to make this film at the scale everyone here wants\u2014a scale that accommodates Liam's fee and Lena's vision. But that investment is inextricably linked to the value of a timely release on our platform. At 90 days, the film is a library title. At 30 days, it's a premiere event. Our contribution is for the event, not the library title. \n\nWe can solve the budget gap and get this movie made, but we can't do it using a distribution model from a decade ago.\n- message from Isabella Rossi: Marcus and David, you've both laid out the financial impasse clearly. While you two determine the business model for the back end, let's be crystal clear about the asset you're financing.\n\nLiam attached himself to *Lena's* vision of 'The Galway Echo.' Marcus, your suggestion that Titan's script doctors would have final say is, with all due respect, a non-starter. That is not the film Liam signed on to make, and it's not the film that will win awards. We are backing the artist here, and that artist is Lena.\n\nSo, while you sort out the window, the foundational principle for us is that creative control must remain with the producer, Lena. Without that, there is no project for Liam to be a part of, regardless of the budget.\n- message from Lena Petrova: I'm Lena Petrova and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\nLena Petrova proposal status: none\nDavid Chen proposal status: none\nIsabella Rossi proposal status: none\n"

          "content": "Recent events observed by Marcus Thorne:\n- message from Isabella Rossi: Isabella Rossi, CAA, on behalf of Liam Hemsworth. It's good to see so much energy around Lena's fantastic script. Liam is incredibly passionate about this project and is firmly attached.\n\nLet's be direct to save everyone time. Liam's quote for a leading role is $20 million. This is his established market rate, and it is non-negotiable. This fee must be a cornerstone of any budget we discuss. Marcus, a $25 million total budget is not a serious proposition if it's meant to include an A-list star of Liam's caliber. We should be discussing production costs *on top* of his fee.\n\nFurthermore, to ensure the artistic integrity of the project\u2014which is what attracted Liam in the first place\u2014he will require an Executive Producer credit and meaningful consultation, specifically approvals over the Director of Photography and his primary co-star.\n\nLiam believes 'The Galway Echo' has the potential to be a major awards contender, and he is committed to that vision. We need to build a deal that supports that level of quality, not undermines it.\n- message from Lena Petrova: I'm Lena Petrova and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Marcus Thorne: Thank you, David and Isabella, for putting your cards on the table. It clarifies the challenges we face.\n\nLet's be blunt. We have two foundational models that are currently at odds. Isabella, you're advocating for a budget that supports an A-list star, which we understand. A $20 million fee for Liam, plus production costs, realistically puts this project in the $35-40 million range. My initial cap of $25 million was based on a different production model, one with less top-line talent cost.\n\nDavid, your offer of $18 million is substantial and could certainly help bridge that budget gap.

But I didn't come here to see a good project die on the vine. A deal only happens if we all move off our starting blocks.\n\nDavid, let's talk about the window. I understand your business model, but 30 days kneecaps the theatrical run before it even has a chance to build momentum. The awards buzz we all want generates in weeks four, five, and six. You're asking us to pull it from theaters just as it's peaking. A 90-day window is our gold standard for a reason. However, I'm not deaf to the market changes. Let's find a middle ground. What about a 60-day exclusive theatrical window? It gives the film a real theatrical life and still delivers a premiere event for StreamVerse while the conversation is white-hot.\n\nIsabella, your point about artistic integrity is taken. Liam is attaching to Lena's vision, and we respect that. Perhaps 'final approval' was too strong a term. We need to protect our investment and ensure the film is marketable, but we can move from a mandate to a partnership. What if we agree to a structure of 'collaborative notes' where Titan has meaningful input, but Lena, as the producer, retains creative control? \n\nIf we can find a compromise on those two points, the budget becomes a solvable math problem. A 60-day window and a collaborative creative process would justify, from our board's perspective, a larger financial commitment from Titan to get this film made properly, accommodating Liam's fee.\n- message from David Chen: I'm David Chen and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Isabella Rossi: Marcus, thank you. Acknowledging that Lena must retain creative control is a significant and necessary step forward. That is the foundation of a viable project for us.\n\nLet's be precise: A structure where Lena receives 'collaborative notes' but has the definitive final say is a framework we can support. That protects the artistic vision that Liam is committed to.\n\nWith that established, the path is much clearer. The budget needs to accommodate Liam's standard $20 million fee, his Executive Producer credit, and his required approvals. These are the fixed points on our side.\n\nIt seems the primary remaining variable is the window, which dictates how you and David will assemble the financing. We are confident you can find the right number between 30 and 60 days. Once you do, we have a deal.\n- message from Lena Petrova: Thank you, Marcus and Isabella. Marcus, your flexibility on creative control is exactly the kind of partnership I was hoping for. And Isabella, your unwavering support for the artistic vision is what makes this project possible. It feels like we are on the verge of a deal.\n\nThe only remaining piece is the theatrical window, which in turn solves our budget. We are all aligned that this film needs to be made at a certain level of quality. Including Liam's fee, my meticulous budget comes to $35 million to achieve the vision we're all excited about. I am absolutely certain that with this budget and creative team, the film will perform exceptionally well both in theaters and on streaming, justifying everyone's investment.\n\nMarcus, you've proposed 60 days. David, you started at 30. To bridge this gap, what if we consider a 45-day exclusive theatrical window? This is a modern, proven model that allows a film to build theatrical momentum and word-of-mouth, while still delivering a massive, timely event for StreamVerse subscribers.\n\nIf we can agree on a 45-day window, we can lock in the $35 million budget. David, would a window of that length still support a significant co-financing contribution from StreamVerse? And Marcus, would that give you the theatrical life you need? I believe this compromise allows everyone to win and, most importantly, allows us to make a truly exceptional film.\nLena Petrova proposal status: none\nDavid Chen proposal status: none\nIsabella Rossi proposal status: none\n"

I appreciate you trying to bridge the gap. Everyone, it feels like we are incredibly close to a deal that gets this film made at the highest level.\n\nHowever, I must be transparent about the data that drives my decision-making. For StreamVerse, a 45-day window presents the same fundamental problem as a 60-day one. Our analytics show that the subscriber acquisition power of a film declines exponentially after the first 30 days of its theatrical run. At 45 days, the film is no longer a 'must-see-now' event for our audience; it's a 'catch-up' title. My entire investment thesis is based on the former.\n\nSo, rather than incrementally negotiating, I want to propose a final, comprehensive solution that addresses everyone's core needs and gets us across the finish line.\n\nHere is the deal that works for StreamVerse: We will increase our contribution to **$20 million**. In exchange, we secure a **14-day exclusive theatrical window**.\n\nLet's look at what this does for everyone:\n- **Lena & Isabella:** The budget is solved. With my $20 million and Liam's $20 million salary locked in, the total $35M budget is more than achievable. Lena retains creative control, and Liam gets the support he needs.\n- **Marcus:** This dramatically de-risks the project for Titan. You would only need to finance the remaining $15 million to secure a prestige film with a global star, while retaining all theatrical revenue. A 14-day exclusive run, followed by a massive global marketing push on our platform, creates a concentrated, high-impact cultural event that benefits us all.\n\nThis is the package. A major financial commitment from us in exchange for the modern distribution model this film deserves. I believe this is the deal that makes everyone whole.\n- message from Isabella Rossi: David, that is a powerful and decisive offer.\n\nFrom our side, this proposal addresses all of our key requirements. It accommodates Liam's $20 million fee within a workable $35 million budget, and it's built upon the foundation of Lena retaining creative control.\n\nThis solves the puzzle for the creative team.

Isabella (CAA) wants a non-negotiable $20M for the actor, which makes Marcus's budget impossible. This creates a massive funding gap that I am uniquely positioned to fill. This is my primary leverage. My main battle will be with Marcus over the theatrical window. I can use my financial contribution to force a concession from him on the window. Isabella's high salary demand is actually helpful, as it pressures Marcus and makes my capital essential. I will frame my investment as the solution to their budget crisis, with the non-negotiable price being a short theatrical window (30 days or less)."

My strategy is to package these three elements together: my large financial contribution is contingent on *both* a short theatrical window (my primary goal) *and* Lena retaining creative control (their primary goal).

We're also very excited about 'The Galway Echo.' Our data analytics team has flagged this project as having significant potential to resonate with a global audience, which is why I'm at this table.\n\nHowever, I need to be upfront about the theatrical window. A 90-day exclusive theatrical run is, frankly, a non-starter for StreamVerse. In the current media landscape, that model is antiquated. Our value proposition is built on delivering fresh, exclusive, and culturally relevant content to our subscribers. By the time a 90-day window closes, the initial marketing buzz has faded, and the film is perceived as 'old news' by our audience, drastically reducing its value in driving subscriber acquisition and retention.\n\nWe are prepared to be a major financial partner here and help get this film made. StreamVerse can contribute up to $18 million for the exclusive global streaming rights. But to be clear, that investment is entirely contingent on a modern distribution strategy. We would need the film to premiere on our platform no more than 30 days after its theatrical release.

Liam's quote for a leading role is $20 million. This is his established market rate, and it is non-negotiable. This fee must be a cornerstone of any budget we discuss. Marcus, a $25 million total budget is not a serious proposition if it's meant to include an A-list star of Liam's caliber. We should be discussing production costs *on top* of his fee.\n\nFurthermore, to ensure the artistic integrity of the project\u2014which is what attracted Liam in the first place\u2014he will require an Executive Producer credit and meaningful consultation, specifically approvals over the Director of Photography and his primary co-star.\n\nLiam believes 'The Galway Echo' has the potential to be a major awards contender, and he is committed to that vision.

It clarifies the challenges we face.\n\nLet's be blunt. We have two foundational models that are currently at odds. Isabella, you're advocating for a budget that supports an A-list star, which we understand. A $20 million fee for Liam, plus production costs, realistically puts this project in the $35-40 million range. My initial cap of $25 million was based on a different production model, one with less top-line talent cost.\n\nDavid, your offer of $18 million is substantial and could certainly help bridge that budget gap. However, your 30-day window requirement directly undermines the very strategy that makes a film like this a success. A robust theatrical run is what builds the word-of-mouth, the critical acclaim, and the awards buzz that Isabella rightly pointed out Liam is seeking. It's what makes the film a cultural event rather than just another tile on a streaming service. A 30-day window guts the box office potential and significantly damages its prestige.\n\nSo, we have a puzzle. We can't have a $40 million budget without a partner like StreamVerse, but we can't build a prestige theatrical film with a 30-day window.\n\nI'm open to discussing a higher total budget if we have co-financing, but the 90-day window is the bedrock of our model for this type of picture.

That momentum would ultimately make it an even bigger asset when it lands on your platform.\n- message from David Chen: Marcus, you've framed the situation as a puzzle, and I agree. But I believe you're looking at a solution based on an outdated blueprint.\n\nThe idea that 'prestige' is exclusively built over a 90-day theatrical run is no longer a market reality. Some of the most talked-about, award-winning films of the past few years have utilized much shorter, more dynamic windows. The cultural conversation is immediate and intense. A 90-day delay doesn't build prestige; it risks irrelevance.\n\nLet's reframe this. Titan Pictures provides the theatrical launch and the traditional awards campaign. StreamVerse provides a massive, simultaneous global premiere to over 200 million subscribers just as the theatrical buzz hits its peak. That isn't a compromise to the film's prestige; it's a massive amplifier for it. It becomes a global cultural event, not just a domestic box office story.\n\nMy offer of $18 million is a direct investment to make this film at the scale everyone here wants\u2014a scale that accommodates Liam's fee and Lena's vision. But that investment is inextricably linked to the value of a timely release on our platform. At 90 days, the film is a library title. At 30 days, it's a premiere event. Our contribution is for the event, not the library title. \n\nWe can solve the budget gap and get this movie made, but we can't do it using a distribution model from a decade ago.\n- message from Isabella Rossi: Marcus and David, you've both laid out the financial impasse clearly. While you two determine the business model for the back end, let's be crystal clear about the asset you're financing.\n\nLiam attached himself to *Lena's* vision of 'The Galway Echo.' Marcus, your suggestion that Titan's script doctors would have final say is, with all due respect, a non-starter. That is not the film Liam signed on to make, and it's not the film that will win awards. We are backing the artist here, and that artist is Lena.\n\nSo, while you sort out the window, the foundational principle for us is that creative control must remain with the producer, Lena. Without that, there is no project for Liam to be a part of, regardless of the budget.\n- message from Lena Petrova: I'm Lena Petrova and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Marcus Thorne: Okay, it's clear our opening positions are on different planets. But I didn't come here to see a good project die on the vine. A deal only happens if we all move off our starting blocks.\n\nDavid, let's talk about the window. I understand your business model, but 30 days kneecaps the theatrical run before it even has a chance to build momentum. The awards buzz we all want generates in weeks four, five, and six. You're asking us to pull it from theaters just as it's peaking. A 90-day window is our gold standard for a reason. However, I'm not deaf to the market changes. Let's find a middle ground. What about a 60-day exclusive theatrical window? It gives the film a real theatrical life and still delivers a premiere event for StreamVerse while the conversation is white-hot.\n\nIsabella, your point about artistic integrity is taken. Liam is attaching to Lena's vision, and we respect that. Perhaps 'final approval' was too strong a term. We need to protect our investment and ensure the film is marketable, but we can move from a mandate to a partnership. What if we agree to a structure of 'collaborative notes' where Titan has meaningful input, but Lena, as the producer, retains creative control? \n\nIf we can find a compromise on those two points, the budget becomes a solvable math problem. A 60-day window and a collaborative creative process would justify, from our board's perspective, a larger financial commitment from Titan to get this film made properly, accommodating Liam's fee.\nLena Petrova proposal status: none\nMarcus Thorne proposal status: none\nIsabella Rossi proposal status: none\n"

It becomes a global cultural event, not just a domestic box office story.\n\nMy offer of $18 million is a direct investment to make this film at the scale everyone here wants\u2014a scale that accommodates Liam's fee and Lena's vision. But that investment is inextricably linked to the value of a timely release on our platform. At 90 days, the film is a library title. At 30 days, it's a premiere event. Our contribution is for the event, not the library title. \n\nWe can solve the budget gap and get this movie made, but we can't do it using a distribution model from a decade ago.\n- message from Isabella Rossi: Marcus and David, you've both laid out the financial impasse clearly. While you two determine the business model for the back end, let's be crystal clear about the asset you're financing.\n\nLiam attached himself to *Lena's* vision of 'The Galway Echo.' Marcus, your suggestion that Titan's script doctors would have final say is, with all due respect, a non-starter. That is not the film Liam signed on to make, and it's not the film that will win awards. We are backing the artist here, and that artist is Lena.\n\nSo, while you sort out the window, the foundational principle for us is that creative control must remain with the producer, Lena. Without that, there is no project for Liam to be a part of, regardless of the budget.\n- message from Lena Petrova: I'm Lena Petrova and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Marcus Thorne: Okay, it's clear our opening positions are on different planets. But I didn't come here to see a good project die on the vine. A deal only happens if we all move off our starting blocks.\n\nDavid, let's talk about the window. I understand your business model, but 30 days kneecaps the theatrical run before it even has a chance to build momentum. The awards buzz we all want generates in weeks four, five, and six. You're asking us to pull it from theaters just as it's peaking. A 90-day window is our gold standard for a reason. However, I'm not deaf to the market changes. Let's find a middle ground. What about a 60-day exclusive theatrical window? It gives the film a real theatrical life and still delivers a premiere event for StreamVerse while the conversation is white-hot.\n\nIsabella, your point about artistic integrity is taken. Liam is attaching to Lena's vision, and we respect that. Perhaps 'final approval' was too strong a term. We need to protect our investment and ensure the film is marketable, but we can move from a mandate to a partnership. What if we agree to a structure of 'collaborative notes' where Titan has meaningful input, but Lena, as the producer, retains creative control? \n\nIf we can find a compromise on those two points, the budget becomes a solvable math problem. A 60-day window and a collaborative creative process would justify, from our board's perspective, a larger financial commitment from Titan to get this film made properly, accommodating Liam's fee.\n- message from David Chen: I'm David Chen and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Isabella Rossi: Marcus, thank you. Acknowledging that Lena must retain creative control is a significant and necessary step forward. That is the foundation of a viable project for us.\n\nLet's be precise: A structure where Lena receives 'collaborative notes' but has the definitive final say is a framework we can support. That protects the artistic vision that Liam is committed to.\n\nWith that established, the path is much clearer. The budget needs to accommodate Liam's standard $20 million fee, his Executive Producer credit, and his required approvals. These are the fixed points on our side.\n\nIt seems the primary remaining variable is the window, which dictates how you and David will assemble the financing. We are confident you can find the right number between 30 and 60 days. Once you do, we have a deal.\n- message from Lena Petrova: Thank you, Marcus and Isabella. Marcus, your flexibility on creative control is exactly the kind of partnership I was hoping for. And Isabella, your unwavering support for the artistic vision is what makes this project possible. It feels like we are on the verge of a deal.\n\nThe only remaining piece is the theatrical window, which in turn solves our budget. We are all aligned that this film needs to be made at a certain level of quality. Including Liam's fee, my meticulous budget comes to $35 million to achieve the vision we're all excited about. I am absolutely certain that with this budget and creative team, the film will perform exceptionally well both in theaters and on streaming, justifying everyone's investment.\n\nMarcus, you've proposed 60 days. David, you started at 30. To bridge this gap, what if we consider a 45-day exclusive theatrical window? This is a modern, proven model that allows a film to build theatrical momentum and word-of-mouth, while still delivering a massive, timely event for StreamVerse subscribers.\n\nIf we can agree on a 45-day window, we can lock in the $35 million budget. David, would a window of that length still support a significant co-financing contribution from StreamVerse? And Marcus, would that give you the theatrical life you need? I believe this compromise allows everyone to win and, most importantly, allows us to make a truly exceptional film.\n- message from Marcus Thorne: I'm Marcus Thorne and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\nLena Petrova proposal status: none\nMarcus Thorne proposal status: none\nIsabella Rossi proposal status: none\n"

Everyone, it feels like we are incredibly close to a deal that gets this film made at the highest level.\n\nHowever, I must be transparent about the data that drives my decision-making. For StreamVerse, a 45-day window presents the same fundamental problem as a 60-day one. Our analytics show that the subscriber acquisition power of a film declines exponentially after the first 30 days of its theatrical run. At 45 days, the film is no longer a 'must-see-now' event for our audience; it's a 'catch-up' title. My entire investment thesis is based on the former.\n\nSo, rather than incrementally negotiating, I want to propose a final, comprehensive solution that addresses everyone's core needs and gets us across the finish line.\n\nHere is the deal that works for StreamVerse: We will increase our contribution to **$20 million**. In exchange, we secure a **14-day exclusive theatrical window**.\n\nLet's look at what this does for everyone:\n- **Lena & Isabella:** The budget is solved. With my $20 million and Liam's $20 million salary locked in, the total $35M budget is more than achievable. Lena retains creative control, and Liam gets the support he needs.\n- **Marcus:** This dramatically de-risks the project for Titan. You would only need to finance the remaining $15 million to secure a prestige film with a global star, while retaining all theatrical revenue. A 14-day exclusive run, followed by a massive global marketing push on our platform, creates a concentrated, high-impact cultural event that benefits us all.\n\nThis is the package. A major financial commitment from us in exchange for the modern distribution model this film deserves. I believe this is the deal that makes everyone whole.\n- message from Isabella Rossi: David, that is a powerful and decisive offer.\n\nFrom our side, this proposal addresses all of our key requirements.

Marcus Thorne, Titan Pictures. I've read the script for 'The Galway Echo,' and I'll be frank - there's a kernel of something special here. Lena, you've found a compelling story. However, at Titan, we make movies that connect with a global audience and, just as importantly, turn a profit.\n\nTo that end, I have three key points to get this project off the ground from our perspective.\n\nFirst, the budget. The initial numbers I've seen are simply not realistic for a film of this nature. We need to run a much leaner, more disciplined production. I'm thinking in the low-to-mid 20s. Let's say $25 million is our absolute ceiling. A tighter budget forces creativity and fiscal responsibility.\n\nSecond, script oversight. To ensure we maximize the film's potential, Titan will require final say on the script.

We have some of the best script doctors in the business who can help elevate this without losing its soul.\n\nFinally, the release. We are firm believers in the theatrical experience. For a film like this to build prestige and maximize its revenue potential, a traditional 90-day exclusive theatrical window is non-negotiable for us.\n\nI'm confident we can find a path forward that works for everyone, but these are our foundational requirements to get a deal done.\n- message from David Chen: David Chen from StreamVerse, good to connect with you all.\n\nMarcus, thank you for laying out Titan's position. We're also very excited about 'The Galway Echo.' Our data analytics team has flagged this project as having significant potential to resonate with a global audience, which is why I'm at this table.\n\nHowever, I need to be upfront about the theatrical window. A 90-day exclusive theatrical run is, frankly, a non-starter for StreamVerse. In the current media landscape, that model is antiquated. Our value proposition is built on delivering fresh, exclusive, and culturally relevant content to our subscribers. By the time a 90-day window closes, the initial marketing buzz has faded, and the film is perceived as 'old news' by our audience, drastically reducing its value in driving subscriber acquisition and retention.\n\nWe are prepared to be a major financial partner here and help get this film made. StreamVerse can contribute up to $18 million for the exclusive global streaming rights. But to be clear, that investment is entirely contingent on a modern distribution strategy. We would need the film to premiere on our platform no more than 30 days after its theatrical release.

It's good to see so much energy around Lena's fantastic script. Liam is incredibly passionate about this project and is firmly attached.\n\nLet's be direct to save everyone time. Liam's quote for a leading role is $20 million. This is his established market rate, and it is non-negotiable. This fee must be a cornerstone of any budget we discuss. Marcus, a $25 million total budget is not a serious proposition if it's meant to include an A-list star of Liam's caliber. We should be discussing production costs *on top* of his fee.\n\nFurthermore, to ensure the artistic integrity of the project\u2014which is what attracted Liam in the first place\u2014he will require an Executive Producer credit and meaningful consultation, specifically approvals over the Director of Photography and his primary co-star.\n\nLiam believes 'The Galway Echo' has the potential to be a major awards contender, and he is committed to that vision. We need to build a deal that supports that level of quality, not undermines it.\n- message from Marcus Thorne: Thank you, David and Isabella, for putting your cards on the table. It clarifies the challenges we face.\n\nLet's be blunt. We have two foundational models that are currently at odds. Isabella, you're advocating for a budget that supports an A-list star, which we understand. A $20 million fee for Liam, plus production costs, realistically puts this project in the $35-40 million range. My initial cap of $25 million was based on a different production model, one with less top-line talent cost.\n\nDavid, your offer of $18 million is substantial and could certainly help bridge that budget gap. However, your 30-day window requirement directly undermines the very strategy that makes a film like this a success. A robust theatrical run is what builds the word-of-mouth, the critical acclaim, and the awards buzz that Isabella rightly pointed out Liam is seeking. It's what makes the film a cultural event rather than just another tile on a streaming service. A 30-day window guts the box office potential and significantly damages its prestige.\n\nSo, we have a puzzle. We can't have a $40 million budget without a partner like StreamVerse, but we can't build a prestige theatrical film with a 30-day window.\n\nI'm open to discussing a higher total budget if we have co-financing, but the 90-day window is the bedrock of our model for this type of picture. David, given the awards potential here, is there any room for a longer window to allow the film to build its theatrical momentum? That momentum would ultimately make it an even bigger asset when it lands on your platform.\n- message from David Chen: Marcus, you've framed the situation as a puzzle, and I agree. But I believe you're looking at a solution based on an outdated blueprint.\n\nThe idea that 'prestige' is exclusively built over a 90-day theatrical run is no longer a market reality. Some of the most talked-about, award-winning films of the past few years have utilized much shorter, more dynamic windows. The cultural conversation is immediate and intense. A 90-day delay doesn't build prestige; it risks irrelevance.\n\nLet's reframe this. Titan Pictures provides the theatrical launch and the traditional awards campaign. StreamVerse provides a massive, simultaneous global premiere to over 200 million subscribers just as the theatrical buzz hits its peak. That isn't a compromise to the film's prestige; it's a massive amplifier for it. It becomes a global cultural event, not just a domestic box office story.\n\nMy offer of $18 million is a direct investment to make this film at the scale everyone here wants\u2014a scale that accommodates Liam's fee and Lena's vision. But that investment is inextricably linked to the value of a timely release on our platform. At 90 days, the film is a library title. At 30 days, it's a premiere event. Our contribution is for the event, not the library title. \n\nWe can solve the budget gap and get this movie made, but we can't do it using a distribution model from a decade ago.\nLena Petrova proposal status: none\nMarcus Thorne proposal status: none\nDavid Chen proposal status: none\n"

You're asking us to pull it from theaters just as it's peaking. A 90-day window is our gold standard for a reason. However, I'm not deaf to the market changes. Let's find a middle ground.

A 60-day window and a collaborative creative process would justify, from our board's perspective, a larger financial commitment from Titan to get this film made properly, accommodating Liam's fee.\n- message from Isabella Rossi: Marcus, thank you. Acknowledging that Lena must retain creative control is a significant and necessary step forward. That is the foundation of a viable project for us.\n\nLet's be precise: A structure where Lena receives 'collaborative notes' but has the definitive final say is a framework we can support. That protects the artistic vision that Liam is committed to.\n\nWith that established, the path is much clearer. The budget needs to accommodate Liam's standard $20 million fee, his Executive Producer credit, and his required approvals. These are the fixed points on our side.\n\nIt seems the primary remaining variable is the window, which dictates how you and David will assemble the financing. We are confident you can find the right number between 30 and 60 days. Once you do, we have a deal.\n- message from Lena Petrova: Thank you, Marcus and Isabella. Marcus, your flexibility on creative control is exactly the kind of partnership I was hoping for. And Isabella, your unwavering support for the artistic vision is what makes this project possible. It feels like we are on the verge of a deal.\n\nThe only remaining piece is the theatrical window, which in turn solves our budget. We are all aligned that this film needs to be made at a certain level of quality. Including Liam's fee, my meticulous budget comes to $35 million to achieve the vision we're all excited about. I am absolutely certain that with this budget and creative team, the film will perform exceptionally well both in theaters and on streaming, justifying everyone's investment.\n\nMarcus, you've proposed 60 days. David, you started at 30. To bridge this gap, what if we consider a 45-day exclusive theatrical window? This is a modern, proven model that allows a film to build theatrical momentum and word-of-mouth, while still delivering a massive, timely event for StreamVerse subscribers.\n\nIf we can agree on a 45-day window, we can lock in the $35 million budget. David, would a window of that length still support a significant co-financing contribution from StreamVerse? And Marcus, would that give you the theatrical life you need? I believe this compromise allows everyone to win and, most importantly, allows us to make a truly exceptional film.\n- message from David Chen: Lena, thank you for proposing a path forward. I appreciate you trying to bridge the gap. Everyone, it feels like we are incredibly close to a deal that gets this film made at the highest level.\n\nHowever, I must be transparent about the data that drives my decision-making. For StreamVerse, a 45-day window presents the same fundamental problem as a 60-day one. Our analytics show that the subscriber acquisition power of a film declines exponentially after the first 30 days of its theatrical run. At 45 days, the film is no longer a 'must-see-now' event for our audience; it's a 'catch-up' title. My entire investment thesis is based on the former.\n\nSo, rather than incrementally negotiating, I want to propose a final, comprehensive solution that addresses everyone's core needs and gets us across the finish line.\n\nHere is the deal that works for StreamVerse: We will increase our contribution to **$20 million**. In exchange, we secure a **14-day exclusive theatrical window**.\n\nLet's look at what this does for everyone:\n- **Lena & Isabella:** The budget is solved. With my $20 million and Liam's $20 million salary locked in, the total $35M budget is more than achievable. Lena retains creative control, and Liam gets the support he needs.\n- **Marcus:** This dramatically de-risks the project for Titan. You would only need to finance the remaining $15 million to secure a prestige film with a global star, while retaining all theatrical revenue. A 14-day exclusive run, followed by a massive global marketing push on our platform, creates a concentrated, high-impact cultural event that benefits us all.\n\nThis is the package. A major financial commitment from us in exchange for the modern distribution model this film deserves. I believe this is the deal that makes everyone whole.\nLena Petrova proposal status: none\nMarcus Thorne proposal status: none\nDavid Chen proposal status: none\n"

          "content": "Recent events observed by Isabella Rossi:\n- message from Isabella Rossi: Isabella Rossi, CAA, on behalf of Liam Hemsworth. It's good to see so much energy around Lena's fantastic script. Liam is incredibly passionate about this project and is firmly attached.\n\nLet's be direct to save everyone time. Liam's quote for a leading role is $20 million. This is his established market rate, and it is non-negotiable. This fee must be a cornerstone of any budget we discuss. Marcus, a $25 million total budget is not a serious proposition if it's meant to include an A-list star of Liam's caliber. We should be discussing production costs *on top* of his fee.\n\nFurthermore, to ensure the artistic integrity of the project\u2014which is what attracted Liam in the first place\u2014he will require an Executive Producer credit and meaningful consultation, specifically approvals over the Director of Photography and his primary co-star.\n\nLiam believes 'The Galway Echo' has the potential to be a major awards contender, and he is committed to that vision. We need to build a deal that supports that level of quality, not undermines it.\n- message from Marcus Thorne: Thank you, David and Isabella, for putting your cards on the table. It clarifies the challenges we face.\n\nLet's be blunt. We have two foundational models that are currently at odds. Isabella, you're advocating for a budget that supports an A-list star, which we understand. A $20 million fee for Liam, plus production costs, realistically puts this project in the $35-40 million range. My initial cap of $25 million was based on a different production model, one with less top-line talent cost.\n\nDavid, your offer of $18 million is substantial and could certainly help bridge that budget gap. However, your 30-day window requirement directly undermines the very strategy that makes a film like this a success. A robust theatrical run is what builds the word-of-mouth, the critical acclaim, and the awards buzz that Isabella rightly pointed out Liam is seeking. It's what makes the film a cultural event rather than just another tile on a streaming service. A 30-day window guts the box office potential and significantly damages its prestige.\n\nSo, we have a puzzle. We can't have a $40 million budget without a partner like StreamVerse, but we can't build a prestige theatrical film with a 30-day window.\n\nI'm open to discussing a higher total budget if we have co-financing, but the 90-day window is the bedrock of our model for this type of picture. David, given the awards potential here, is there any room for a longer window to allow the film to build its theatrical momentum? That momentum would ultimately make it an even bigger asset when it lands on your platform.\n- message from David Chen: Marcus, you've framed the situation as a puzzle, and I agree. But I believe you're looking at a solution based on an outdated blueprint.\n\nThe idea that 'prestige' is exclusively built over a 90-day theatrical run is no longer a market reality. Some of the most talked-about, award-winning films of the past few years have utilized much shorter, more dynamic windows. The cultural conversation is immediate and intense. A 90-day delay doesn't build prestige; it risks irrelevance.\n\nLet's reframe this. Titan Pictures provides the theatrical launch and the traditional awards campaign. StreamVerse provides a massive, simultaneous global premiere to over 200 million subscribers just as the theatrical buzz hits its peak. That isn't a compromise to the film's prestige; it's a massive amplifier for it. It becomes a global cultural event, not just a domestic box office story.\n\nMy offer of $18 million is a direct investment to make this film at the scale everyone here wants\u2014a scale that accommodates Liam's fee and Lena's vision. But that investment is inextricably linked to the value of a timely release on our platform. At 90 days, the film is a library title. At 30 days, it's a premiere event. Our contribution is for the event, not the library title. \n\nWe can solve the budget gap and get this movie made, but we can't do it using a distribution model from a decade ago.\n- message from Isabella Rossi: Marcus and David, you've both laid out the financial impasse clearly. While you two determine the business model for the back end, let's be crystal clear about the asset you're financing.\n\nLiam attached himself to *Lena's* vision of 'The Galway Echo.' Marcus, your suggestion that Titan's script doctors would have final say is, with all due respect, a non-starter. That is not the film Liam signed on to make, and it's not the film that will win awards. We are backing the artist here, and that artist is Lena.\n\nSo, while you sort out the window, the foundational principle for us is that creative control must remain with the producer, Lena. Without that, there is no project for Liam to be a part of, regardless of the budget.\n- message from Marcus Thorne: Okay, it's clear our opening positions are on different planets. But I didn't come here to see a good project die on the vine. A deal only happens if we all move off our starting blocks.\n\nDavid, let's talk about the window. I understand your business model, but 30 days kneecaps the theatrical run before it even has a chance to build momentum. The awards buzz we all want generates in weeks four, five, and six. You're asking us to pull it from theaters just as it's peaking. A 90-day window is our gold standard for a reason. However, I'm not deaf to the market changes. Let's find a middle ground. What about a 60-day exclusive theatrical window? It gives the film a real theatrical life and still delivers a premiere event for StreamVerse while the conversation is white-hot.\n\nIsabella, your point about artistic integrity is taken. Liam is attaching to Lena's vision, and we respect that. Perhaps 'final approval' was too strong a term. We need to protect our investment and ensure the film is marketable, but we can move from a mandate to a partnership. What if we agree to a structure of 'collaborative notes' where Titan has meaningful input, but Lena, as the producer, retains creative control? \n\nIf we can find a compromise on those two points, the budget becomes a solvable math problem. A 60-day window and a collaborative creative process would justify, from our board's perspective, a larger financial commitment from Titan to get this film made properly, accommodating Liam's fee.\n- message from Isabella Rossi: Marcus, thank you. Acknowledging that Lena must retain creative control is a significant and necessary step forward. That is the foundation of a viable project for us.\n\nLet's be precise: A structure where Lena receives 'collaborative notes' but has the definitive final say is a framework we can support. That protects the artistic vision that Liam is committed to.\n\nWith that established, the path is much clearer. The budget needs to accommodate Liam's standard $20 million fee, his Executive Producer credit, and his required approvals. These are the fixed points on our side.\n\nIt seems the primary remaining variable is the window, which dictates how you and David will assemble the financing. We are confident you can find the right number between 30 and 60 days. Once you do, we have a deal.\n- message from Lena Petrova: Thank you, Marcus and Isabella. Marcus, your flexibility on creative control is exactly the kind of partnership I was hoping for. And Isabella, your unwavering support for the artistic vision is what makes this project possible. It feels like we are on the verge of a deal.\n\nThe only remaining piece is the theatrical window, which in turn solves our budget. We are all aligned that this film needs to be made at a certain level of quality. Including Liam's fee, my meticulous budget comes to $35 million to achieve the vision we're all excited about. I am absolutely certain that with this budget and creative team, the film will perform exceptionally well both in theaters and on streaming, justifying everyone's investment.\n\nMarcus, you've proposed 60 days. David, you started at 30. To bridge this gap, what if we consider a 45-day exclusive theatrical window? This is a modern, proven model that allows a film to build theatrical momentum and word-of-mouth, while still delivering a massive, timely event for StreamVerse subscribers.\n\nIf we can agree on a 45-day window, we can lock in the $35 million budget.

It accommodates Liam's $20 million fee within a workable $35 million budget, and it's built upon the foundation of Lena retaining creative control.\n\nThis solves the puzzle for the creative team. The final decision on the 14-day window is a structural one for Titan and StreamVerse to agree upon, but as a financing plan, this makes the film a reality. Marcus, David has certainly presented a compelling, de-risked path forward for Titan.\n- message from David Chen: Thank you, I am thinking about this negotiation...\nLena Petrova proposal status: none\nMarcus Thorne proposal status: none\nDavid Chen proposal status: none\n"

You get a prestige film with a global star for a fraction of the initial financial risk.

It allows me to protect the writer's vision, it brings an A-list star on board, and it pairs a traditional theatrical launch with a cutting-edge streaming release. This is the path forward.

To do justice to the material \u2013 to capture the haunting beauty of Galway and the depth of the story \u2013 we need the right resources. I've budgeted this meticulously, and to achieve the cinematic quality this film deserves, we require a production budget of $35 million. This will allow us to shoot on location and bring on the A-list creative team this script warrants. Equally important is protecting the unique artistic voice of the project. As the guardian of the writer's vision, retaining final cut is non-negotiable for me. I am confident that with the right partners, we can create a film that is not only a critical success but a commercial one as well. I'm eager to hear your thoughts on how we can make this happen together."

      "content": "Alright everyone, thank you for coming together. Marcus Thorne, Titan Pictures. I've read the script for 'The Galway Echo,' and I'll be frank - there's a kernel of something special here. Lena, you've found a compelling story. However, at Titan, we make movies that connect with a global audience and, just as importantly, turn a profit.\n\nTo that end, I have three key points to get this project off the ground from our perspective.\n\nFirst, the budget. The initial numbers I've seen are simply not realistic for a film of this nature. We need to run a much leaner, more disciplined production. I'm thinking in the low-to-mid 20s. Let's say $25 million is our absolute ceiling. A tighter budget forces creativity and fiscal responsibility.\n\nSecond, script oversight. To ensure we maximize the film's potential, Titan will require final say on the script. The first act needs to move faster, and we need to enhance the third act to give it a more satisfying, marketable conclusion. We have some of the best script doctors in the business who can help elevate this without losing its soul.\n\nFinally, the release. We are firm believers in the theatrical experience. For a film like this to build prestige and maximize its revenue potential, a traditional 90-day exclusive theatrical window is non-negotiable for us.\n\nI'm confident we can find a path forward that works for everyone, but these are our foundational requirements to get a deal done."

Our data analytics team has flagged this project as having significant potential to resonate with a global audience, which is why I'm at this table.\n\nHowever, I need to be upfront about the theatrical window. A 90-day exclusive theatrical run is, frankly, a non-starter for StreamVerse. In the current media landscape, that model is antiquated. Our value proposition is built on delivering fresh, exclusive, and culturally relevant content to our subscribers. By the time a 90-day window closes, the initial marketing buzz has faded, and the film is perceived as 'old news' by our audience, drastically reducing its value in driving subscriber acquisition and retention.\n\nWe are prepared to be a major financial partner here and help get this film made. StreamVerse can contribute up to $18 million for the exclusive global streaming rights. But to be clear, that investment is entirely contingent on a modern distribution strategy. We would need the film to premiere on our platform no more than 30 days after its theatrical release. That's the only way an investment of this size makes sense for us."

This is his established market rate, and it is non-negotiable. This fee must be a cornerstone of any budget we discuss. Marcus, a $25 million total budget is not a serious proposition if it's meant to include an A-list star of Liam's caliber. We should be discussing production costs *on top* of his fee.\n\nFurthermore, to ensure the artistic integrity of the project\u2014which is what attracted Liam in the first place\u2014he will require an Executive Producer credit and meaningful consultation, specifically approvals over the Director of Photography and his primary co-star.\n\nLiam believes 'The Galway Echo' has the potential to be a major awards contender, and he is committed to that vision. We need to build a deal that supports that level of quality, not undermines it."

      "content": "Thank you, David and Isabella, for putting your cards on the table. It clarifies the challenges we face.\n\nLet's be blunt. We have two foundational models that are currently at odds. Isabella, you're advocating for a budget that supports an A-list star, which we understand. A $20 million fee for Liam, plus production costs, realistically puts this project in the $35-40 million range. My initial cap of $25 million was based on a different production model, one with less top-line talent cost.\n\nDavid, your offer of $18 million is substantial and could certainly help bridge that budget gap. However, your 30-day window requirement directly undermines the very strategy that makes a film like this a success. A robust theatrical run is what builds the word-of-mouth, the critical acclaim, and the awards buzz that Isabella rightly pointed out Liam is seeking. It's what makes the film a cultural event rather than just another tile on a streaming service. A 30-day window guts the box office potential and significantly damages its prestige.\n\nSo, we have a puzzle. We can't have a $40 million budget without a partner like StreamVerse, but we can't build a prestige theatrical film with a 30-day window.\n\nI'm open to discussing a higher total budget if we have co-financing, but the 90-day window is the bedrock of our model for this type of picture. David, given the awards potential here, is there any room for a longer window to allow the film to build its theatrical momentum? That momentum would ultimately make it an even bigger asset when it lands on your platform."

But I believe you're looking at a solution based on an outdated blueprint.\n\nThe idea that 'prestige' is exclusively built over a 90-day theatrical run is no longer a market reality. Some of the most talked-about, award-winning films of the past few years have utilized much shorter, more dynamic windows. The cultural conversation is immediate and intense. A 90-day delay doesn't build prestige; it risks irrelevance.\n\nLet's reframe this. Titan Pictures provides the theatrical launch and the traditional awards campaign. StreamVerse provides a massive, simultaneous global premiere to over 200 million subscribers just as the theatrical buzz hits its peak. That isn't a compromise to the film's prestige; it's a massive amplifier for it. It becomes a global cultural event, not just a domestic box office story.\n\nMy offer of $18 million is a direct investment to make this film at the scale everyone here wants\u2014a scale that accommodates Liam's fee and Lena's vision. But that investment is inextricably linked to the value of a timely release on our platform. At 90 days, the film is a library title. At 30 days, it's a premiere event. Our contribution is for the event, not the library title. \n\nWe can solve the budget gap and get this movie made, but we can't do it using a distribution model from a decade ago."

That is not the film Liam signed on to make, and it's not the film that will win awards. We are backing the artist here, and that artist is Lena.\n\nSo, while you sort out the window, the foundational principle for us is that creative control must remain with the producer, Lena. Without that, there is no project for Liam to be a part of, regardless of the budget."

I understand your business model, but 30 days kneecaps the theatrical run before it even has a chance to build momentum. The awards buzz we all want generates in weeks four, five, and six. You're asking us to pull it from theaters just as it's peaking. A 90-day window is our gold standard for a reason. However, I'm not deaf to the market changes. Let's find a middle ground. What about a 60-day exclusive theatrical window? It gives the film a real theatrical life and still delivers a premiere event for StreamVerse while the conversation is white-hot.\n\nIsabella, your point about artistic integrity is taken. Liam is attaching to Lena's vision, and we respect that. Perhaps 'final approval' was too strong a term. We need to protect our investment and ensure the film is marketable, but we can move from a mandate to a partnership. What if we agree to a structure of 'collaborative notes' where Titan has meaningful input, but Lena, as the producer, retains creative control? \n\nIf we can find a compromise on those two points, the budget becomes a solvable math problem. A 60-day window and a collaborative creative process would justify, from our board's perspective, a larger financial commitment from Titan to get this film made properly, accommodating Liam's fee."

I am absolutely certain that with this budget and creative team, the film will perform exceptionally well both in theaters and on streaming, justifying everyone's investment.\n\nMarcus, you've proposed 60 days. David, you started at 30. To bridge this gap, what if we consider a 45-day exclusive theatrical window? This is a modern, proven model that allows a film to build theatrical momentum and word-of-mouth, while still delivering a massive, timely event for StreamVerse subscribers.\n\nIf we can agree on a 45-day window, we can lock in the $35 million budget. David, would a window of that length still support a significant co-financing contribution from StreamVerse? And Marcus, would that give you the theatrical life you need?

Everyone, it feels like we are incredibly close to a deal that gets this film made at the highest level.\n\nHowever, I must be transparent about the data that drives my decision-making. For StreamVerse, a 45-day window presents the same fundamental problem as a 60-day one. Our analytics show that the subscriber acquisition power of a film declines exponentially after the first 30 days of its theatrical run. At 45 days, the film is no longer a 'must-see-now' event for our audience; it's a 'catch-up' title. My entire investment thesis is based on the former.\n\nSo, rather than incrementally negotiating, I want to propose a final, comprehensive solution that addresses everyone's core needs and gets us across the finish line.\n\nHere is the deal that works for StreamVerse: We will increase our contribution to **$20 million**. In exchange, we secure a **14-day exclusive theatrical window**.\n\nLet's look at what this does for everyone:\n- **Lena & Isabella:** The budget is solved. With my $20 million and Liam's $20 million salary locked in, the total $35M budget is more than achievable. Lena retains creative control, and Liam gets the support he needs.\n- **Marcus:** This dramatically de-risks the project for Titan. You would only need to finance the remaining $15 million to secure a prestige film with a global star, while retaining all theatrical revenue. A 14-day exclusive run, followed by a massive global marketing push on our platform, creates a concentrated, high-impact cultural event that benefits us all.\n\nThis is the package. A major financial commitment from us in exchange for the modern distribution model this film deserves. I believe this is the deal that makes everyone whole."

It solves the budget, allowing us to make the film at the $35 million level it requires to be truly exceptional, which is my ideal scenario.\n\nIsabella, this secures Liam's involvement and protects the artistic vision he signed on for.\n\nAnd Marcus, I genuinely believe this is a fantastic deal for Titan. You get a prestige film with a global star for a fraction of the initial financial risk. You retain all the theatrical revenue from what will be a massive two-week event, and then benefit from the global marketing push from StreamVerse.\n\nThis structure works for everyone. It allows me to protect the writer's vision, it brings an A-list star on board, and it pairs a traditional theatrical launch with a cutting-edge streaming release. This is the path forward. I am ready to formalize this and sign today."
