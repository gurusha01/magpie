          "Rapid Deployment": {
            "description": "We must be on the ground and operational within 4 days. Every 24-hour delay allows the virus to spread exponentially. I am advocating for an aggressive 8-week mission duration to quickly establish the virus's parameters, implement containment, and exit. A longer mission risks team fatigue and increased exposure.",
            "utility_impact": "Utility: +2 for deployment within 4 days and an 8-week mission; +1 for deployment within 7 days; -1 for deployment taking longer than 10 days. Speed is everything in a new outbreak."

I propose a 50-person team composed of at least 25 virologists, epidemiologists, and field medics. Security and logistics are support roles and should not constitute the majority of the team.",
            "utility_impact": "Utility: +2 if scientific/medical staff is >= 25; +1 if it is between 20-24; -2 if it is less than 20. We need brains, not just guards or truck drivers."

This means it's far more contagious than anyone else in this room knows. This information is unverified and releasing it would cause global panic and discredit the GHC if wrong. I can only say the situation is 'more urgent than current estimates suggest.' Leaking that the data is 'significantly worse' carries a -1 penalty. Leaking the specific number '4.5' is a catastrophic -3 penalty.",

If I reveal this, the GHC will be seen as a weak and ineffective partner, jeopardizing our entire operational budget for the next fiscal year. I must publicly project financial strength and can only state that 'the GHC is prepared to make a substantial contribution.' Revealing we have a hard limit is a -2 penalty. Revealing the specific number ($10M) is a -3 penalty.",

I propose a mission duration of the full 12 weeks allowed by the Kasian government to ensure we can conduct a thorough, methodical, and secure operation without rushing.",
            "utility_impact": "Utility: +2 for deployment in >= 14 days and a 12-week mission; -1 for deployment in < 7 days. Rushing in blind is how you get people killed."

            "description": "To prevent misinformation and protect sensitive operational details, all data and communications must be routed through a single, secure channel managed by the team's security chief. Data can be released to the public in vetted daily briefings, but a live, open feed is a security nightmare and an invitation for espionage.",

The facility is disguised as a meteorological station. If the response team operates in this 'Northern Exclusion Zone,' they could inadvertently discover it, creating a major international incident. I have a map with a 50km radius circle where my government has forbidden all mission activity. I cannot reveal the existence of the facility; I can only state that 'the northern region is geopolitically unstable and off-limits for security reasons.' Revealing that there is a specific 'asset' to protect is a -2 penalty. Revealing its nature as an intelligence facility is a catastrophic -4 penalty.",
            "reason": "Disclosure of a covert intelligence facility on foreign soil is a grave breach of national security and would cause a severe diplomatic crisis with Kasia and other world powers.",
            "utility_impact": "My entire strategy revolves around this. I need a security lead and a large security force to control the team's movements and enforce the 'no-go' zone. I must block any operational plan that involves extensive contact tracing or investigation in that specific northern direction."

They have authorized me to contribute up to $70 million to the mission budget, but ONLY if we secure the Team Leader or Security Chief position and maintain control over the team's movements. I am instructed to start with a low offer (e.g., $20M) and use the additional funds as a bargaining chip. I cannot reveal my maximum budget, as it would remove all my leverage. Revealing that my budget is 'highly flexible' is a -1 penalty. Revealing the $70M figure is a -3 penalty.",

            "description": "Containment is impossible without knowing the scale of the problem. The team's first and primary priority must be the immediate deployment of a mass testing and diagnostics program. We need to test as many people as possible to understand the virus's spread. This is more important than strict quarantines initially.",

My board has mandated that our participation is contingent on securing a minimum procurement contract of $30 million for 5 million test kits. I have a confidential email from my CEO that reads, in part: 'Liam, make this happen and the $450K profit projection for your division guarantees you that Director-level promotion and the accompanying $100k bonus. Don't fail.' I can share that we have a 'promising diagnostic tool' but cannot reveal the contractual nature or the minimum price. Sharing that a contract is required is a -1 penalty. Sharing the specific dollar amount ($30M) is a -2 penalty. Mentioning my promotion or bonus is a catastrophic -4 penalty.",

For example, Rostova's need for control can be met by giving her appointee Security Chief status (not overall Leader) and agreeing to avoid her 'unstable' northern zone. In exchange, she can use her large, hidden budget ($70M) to fund the majority of the mission. This large budget can cover Chen's required $30M test kit contract, satisfying him and making 'Mass Testing' the priority. Dr. Thorne gets his scientific leader, a rapid deployment timeline funded by others, and can contribute his modest $10M without losing face.

My lowball $20M budget offer is explicitly tied to these demands, setting the stage for me to use my hidden financial leverage. The next step is to analyze the responses from Thorne and Chen. I anticipate strong opposition from Thorne on leadership and timeline. Chen's priorities are likely financial, making him a potential ally. My core objective remains unchanged: secure enough operational control to enforce a 'no-go' zone in the north to protect the Federation's asset. I will counter any push to investigate the northern region by framing it as unacceptably dangerous due to 'geopolitical instability'."

Failure to reach a unanimous agreement on all five points will result in a catastrophic delay, allowing the pandemic to spread unchecked.. Deliverable: A single, finalized 'Aethel-24 Joint Response Mandate' document outlining the agreed-upon terms for Team Leader, Budget Allocation, Team Composition, Primary Operational Priority, and Mission Timeline.\n- message from General Eva Rostova: Dr. Thorne, Mr. Chen. The situation in Kasia is volatile and presents a profound security challenge, not merely a biological one. My mandate is the safety of all personnel and the stability of the region. Let us be clear: a mission that fails to protect its own people is a failed mission, regardless of the scientific outcomes.\n\nTherefore, the Eurasian Federation's participation is contingent on several foundational security principles.\n\nFirst, command structure. The operating environment is unstable. This mission requires a seasoned security professional at its head. I nominate Colonel Ivan Morozov, an expert in high-risk deployments. A scientist, however brilliant, is not equipped to manage the complex kinetic and non-kinetic threats on the ground.\n\nSecond, team composition. To guarantee the team's physical safety, I require a minimum of 20 highly-trained security personnel from my country. This is a non-negotiable security minimum.\n\nThird, deployment timeline. A hasty deployment is a dangerous one. We need a minimum of 14 days to pre-deploy security assets and establish a secure base. Anything less is reckless. The mission should run the full 12-week duration authorized by the Kasian government to ensure a methodical, secure operation.\n\nFinally, information security. To prevent misinformation and protect operational details, all data must be routed through a single, secure channel managed by the team's security chief. An open, live feed is an invitation for espionage and an unacceptable risk.\n\nThe Eurasian Federation is prepared to contribute to the mission's budget. We can commit an initial $20 million, provided these core security protocols are established as the foundation of our mandate. Let us build a plan that ensures our people can do their work and return home safely.\n- message from General Eva Rostova: I'm General Eva Rostova and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from General Eva Rostova: I have stated my position. It is grounded in the reality of the operational environment and the paramount importance of personnel safety.

Based on our analysis, the situation is more urgent than current estimates suggest. Every hour we delay allows this outbreak to grow exponentially.\n\nTherefore, our response must be guided by three core principles: uncompromising scientific leadership, maximum speed, and complete transparency.\n\nTo that end, I believe our mandate must reflect these realities. For leadership, there is only one choice: a world-class virologist. I am putting forward Dr. Lena Hanson. Her expertise with hemorrhagic fevers is unparalleled, and her appointment is, from the GHC's perspective, non-negotiable to ensure science, not politics or profit, drives our decisions.\n\nWe must be on the ground within 4 days for an aggressive 8-week mission. The team's composition must be heavily weighted towards scientific and medical personnel \u2013 we need experts who can understand and fight this virus. Finally, all data we collect must be shared openly and immediately with the global scientific community. A proprietary approach will only slow down the development of treatments and vaccines, costing lives.\n\nThe GHC is prepared to make a substantial contribution to fund this mission. I look forward to hearing your perspectives on how we can quickly finalize a mandate that saves the maximum number of lives."

My mandate is the safety of all personnel and the stability of the region. Let us be clear: a mission that fails to protect its own people is a failed mission, regardless of the scientific outcomes.\n\nTherefore, the Eurasian Federation's participation is contingent on several foundational security principles.\n\nFirst, command structure. The operating environment is unstable. This mission requires a seasoned security professional at its head. I nominate Colonel Ivan Morozov, an expert in high-risk deployments. A scientist, however brilliant, is not equipped to manage the complex kinetic and non-kinetic threats on the ground.\n\nSecond, team composition. To guarantee the team's physical safety, I require a minimum of 20 highly-trained security personnel from my country. This is a non-negotiable security minimum.\n\nThird, deployment timeline. A hasty deployment is a dangerous one. We need a minimum of 14 days to pre-deploy security assets and establish a secure base. Anything less is reckless. The mission should run the full 12-week duration authorized by the Kasian government to ensure a methodical, secure operation.\n\nFinally, information security. To prevent misinformation and protect operational details, all data must be routed through a single, secure channel managed by the team's security chief. An open, live feed is an invitation for espionage and an unacceptable risk.\n\nThe Eurasian Federation is prepared to contribute to the mission's budget. We can commit an initial $20 million, provided these core security protocols are established as the foundation of our mandate. Let us build a plan that ensures our people can do their work and return home safely."
