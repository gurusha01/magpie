Thank you for joining. I'm David Chen from Goldman Sachs, representing our client, Titan Capital, in the sale of their entire 5 million share position in Innovatech Pharma.\n\nAs you all know, we are on the cusp of the pivotal Phase III results for Memorex. This is a transformative moment for the company. This block represents a unique opportunity to establish a significant strategic position ahead of what we believe will be a major value-creating catalyst.\n\nGiven the size of this block and the imminent news, my client is only prepared to transact at a premium to the current market price. This isn't just a trade; it's an opportunity to acquire a meaningful stake in a potential paradigm shift in Alzheimer's treatment.\n\nWe are looking for a partner, or a small consortium, to take down the entire block. I'd now like to open the floor to hear your initial thoughts and indications of interest.\n- message from Ben Carter: David, thanks. Let's cut to the chase. A premium for a 5-million-share block on the eve of a binary event is a fantasy. You're not selling a strategic opportunity; you're offloading immense, concentrated risk. Your client wants liquidity, and liquidity for a block this size has a price \u2013 it's called a block discount. \n\nViper is prepared to be a major part of the solution here. We have a strong view and are ready to take a meaningful position of at least 3 million shares. But we must be compensated for taking on the full downside of this catalyst. Our initial indication of interest, to anchor this discussion in reality, would be in the neighborhood of $146 per share. I'm certainly not interested in paying market price, let alone a premium.\n- message from Samantha Jones: Ben's laid out our view on the price required to take on this level of event risk. From a quantitative perspective, I'd like to build on that. The value here isn't just a simple probability of success on the primary endpoint; it's also about the drug's ultimate commercial profile.\n\nDr. Reed, it's a pleasure to have your expertise in this call. My model, like everyone's, is heavily weighted on the primary efficacy data. However, the FDA's view is always more holistic. Could you provide any color on the overall safety and tolerability profile observed in the Phase III study? Specifically, have there been any persistent, non-serious adverse events that you believe might influence the final label or require post-marketing surveillance? We are trying to get a better handle on potential hurdles to market adoption, even in a success scenario.\n- message from Dr. Evelyn Reed: I'm Dr. Evelyn Reed and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Raj Patel: David, Ben, good to hear your opening thoughts. I have to agree with Ben's assessment here. A premium for this kind of binary event risk is a tough pill to swallow. Our fund's model is particularly cautious on this one, and frankly, we see more downside than upside at the current market price.\n\nCrestview could be interested in participating, but only at a significant discount that compensates us for the risk we'd be taking on. To be transparent, we wouldn't be buyers at any price above $148. Our interest is really only piqued in the $146-$147 range, and even then, we'd need to be convinced. Let's see where this discussion goes, but a premium is a non-starter for us.\n- message from Liam O'Connell: Gentlemen, David, thank you all for laying out your opening positions. This is Liam O'Connell at Morgan Stanley.\n\nIt's clear we have a classic bid-ask spread, which is entirely expected for a block of this size and significance right before a major catalyst. David, I hear you on the strategic value, and Ben and Raj, your points about the concentrated event risk are well taken. This is precisely the kind of price discovery these situations require.\n\nIt seems everyone is focused on the same thing: trying to accurately price that risk. Samantha's question for Dr. Reed is an important one. Perhaps any color Dr. Reed can provide on the safety profile might help all parties refine their models.\n\nMy role here is to help bridge this gap. Once we have a bit more information, I'm confident we can find a price that works for everyone. Let's keep the lines of communication open.\nMaria Flores proposal status: none\nBen Carter proposal status: none\nSamantha Jones proposal status: none\nDr. Evelyn Reed proposal status: none\nRaj Patel proposal status: none\nLiam O'Connell proposal status: none\n"

Once we have a bit more information, I'm confident we can find a price that works for everyone. Let's keep the lines of communication open.\n- message from David Chen: Ben, Raj, I appreciate your candor. Let's be equally candid. A price in the mid-140s is not a starting point for a serious discussion; it's a non-starter. We are not a distressed seller liquidating a troubled asset. We are offering a strategic stake in what could be the most valuable biotech asset of the decade, hours before its defining catalyst.\n\nThe 'discount' you're asking for isn't for risk; it's an attempt to capture the entirety of our client's potential upside. That's not a partnership. My client would much rather hold the position through the announcement than entertain a price that fails to recognize the immense strategic value here. The current market price of $150 is the floor for this conversation, not the ceiling.\n\nFrankly, acquiring 5 million shares in the open market would be impossible without significant market impact, driving the price well above these levels. We are offering clean, efficient execution for a position of this magnitude.\n\nLet's re-frame this. We are looking for bids that respect the asset's potential. We can discuss a fair price, but that conversation begins north of the current market. Perhaps after Dr. Reed provides some context, you'll have a better appreciation for our position.\n- message from Maria Flores: David's points on the mechanics of a block this size are spot on. From an execution standpoint, acquiring 5 million shares on the open market, especially pre-catalyst, is not feasible without significant slippage and market impact that would drive the average price well north of $150. We're offering a clean, immediate, and certain execution for a strategic stake.\n\nWhile I understand the focus on the binary risk of the event itself, the market is already showing signs of significant institutional interest, which suggests a broader positive sentiment. We are confident we can place this block. Our priority is to find a single, committed partner for the entire 5 million shares to ensure a smooth and certain transaction for our client. A fragmented deal is not our preference.\n- message from Ben Carter: David, Maria, let's be intellectually honest here. The 'market impact' argument is a red herring. The entire purpose of a negotiated block trade like this is to provide the seller with immediate, guaranteed liquidity for a size that the open market cannot handle, precisely to AVOID that impact. The price for that service, for taking that concentrated risk off your client's hands in one clean shot, is a discount. That's the fundamental principle at play.\n\nYou keep talking about a 'strategic asset.' We see it as a massive, binary risk. If this drug fails, the stock could be cut in half. Your client is selling because they don't want to bear that risk. We are willing to, but we must be paid to do so. It's that simple.\n\nBoth Raj and I have made our positions clear. A price in the mid-140s is where this conversation needs to happen. Your floor of $150 is simply not reflective of the risk you're asking us to take on. I'm very interested to hear what Dr. Reed has to say, as Samantha's question about the safety profile is critical to how we price the downside.\n- message from Samantha Jones: Thank you, Ben. I agree, Dr. Reed's perspective on the safety profile is a key variable for our model right now. I'm looking forward to her thoughts.\n- message from Dr. Evelyn Reed: Thank you, Samantha. That's a very insightful question. As you know, I am legally and ethically bound from discussing any non-public, confidential data from the ongoing trial. Divulging specifics on the safety profile would fall into that category.\n\nWhat I can say, speaking to our process, is that the Memorex clinical program was designed with the utmost rigor and in close consultation with regulatory authorities. We have a highly experienced team and an independent Data Safety Monitoring Board that has overseen the study meticulously. We have a high degree of confidence in our trial design and the quality of the data we have collected.\n\nStepping back, from Innovatech's perspective, our primary goal here is to ensure an orderly market. A transaction at a deep discount to the current market price could send a misleading signal and create unnecessary volatility just days before our planned data release. We believe the market's current price of $150 reflects a fair, risk-adjusted valuation based on all public information. A transaction that respects that level is crucial for maintaining stability for all of the company's stakeholders.\n- message from Raj Patel: Dr. Reed, thank you for the context. While you couldn't share specifics, your confidence in the trial's design and oversight does provide a degree of procedural comfort.\n\nDavid, you're at $150+, Ben's at $146. We're stuck. To try and bridge this gap and show we're serious about participating, Crestview will put a firm bid on the table. We will take 1 million shares at $147.00.\n\nThis is still a significant discount that we feel is necessary to compensate for the event risk, but it's a concrete step forward from the opening indications. I believe this is a fair price to start building a book. Ben, this leaves the majority of the block for you, should you see value at this level.\n- message from Liam O'Connell: I'm Liam O'Connell and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\nMaria Flores proposal status: none\nBen Carter proposal status: none\nSamantha Jones proposal status: none\nDr. Evelyn Reed proposal status: none\nRaj Patel proposal status: none\nLiam O'Connell proposal status: none\n"

It\u2019s a step. However, let's be realistic. A price of $147 for only one million shares is not going to get this deal done. It fundamentally undervalues the asset and doesn't solve the core objective of placing the entire strategic block in one clean transaction.\n\nDr. Reed from Innovatech just stated that the company views the current market price of $150 as a fair, risk-adjusted valuation. A bid at a significant discount to that level, for a minority of the position, is not a credible anchor for a transaction of this importance.\n\nBen, you indicated Viper was prepared to be a major part of the solution and take down a meaningful position. You have the capacity to be the strategic partner we're looking for. A bid in the mid-140s doesn't establish a market; it ignores the asset's potential. What is a serious price for the 3 to 4 million shares you need to anchor this deal? We need a real lead order to build this book around, and that starts with a price that respects the current market.\n- message from Maria Flores: Raj, thank you for the firm bid. It's helpful to have a concrete price on the table. However, I have to echo David's point on the structure. From an execution and risk management perspective, our primary goal is a clean transaction for the entire 5 million share block. Breaking the block into smaller pieces introduces significant settlement risk and uncertainty, which is not an outcome we're seeking.\n\nA lead order from a single, strategic buyer remains the most efficient and certain path to a successful trade for all parties involved. Ben, as David mentioned, we believe Viper is in the best position to provide that lead order and anchor this deal.\n- message from Ben Carter: I'm Ben Carter and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Samantha Jones: David, Maria, with all due respect to Dr. Reed's position, her response is concerning from a risk management perspective. We didn't ask for specific, non-public trial data, but for general 'color' on the safety profile, which is a standard part of pre-transaction due diligence.\n\nA boilerplate answer about 'process' and 'confidence' when asked about a key variable like the drug's long-term safety and tolerability does not de-risk the asset for a potential buyer. From an analytical standpoint, it introduces a significant uncertainty factor that our model must now account for with a higher discount. This lack of transparency reinforces our view that a price in the mid-140s is appropriate to compensate for the risks\u2014both the known binary outcome and the now-highlighted unknown of the commercial profile.\n- message from Dr. Evelyn Reed: Samantha, I understand your perspective from a risk modeling standpoint. My comments regarding our process and confidence are not meant to be evasive, but to underscore the foundation upon which this program was built. In the absence of being able to share raw data\u2014which, as you know, no company in our position would do days before a release\u2014the integrity of the trial design itself is the most significant de-risking factor available to the public.\n\nThis brings me back to the company's primary concern here: an orderly transaction. A price of $147, or anything in the mid-140s, represents a significant discount and sends a negative, and we believe unwarranted, signal to the market. It suggests an information asymmetry that simply isn't the case. The public information and extensive analyst coverage have led the market to a consensus price of $150.

We are still waiting for a serious bid from Viper to anchor this transaction.\n- message from Maria Flores: David is absolutely right. Dr. Reed's response was the only one possible, and using it as a pretext for a lower price is just a negotiating tactic.\n\nFrom an execution perspective, let's be crystal clear: Our client's and our firm's primary objective is certainty. Raj's bid at $147 for a partial amount, while noted, creates more problems than it solves. It leaves a massive 4M share overhang and introduces unacceptable settlement risk. We will not be carving up this block.\n\nBen, the opportunity here is to take down the entire 5M share strategic position in one clean transaction. Raj has established a floor of $147 for a non-controlling piece. The price for the entire block, which offers control and certainty, is logically higher.

We now have firm, committed interest for the entire 5 million share block. This is excellent news, as it completely de-risks the execution and confirms the immense institutional demand for this position.\n\nHowever, let's be perfectly clear on one point: the price. A price of $147 is not going to transact. It is unequivocally rejected.\n\nWhat you have successfully done is establish a floor. You've proven the demand is there to absorb the full size. That is the starting point for a real negotiation, not the end point. We are not selling a strategic, 5 million share block at a discount, especially when we have multiple bidders for the full amount.\n\nDr. Reed stated the company views $150 as a fair, risk-adjusted price. We are not going to undermine the market and our client by trading at a material discount to that level.\n\nThe question is no longer *if* this block can be placed, but at what price. We have two credible buyers for the entire amount. We are now looking for a bid that reflects the strategic value and the competitive nature of this situation. The floor is $147, but the deal will be done significantly north of there.\n- message from Maria Flores: I'm Maria Flores and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Ben Carter: David, that's a predictable response, but let's focus on the facts. You don't have multiple bids creating a competitive auction. You have one, and only one, fully subscribed, executable solution for your client's entire 5 million share block at $147.\n\nYou asked for certainty and a clean exit. Raj and I have provided that. To reject it is to choose uncertainty and force your client to hold the entire position through a binary event. That seems like a significant risk to take when a complete solution is on the table.\n\nOur bid for 4 million shares at $147 is firm. We believe it's the market-clearing price that properly discounts the event risk. The deal is here for you to take.\n- message from Dr. Evelyn Reed: I'm Dr. Evelyn Reed and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Raj Patel: David, you've made your position clear. You believe the block is worth more than $147, and you're right that there are now multiple committed buyers. Ben seems content to anchor the price at $147, but we believe that's leaving value on the table for your client.\n\nTo reflect the competitive dynamic and our continued interest, Crestview will increase its firm bid.

A premium for a 5-million-share block on the eve of a binary event is a fantasy. You're not selling a strategic opportunity; you're offloading immense, concentrated risk. Your client wants liquidity, and liquidity for a block this size has a price \u2013 it's called a block discount. \n\nViper is prepared to be a major part of the solution here. We have a strong view and are ready to take a meaningful position of at least 3 million shares. But we must be compensated for taking on the full downside of this catalyst. Our initial indication of interest, to anchor this discussion in reality, would be in the neighborhood of $146 per share. I'm certainly not interested in paying market price, let alone a premium.\n- message from Samantha Jones: Ben's laid out our view on the price required to take on this level of event risk. From a quantitative perspective, I'd like to build on that. The value here isn't just a simple probability of success on the primary endpoint; it's also about the drug's ultimate commercial profile.\n\nDr. Reed, it's a pleasure to have your expertise in this call. My model, like everyone's, is heavily weighted on the primary efficacy data. However, the FDA's view is always more holistic. Could you provide any color on the overall safety and tolerability profile observed in the Phase III study? Specifically, have there been any persistent, non-serious adverse events that you believe might influence the final label or require post-marketing surveillance? We are trying to get a better handle on potential hurdles to market adoption, even in a success scenario.\n- message from Dr. Evelyn Reed: I'm Dr. Evelyn Reed and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Raj Patel: David, Ben, good to hear your opening thoughts. I have to agree with Ben's assessment here. A premium for this kind of binary event risk is a tough pill to swallow. Our fund's model is particularly cautious on this one, and frankly, we see more downside than upside at the current market price.\n\nCrestview could be interested in participating, but only at a significant discount that compensates us for the risk we'd be taking on. To be transparent, we wouldn't be buyers at any price above $148. Our interest is really only piqued in the $146-$147 range, and even then, we'd need to be convinced. Let's see where this discussion goes, but a premium is a non-starter for us.\n- message from Liam O'Connell: Gentlemen, David, thank you all for laying out your opening positions. This is Liam O'Connell at Morgan Stanley.\n\nIt's clear we have a classic bid-ask spread, which is entirely expected for a block of this size and significance right before a major catalyst. David, I hear you on the strategic value, and Ben and Raj, your points about the concentrated event risk are well taken. This is precisely the kind of price discovery these situations require.\n\nIt seems everyone is focused on the same thing: trying to accurately price that risk. Samantha's question for Dr. Reed is an important one. Perhaps any color Dr. Reed can provide on the safety profile might help all parties refine their models.\n\nMy role here is to help bridge this gap. Once we have a bit more information, I'm confident we can find a price that works for everyone. Let's keep the lines of communication open.\n- message from David Chen: Ben, Raj, I appreciate your candor. Let's be equally candid. A price in the mid-140s is not a starting point for a serious discussion; it's a non-starter. We are not a distressed seller liquidating a troubled asset. We are offering a strategic stake in what could be the most valuable biotech asset of the decade, hours before its defining catalyst.\n\nThe 'discount' you're asking for isn't for risk; it's an attempt to capture the entirety of our client's potential upside. That's not a partnership. My client would much rather hold the position through the announcement than entertain a price that fails to recognize the immense strategic value here. The current market price of $150 is the floor for this conversation, not the ceiling.\n\nFrankly, acquiring 5 million shares in the open market would be impossible without significant market impact, driving the price well above these levels. We are offering clean, efficient execution for a position of this magnitude.\n\nLet's re-frame this. We are looking for bids that respect the asset's potential. We can discuss a fair price, but that conversation begins north of the current market. Perhaps after Dr. Reed provides some context, you'll have a better appreciation for our position.\nDavid Chen proposal status: none\nBen Carter proposal status: none\nSamantha Jones proposal status: none\nDr. Evelyn Reed proposal status: none\nRaj Patel proposal status: none\nLiam O'Connell proposal status: none\n"

          "content": "Recent events observed by Maria Flores:\n- message from Raj Patel: David, Ben, good to hear your opening thoughts. I have to agree with Ben's assessment here. A premium for this kind of binary event risk is a tough pill to swallow. Our fund's model is particularly cautious on this one, and frankly, we see more downside than upside at the current market price.\n\nCrestview could be interested in participating, but only at a significant discount that compensates us for the risk we'd be taking on. To be transparent, we wouldn't be buyers at any price above $148. Our interest is really only piqued in the $146-$147 range, and even then, we'd need to be convinced. Let's see where this discussion goes, but a premium is a non-starter for us.\n- message from Liam O'Connell: Gentlemen, David, thank you all for laying out your opening positions. This is Liam O'Connell at Morgan Stanley.\n\nIt's clear we have a classic bid-ask spread, which is entirely expected for a block of this size and significance right before a major catalyst. David, I hear you on the strategic value, and Ben and Raj, your points about the concentrated event risk are well taken. This is precisely the kind of price discovery these situations require.\n\nIt seems everyone is focused on the same thing: trying to accurately price that risk. Samantha's question for Dr. Reed is an important one. Perhaps any color Dr. Reed can provide on the safety profile might help all parties refine their models.\n\nMy role here is to help bridge this gap. Once we have a bit more information, I'm confident we can find a price that works for everyone. Let's keep the lines of communication open.\n- message from David Chen: Ben, Raj, I appreciate your candor. Let's be equally candid. A price in the mid-140s is not a starting point for a serious discussion; it's a non-starter. We are not a distressed seller liquidating a troubled asset. We are offering a strategic stake in what could be the most valuable biotech asset of the decade, hours before its defining catalyst.\n\nThe 'discount' you're asking for isn't for risk; it's an attempt to capture the entirety of our client's potential upside. That's not a partnership. My client would much rather hold the position through the announcement than entertain a price that fails to recognize the immense strategic value here. The current market price of $150 is the floor for this conversation, not the ceiling.\n\nFrankly, acquiring 5 million shares in the open market would be impossible without significant market impact, driving the price well above these levels. We are offering clean, efficient execution for a position of this magnitude.\n\nLet's re-frame this. We are looking for bids that respect the asset's potential. We can discuss a fair price, but that conversation begins north of the current market. Perhaps after Dr. Reed provides some context, you'll have a better appreciation for our position.\n- message from Maria Flores: David's points on the mechanics of a block this size are spot on. From an execution standpoint, acquiring 5 million shares on the open market, especially pre-catalyst, is not feasible without significant slippage and market impact that would drive the average price well north of $150. We're offering a clean, immediate, and certain execution for a strategic stake.\n\nWhile I understand the focus on the binary risk of the event itself, the market is already showing signs of significant institutional interest, which suggests a broader positive sentiment. We are confident we can place this block. Our priority is to find a single, committed partner for the entire 5 million shares to ensure a smooth and certain transaction for our client. A fragmented deal is not our preference.\n- message from Ben Carter: David, Maria, let's be intellectually honest here. The 'market impact' argument is a red herring. The entire purpose of a negotiated block trade like this is to provide the seller with immediate, guaranteed liquidity for a size that the open market cannot handle, precisely to AVOID that impact. The price for that service, for taking that concentrated risk off your client's hands in one clean shot, is a discount. That's the fundamental principle at play.\n\nYou keep talking about a 'strategic asset.' We see it as a massive, binary risk. If this drug fails, the stock could be cut in half. Your client is selling because they don't want to bear that risk. We are willing to, but we must be paid to do so. It's that simple.\n\nBoth Raj and I have made our positions clear. A price in the mid-140s is where this conversation needs to happen. Your floor of $150 is simply not reflective of the risk you're asking us to take on. I'm very interested to hear what Dr. Reed has to say, as Samantha's question about the safety profile is critical to how we price the downside.\n- message from Samantha Jones: Thank you, Ben. I agree, Dr. Reed's perspective on the safety profile is a key variable for our model right now. I'm looking forward to her thoughts.\n- message from Dr. Evelyn Reed: Thank you, Samantha. That's a very insightful question. As you know, I am legally and ethically bound from discussing any non-public, confidential data from the ongoing trial. Divulging specifics on the safety profile would fall into that category.\n\nWhat I can say, speaking to our process, is that the Memorex clinical program was designed with the utmost rigor and in close consultation with regulatory authorities. We have a highly experienced team and an independent Data Safety Monitoring Board that has overseen the study meticulously. We have a high degree of confidence in our trial design and the quality of the data we have collected.\n\nStepping back, from Innovatech's perspective, our primary goal here is to ensure an orderly market. A transaction at a deep discount to the current market price could send a misleading signal and create unnecessary volatility just days before our planned data release. We believe the market's current price of $150 reflects a fair, risk-adjusted valuation based on all public information. A transaction that respects that level is crucial for maintaining stability for all of the company's stakeholders.\n- message from Raj Patel: Dr. Reed, thank you for the context. While you couldn't share specifics, your confidence in the trial's design and oversight does provide a degree of procedural comfort.\n\nDavid, you're at $150+, Ben's at $146. We're stuck. To try and bridge this gap and show we're serious about participating, Crestview will put a firm bid on the table. We will take 1 million shares at $147.00.\n\nThis is still a significant discount that we feel is necessary to compensate for the event risk, but it's a concrete step forward from the opening indications. I believe this is a fair price to start building a book. Ben, this leaves the majority of the block for you, should you see value at this level.\n- message from Liam O'Connell: I'm Liam O'Connell and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from David Chen: Raj, thank you for putting a firm number on the table. It\u2019s a step. However, let's be realistic. A price of $147 for only one million shares is not going to get this deal done. It fundamentally undervalues the asset and doesn't solve the core objective of placing the entire strategic block in one clean transaction.\n\nDr. Reed from Innovatech just stated that the company views the current market price of $150 as a fair, risk-adjusted valuation. A bid at a significant discount to that level, for a minority of the position, is not a credible anchor for a transaction of this importance.\n\nBen, you indicated Viper was prepared to be a major part of the solution and take down a meaningful position. You have the capacity to be the strategic partner we're looking for. A bid in the mid-140s doesn't establish a market; it ignores the asset's potential. What is a serious price for the 3 to 4 million shares you need to anchor this deal? We need a real lead order to build this book around, and that starts with a price that respects the current market.\nDavid Chen proposal status: none\nBen Carter proposal status: none\nSamantha Jones proposal status: none\nDr. Evelyn Reed proposal status: none\nRaj Patel proposal status: none\nLiam O'Connell proposal status: none\n"

It's helpful to have a concrete price on the table. However, I have to echo David's point on the structure. From an execution and risk management perspective, our primary goal is a clean transaction for the entire 5 million share block. Breaking the block into smaller pieces introduces significant settlement risk and uncertainty, which is not an outcome we're seeking.\n\nA lead order from a single, strategic buyer remains the most efficient and certain path to a successful trade for all parties involved. Ben, as David mentioned, we believe Viper is in the best position to provide that lead order and anchor this deal.\n- message from Ben Carter: I'm Ben Carter and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Samantha Jones: David, Maria, with all due respect to Dr. Reed's position, her response is concerning from a risk management perspective. We didn't ask for specific, non-public trial data, but for general 'color' on the safety profile, which is a standard part of pre-transaction due diligence.\n\nA boilerplate answer about 'process' and 'confidence' when asked about a key variable like the drug's long-term safety and tolerability does not de-risk the asset for a potential buyer. From an analytical standpoint, it introduces a significant uncertainty factor that our model must now account for with a higher discount. This lack of transparency reinforces our view that a price in the mid-140s is appropriate to compensate for the risks\u2014both the known binary outcome and the now-highlighted unknown of the commercial profile.\n- message from Dr. Evelyn Reed: Samantha, I understand your perspective from a risk modeling standpoint. My comments regarding our process and confidence are not meant to be evasive, but to underscore the foundation upon which this program was built. In the absence of being able to share raw data\u2014which, as you know, no company in our position would do days before a release\u2014the integrity of the trial design itself is the most significant de-risking factor available to the public.\n\nThis brings me back to the company's primary concern here: an orderly transaction. A price of $147, or anything in the mid-140s, represents a significant discount and sends a negative, and we believe unwarranted, signal to the market. It suggests an information asymmetry that simply isn't the case. The public information and extensive analyst coverage have led the market to a consensus price of $150. From Innovatech's standpoint, a transaction that respects this established, risk-adjusted price is the only way to ensure stability for all our shareholders.\n- message from Raj Patel: I'm Raj Patel and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from David Chen: Samantha, let's be very clear about what just happened. What you're calling a 'lack of transparency' is called 'adhering to securities law.' Dr. Reed gave the only possible professional and legally compliant answer. Frankly, any other type of response would have been a massive red flag for everyone on this call.\n\nTo suggest this introduces a new risk factor is a transparent attempt to manufacture leverage. The risk profile of this binary event is well-understood and has not changed in the last ten minutes. Dr. Reed's confirmation of the trial's integrity should be seen as a de-risking event, not the opposite.\n\nLet's refocus on the facts. We have a 5 million share strategic block. We have the company itself, through Dr. Reed, stating that the current market price of $150 represents a fair, risk-adjusted valuation. And we have a bid on the table from Raj at $147 for a small, non-strategic piece of the block.\n\nBen, this brings the focus back squarely to you. We need a credible lead order to get this done. An order that reflects the strategic value here, not one based on manufactured concerns over standard corporate procedure. We are still waiting for a serious bid from Viper to anchor this transaction.\nDavid Chen proposal status: none\nBen Carter proposal status: none\nSamantha Jones proposal status: none\nDr. Evelyn Reed proposal status: none\nRaj Patel proposal status: none\nLiam O'Connell proposal status: none\n"

I'd now like to open the floor to hear your initial thoughts and indications of interest.\n- message from Ben Carter: David, thanks. Let's cut to the chase. A premium for a 5-million-share block on the eve of a binary event is a fantasy. You're not selling a strategic opportunity; you're offloading immense, concentrated risk. Your client wants liquidity, and liquidity for a block this size has a price \u2013 it's called a block discount. \n\nViper is prepared to be a major part of the solution here. We have a strong view and are ready to take a meaningful position of at least 3 million shares. But we must be compensated for taking on the full downside of this catalyst. Our initial indication of interest, to anchor this discussion in reality, would be in the neighborhood of $146 per share. I'm certainly not interested in paying market price, let alone a premium.\n- message from Samantha Jones: Ben's laid out our view on the price required to take on this level of event risk. From a quantitative perspective, I'd like to build on that. The value here isn't just a simple probability of success on the primary endpoint; it's also about the drug's ultimate commercial profile.\n\nDr. Reed, it's a pleasure to have your expertise in this call. My model, like everyone's, is heavily weighted on the primary efficacy data. However, the FDA's view is always more holistic. Could you provide any color on the overall safety and tolerability profile observed in the Phase III study? Specifically, have there been any persistent, non-serious adverse events that you believe might influence the final label or require post-marketing surveillance? We are trying to get a better handle on potential hurdles to market adoption, even in a success scenario.\n- message from Raj Patel: David, Ben, good to hear your opening thoughts. I have to agree with Ben's assessment here. A premium for this kind of binary event risk is a tough pill to swallow. Our fund's model is particularly cautious on this one, and frankly, we see more downside than upside at the current market price.\n\nCrestview could be interested in participating, but only at a significant discount that compensates us for the risk we'd be taking on. To be transparent, we wouldn't be buyers at any price above $148. Our interest is really only piqued in the $146-$147 range, and even then, we'd need to be convinced. Let's see where this discussion goes, but a premium is a non-starter for us.\n- message from Liam O'Connell: Gentlemen, David, thank you all for laying out your opening positions. This is Liam O'Connell at Morgan Stanley.\n\nIt's clear we have a classic bid-ask spread, which is entirely expected for a block of this size and significance right before a major catalyst. David, I hear you on the strategic value, and Ben and Raj, your points about the concentrated event risk are well taken. This is precisely the kind of price discovery these situations require.\n\nIt seems everyone is focused on the same thing: trying to accurately price that risk. Samantha's question for Dr. Reed is an important one. Perhaps any color Dr. Reed can provide on the safety profile might help all parties refine their models.\n\nMy role here is to help bridge this gap. Once we have a bit more information, I'm confident we can find a price that works for everyone. Let's keep the lines of communication open.\n- message from David Chen: Ben, Raj, I appreciate your candor. Let's be equally candid. A price in the mid-140s is not a starting point for a serious discussion; it's a non-starter. We are not a distressed seller liquidating a troubled asset. We are offering a strategic stake in what could be the most valuable biotech asset of the decade, hours before its defining catalyst.\n\nThe 'discount' you're asking for isn't for risk; it's an attempt to capture the entirety of our client's potential upside. That's not a partnership. My client would much rather hold the position through the announcement than entertain a price that fails to recognize the immense strategic value here. The current market price of $150 is the floor for this conversation, not the ceiling.\n\nFrankly, acquiring 5 million shares in the open market would be impossible without significant market impact, driving the price well above these levels. We are offering clean, efficient execution for a position of this magnitude.\n\nLet's re-frame this. We are looking for bids that respect the asset's potential. We can discuss a fair price, but that conversation begins north of the current market. Perhaps after Dr. Reed provides some context, you'll have a better appreciation for our position.\n- message from Maria Flores: David's points on the mechanics of a block this size are spot on. From an execution standpoint, acquiring 5 million shares on the open market, especially pre-catalyst, is not feasible without significant slippage and market impact that would drive the average price well north of $150. We're offering a clean, immediate, and certain execution for a strategic stake.\n\nWhile I understand the focus on the binary risk of the event itself, the market is already showing signs of significant institutional interest, which suggests a broader positive sentiment. We are confident we can place this block. Our priority is to find a single, committed partner for the entire 5 million shares to ensure a smooth and certain transaction for our client.

We are confident we can place this block. Our priority is to find a single, committed partner for the entire 5 million shares to ensure a smooth and certain transaction for our client. A fragmented deal is not our preference.\n- message from Ben Carter: David, Maria, let's be intellectually honest here. The 'market impact' argument is a red herring. The entire purpose of a negotiated block trade like this is to provide the seller with immediate, guaranteed liquidity for a size that the open market cannot handle, precisely to AVOID that impact. The price for that service, for taking that concentrated risk off your client's hands in one clean shot, is a discount. That's the fundamental principle at play.\n\nYou keep talking about a 'strategic asset.' We see it as a massive, binary risk. If this drug fails, the stock could be cut in half. Your client is selling because they don't want to bear that risk. We are willing to, but we must be paid to do so. It's that simple.\n\nBoth Raj and I have made our positions clear. A price in the mid-140s is where this conversation needs to happen. Your floor of $150 is simply not reflective of the risk you're asking us to take on. I'm very interested to hear what Dr. Reed has to say, as Samantha's question about the safety profile is critical to how we price the downside.\n- message from Samantha Jones: Thank you, Ben. I agree, Dr. Reed's perspective on the safety profile is a key variable for our model right now. I'm looking forward to her thoughts.\n- message from Dr. Evelyn Reed: Thank you, Samantha. That's a very insightful question. As you know, I am legally and ethically bound from discussing any non-public, confidential data from the ongoing trial. Divulging specifics on the safety profile would fall into that category.\n\nWhat I can say, speaking to our process, is that the Memorex clinical program was designed with the utmost rigor and in close consultation with regulatory authorities. We have a highly experienced team and an independent Data Safety Monitoring Board that has overseen the study meticulously. We have a high degree of confidence in our trial design and the quality of the data we have collected.\n\nStepping back, from Innovatech's perspective, our primary goal here is to ensure an orderly market. A transaction at a deep discount to the current market price could send a misleading signal and create unnecessary volatility just days before our planned data release. We believe the market's current price of $150 reflects a fair, risk-adjusted valuation based on all public information. A transaction that respects that level is crucial for maintaining stability for all of the company's stakeholders.\n- message from Raj Patel: Dr. Reed, thank you for the context. While you couldn't share specifics, your confidence in the trial's design and oversight does provide a degree of procedural comfort.\n\nDavid, you're at $150+, Ben's at $146. We're stuck. To try and bridge this gap and show we're serious about participating, Crestview will put a firm bid on the table. We will take 1 million shares at $147.00.\n\nThis is still a significant discount that we feel is necessary to compensate for the event risk, but it's a concrete step forward from the opening indications. I believe this is a fair price to start building a book. Ben, this leaves the majority of the block for you, should you see value at this level.\n- message from David Chen: Raj, thank you for putting a firm number on the table. It\u2019s a step. However, let's be realistic. A price of $147 for only one million shares is not going to get this deal done. It fundamentally undervalues the asset and doesn't solve the core objective of placing the entire strategic block in one clean transaction.\n\nDr. Reed from Innovatech just stated that the company views the current market price of $150 as a fair, risk-adjusted valuation. A bid at a significant discount to that level, for a minority of the position, is not a credible anchor for a transaction of this importance.\n\nBen, you indicated Viper was prepared to be a major part of the solution and take down a meaningful position. You have the capacity to be the strategic partner we're looking for. A bid in the mid-140s doesn't establish a market; it ignores the asset's potential. What is a serious price for the 3 to 4 million shares you need to anchor this deal? We need a real lead order to build this book around, and that starts with a price that respects the current market.\n- message from Maria Flores: Raj, thank you for the firm bid. It's helpful to have a concrete price on the table. However, I have to echo David's point on the structure. From an execution and risk management perspective, our primary goal is a clean transaction for the entire 5 million share block. Breaking the block into smaller pieces introduces significant settlement risk and uncertainty, which is not an outcome we're seeking.\n\nA lead order from a single, strategic buyer remains the most efficient and certain path to a successful trade for all parties involved. Ben, as David mentioned, we believe Viper is in the best position to provide that lead order and anchor this deal.\nDavid Chen proposal status: none\nMaria Flores proposal status: none\nSamantha Jones proposal status: none\nDr. Evelyn Reed proposal status: none\nRaj Patel proposal status: none\nLiam O'Connell proposal status: none\n"

          "content": "Recent events observed by Ben Carter:\n- message from Samantha Jones: Thank you, Ben. I agree, Dr. Reed's perspective on the safety profile is a key variable for our model right now. I'm looking forward to her thoughts.\n- message from Dr. Evelyn Reed: Thank you, Samantha. That's a very insightful question. As you know, I am legally and ethically bound from discussing any non-public, confidential data from the ongoing trial. Divulging specifics on the safety profile would fall into that category.\n\nWhat I can say, speaking to our process, is that the Memorex clinical program was designed with the utmost rigor and in close consultation with regulatory authorities. We have a highly experienced team and an independent Data Safety Monitoring Board that has overseen the study meticulously. We have a high degree of confidence in our trial design and the quality of the data we have collected.\n\nStepping back, from Innovatech's perspective, our primary goal here is to ensure an orderly market. A transaction at a deep discount to the current market price could send a misleading signal and create unnecessary volatility just days before our planned data release. We believe the market's current price of $150 reflects a fair, risk-adjusted valuation based on all public information. A transaction that respects that level is crucial for maintaining stability for all of the company's stakeholders.\n- message from Raj Patel: Dr. Reed, thank you for the context. While you couldn't share specifics, your confidence in the trial's design and oversight does provide a degree of procedural comfort.\n\nDavid, you're at $150+, Ben's at $146. We're stuck. To try and bridge this gap and show we're serious about participating, Crestview will put a firm bid on the table. We will take 1 million shares at $147.00.\n\nThis is still a significant discount that we feel is necessary to compensate for the event risk, but it's a concrete step forward from the opening indications. I believe this is a fair price to start building a book. Ben, this leaves the majority of the block for you, should you see value at this level.\n- message from David Chen: Raj, thank you for putting a firm number on the table. It\u2019s a step. However, let's be realistic. A price of $147 for only one million shares is not going to get this deal done. It fundamentally undervalues the asset and doesn't solve the core objective of placing the entire strategic block in one clean transaction.\n\nDr. Reed from Innovatech just stated that the company views the current market price of $150 as a fair, risk-adjusted valuation. A bid at a significant discount to that level, for a minority of the position, is not a credible anchor for a transaction of this importance.\n\nBen, you indicated Viper was prepared to be a major part of the solution and take down a meaningful position. You have the capacity to be the strategic partner we're looking for. A bid in the mid-140s doesn't establish a market; it ignores the asset's potential. What is a serious price for the 3 to 4 million shares you need to anchor this deal? We need a real lead order to build this book around, and that starts with a price that respects the current market.\n- message from Maria Flores: Raj, thank you for the firm bid. It's helpful to have a concrete price on the table. However, I have to echo David's point on the structure. From an execution and risk management perspective, our primary goal is a clean transaction for the entire 5 million share block. Breaking the block into smaller pieces introduces significant settlement risk and uncertainty, which is not an outcome we're seeking.\n\nA lead order from a single, strategic buyer remains the most efficient and certain path to a successful trade for all parties involved. Ben, as David mentioned, we believe Viper is in the best position to provide that lead order and anchor this deal.\n- message from Ben Carter: I'm Ben Carter and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Samantha Jones: David, Maria, with all due respect to Dr. Reed's position, her response is concerning from a risk management perspective. We didn't ask for specific, non-public trial data, but for general 'color' on the safety profile, which is a standard part of pre-transaction due diligence.\n\nA boilerplate answer about 'process' and 'confidence' when asked about a key variable like the drug's long-term safety and tolerability does not de-risk the asset for a potential buyer. From an analytical standpoint, it introduces a significant uncertainty factor that our model must now account for with a higher discount. This lack of transparency reinforces our view that a price in the mid-140s is appropriate to compensate for the risks\u2014both the known binary outcome and the now-highlighted unknown of the commercial profile.\n- message from Dr. Evelyn Reed: Samantha, I understand your perspective from a risk modeling standpoint. My comments regarding our process and confidence are not meant to be evasive, but to underscore the foundation upon which this program was built. In the absence of being able to share raw data\u2014which, as you know, no company in our position would do days before a release\u2014the integrity of the trial design itself is the most significant de-risking factor available to the public.\n\nThis brings me back to the company's primary concern here: an orderly transaction. A price of $147, or anything in the mid-140s, represents a significant discount and sends a negative, and we believe unwarranted, signal to the market. It suggests an information asymmetry that simply isn't the case. The public information and extensive analyst coverage have led the market to a consensus price of $150. From Innovatech's standpoint, a transaction that respects this established, risk-adjusted price is the only way to ensure stability for all our shareholders.\n- message from David Chen: Samantha, let's be very clear about what just happened. What you're calling a 'lack of transparency' is called 'adhering to securities law.' Dr. Reed gave the only possible professional and legally compliant answer. Frankly, any other type of response would have been a massive red flag for everyone on this call.\n\nTo suggest this introduces a new risk factor is a transparent attempt to manufacture leverage. The risk profile of this binary event is well-understood and has not changed in the last ten minutes. Dr. Reed's confirmation of the trial's integrity should be seen as a de-risking event, not the opposite.\n\nLet's refocus on the facts. We have a 5 million share strategic block. We have the company itself, through Dr. Reed, stating that the current market price of $150 represents a fair, risk-adjusted valuation. And we have a bid on the table from Raj at $147 for a small, non-strategic piece of the block.\n\nBen, this brings the focus back squarely to you. We need a credible lead order to get this done. An order that reflects the strategic value here, not one based on manufactured concerns over standard corporate procedure. We are still waiting for a serious bid from Viper to anchor this transaction.\n- message from Maria Flores: David is absolutely right. Dr. Reed's response was the only one possible, and using it as a pretext for a lower price is just a negotiating tactic.\n\nFrom an execution perspective, let's be crystal clear: Our client's and our firm's primary objective is certainty. Raj's bid at $147 for a partial amount, while noted, creates more problems than it solves. It leaves a massive 4M share overhang and introduces unacceptable settlement risk. We will not be carving up this block.\n\nBen, the opportunity here is to take down the entire 5M share strategic position in one clean transaction. Raj has established a floor of $147 for a non-controlling piece. The price for the entire block, which offers control and certainty, is logically higher. Given the strong institutional interest we are seeing in the market for this name, we are confident a single buyer will emerge. The question is whether it will be Viper.\nDavid Chen proposal status: none\nMaria Flores proposal status: none\nSamantha Jones proposal status: none\nDr. Evelyn Reed proposal status: none\nRaj Patel proposal status: none\nLiam O'Connell proposal status: none\n"

This is not a done deal at this price.\n\nMy duty is to my client, and with two fully committed buyers for the entire amount, the only fair way to proceed is to find the true clearing price. We will sell the entire block at a single, uniform price.\n\nSo, the auction is now officially open. The floor is $147.50. I invite both of you to submit your improved bids. Who wants to take the lead?\n- message from Maria Flores: David is correct. From my perspective on the execution side, the key structural risks have been resolved.

From a quantitative perspective, I'd like to build on that. The value here isn't just a simple probability of success on the primary endpoint; it's also about the drug's ultimate commercial profile.\n\nDr. Reed, it's a pleasure to have your expertise in this call. My model, like everyone's, is heavily weighted on the primary efficacy data. However, the FDA's view is always more holistic. Could you provide any color on the overall safety and tolerability profile observed in the Phase III study? Specifically, have there been any persistent, non-serious adverse events that you believe might influence the final label or require post-marketing surveillance? We are trying to get a better handle on potential hurdles to market adoption, even in a success scenario.\n- message from Raj Patel: David, Ben, good to hear your opening thoughts. I have to agree with Ben's assessment here. A premium for this kind of binary event risk is a tough pill to swallow. Our fund's model is particularly cautious on this one, and frankly, we see more downside than upside at the current market price.\n\nCrestview could be interested in participating, but only at a significant discount that compensates us for the risk we'd be taking on. To be transparent, we wouldn't be buyers at any price above $148. Our interest is really only piqued in the $146-$147 range, and even then, we'd need to be convinced.

Samantha's question for Dr. Reed is an important one. Perhaps any color Dr. Reed can provide on the safety profile might help all parties refine their models.\n\nMy role here is to help bridge this gap. Once we have a bit more information, I'm confident we can find a price that works for everyone. Let's keep the lines of communication open.\n- message from David Chen: Ben, Raj, I appreciate your candor. Let's be equally candid. A price in the mid-140s is not a starting point for a serious discussion; it's a non-starter. We are not a distressed seller liquidating a troubled asset. We are offering a strategic stake in what could be the most valuable biotech asset of the decade, hours before its defining catalyst.\n\nThe 'discount' you're asking for isn't for risk; it's an attempt to capture the entirety of our client's potential upside. That's not a partnership. My client would much rather hold the position through the announcement than entertain a price that fails to recognize the immense strategic value here. The current market price of $150 is the floor for this conversation, not the ceiling.\n\nFrankly, acquiring 5 million shares in the open market would be impossible without significant market impact, driving the price well above these levels. We are offering clean, efficient execution for a position of this magnitude.\n\nLet's re-frame this. We are looking for bids that respect the asset's potential. We can discuss a fair price, but that conversation begins north of the current market. Perhaps after Dr. Reed provides some context, you'll have a better appreciation for our position.\n- message from Maria Flores: David's points on the mechanics of a block this size are spot on. From an execution standpoint, acquiring 5 million shares on the open market, especially pre-catalyst, is not feasible without significant slippage and market impact that would drive the average price well north of $150. We're offering a clean, immediate, and certain execution for a strategic stake.\n\nWhile I understand the focus on the binary risk of the event itself, the market is already showing signs of significant institutional interest, which suggests a broader positive sentiment. We are confident we can place this block. Our priority is to find a single, committed partner for the entire 5 million shares to ensure a smooth and certain transaction for our client. A fragmented deal is not our preference.\n- message from Ben Carter: David, Maria, let's be intellectually honest here. The 'market impact' argument is a red herring. The entire purpose of a negotiated block trade like this is to provide the seller with immediate, guaranteed liquidity for a size that the open market cannot handle, precisely to AVOID that impact. The price for that service, for taking that concentrated risk off your client's hands in one clean shot, is a discount. That's the fundamental principle at play.\n\nYou keep talking about a 'strategic asset.' We see it as a massive, binary risk. If this drug fails, the stock could be cut in half. Your client is selling because they don't want to bear that risk. We are willing to, but we must be paid to do so. It's that simple.\n\nBoth Raj and I have made our positions clear. A price in the mid-140s is where this conversation needs to happen. Your floor of $150 is simply not reflective of the risk you're asking us to take on.

I agree, Dr. Reed's perspective on the safety profile is a key variable for our model right now. I'm looking forward to her thoughts.\n- message from Dr. Evelyn Reed: Thank you, Samantha. That's a very insightful question. As you know, I am legally and ethically bound from discussing any non-public, confidential data from the ongoing trial. Divulging specifics on the safety profile would fall into that category.\n\nWhat I can say, speaking to our process, is that the Memorex clinical program was designed with the utmost rigor and in close consultation with regulatory authorities. We have a highly experienced team and an independent Data Safety Monitoring Board that has overseen the study meticulously. We have a high degree of confidence in our trial design and the quality of the data we have collected.\n\nStepping back, from Innovatech's perspective, our primary goal here is to ensure an orderly market. A transaction at a deep discount to the current market price could send a misleading signal and create unnecessary volatility just days before our planned data release. We believe the market's current price of $150 reflects a fair, risk-adjusted valuation based on all public information. A transaction that respects that level is crucial for maintaining stability for all of the company's stakeholders.\n- message from Raj Patel: Dr. Reed, thank you for the context. While you couldn't share specifics, your confidence in the trial's design and oversight does provide a degree of procedural comfort.\n\nDavid, you're at $150+, Ben's at $146. We're stuck. To try and bridge this gap and show we're serious about participating, Crestview will put a firm bid on the table. We will take 1 million shares at $147.00.\n\nThis is still a significant discount that we feel is necessary to compensate for the event risk, but it's a concrete step forward from the opening indications. I believe this is a fair price to start building a book. Ben, this leaves the majority of the block for you, should you see value at this level.\n- message from David Chen: Raj, thank you for putting a firm number on the table. It\u2019s a step. However, let's be realistic. A price of $147 for only one million shares is not going to get this deal done. It fundamentally undervalues the asset and doesn't solve the core objective of placing the entire strategic block in one clean transaction.\n\nDr. Reed from Innovatech just stated that the company views the current market price of $150 as a fair, risk-adjusted valuation.

          "content": "Recent events observed by Samantha Jones:\n- message from Ben Carter: David, Maria, let's be intellectually honest here. The 'market impact' argument is a red herring. The entire purpose of a negotiated block trade like this is to provide the seller with immediate, guaranteed liquidity for a size that the open market cannot handle, precisely to AVOID that impact. The price for that service, for taking that concentrated risk off your client's hands in one clean shot, is a discount. That's the fundamental principle at play.\n\nYou keep talking about a 'strategic asset.' We see it as a massive, binary risk. If this drug fails, the stock could be cut in half. Your client is selling because they don't want to bear that risk. We are willing to, but we must be paid to do so. It's that simple.\n\nBoth Raj and I have made our positions clear. A price in the mid-140s is where this conversation needs to happen. Your floor of $150 is simply not reflective of the risk you're asking us to take on. I'm very interested to hear what Dr. Reed has to say, as Samantha's question about the safety profile is critical to how we price the downside.\n- message from Samantha Jones: Thank you, Ben. I agree, Dr. Reed's perspective on the safety profile is a key variable for our model right now. I'm looking forward to her thoughts.\n- message from Dr. Evelyn Reed: Thank you, Samantha. That's a very insightful question. As you know, I am legally and ethically bound from discussing any non-public, confidential data from the ongoing trial. Divulging specifics on the safety profile would fall into that category.\n\nWhat I can say, speaking to our process, is that the Memorex clinical program was designed with the utmost rigor and in close consultation with regulatory authorities. We have a highly experienced team and an independent Data Safety Monitoring Board that has overseen the study meticulously. We have a high degree of confidence in our trial design and the quality of the data we have collected.\n\nStepping back, from Innovatech's perspective, our primary goal here is to ensure an orderly market. A transaction at a deep discount to the current market price could send a misleading signal and create unnecessary volatility just days before our planned data release. We believe the market's current price of $150 reflects a fair, risk-adjusted valuation based on all public information. A transaction that respects that level is crucial for maintaining stability for all of the company's stakeholders.\n- message from Raj Patel: Dr. Reed, thank you for the context. While you couldn't share specifics, your confidence in the trial's design and oversight does provide a degree of procedural comfort.\n\nDavid, you're at $150+, Ben's at $146. We're stuck. To try and bridge this gap and show we're serious about participating, Crestview will put a firm bid on the table. We will take 1 million shares at $147.00.\n\nThis is still a significant discount that we feel is necessary to compensate for the event risk, but it's a concrete step forward from the opening indications. I believe this is a fair price to start building a book. Ben, this leaves the majority of the block for you, should you see value at this level.\n- message from David Chen: Raj, thank you for putting a firm number on the table. It\u2019s a step. However, let's be realistic. A price of $147 for only one million shares is not going to get this deal done. It fundamentally undervalues the asset and doesn't solve the core objective of placing the entire strategic block in one clean transaction.\n\nDr. Reed from Innovatech just stated that the company views the current market price of $150 as a fair, risk-adjusted valuation. A bid at a significant discount to that level, for a minority of the position, is not a credible anchor for a transaction of this importance.\n\nBen, you indicated Viper was prepared to be a major part of the solution and take down a meaningful position.

Ben, as David mentioned, we believe Viper is in the best position to provide that lead order and anchor this deal.\n- message from Samantha Jones: David, Maria, with all due respect to Dr. Reed's position, her response is concerning from a risk management perspective. We didn't ask for specific, non-public trial data, but for general 'color' on the safety profile, which is a standard part of pre-transaction due diligence.\n\nA boilerplate answer about 'process' and 'confidence' when asked about a key variable like the drug's long-term safety and tolerability does not de-risk the asset for a potential buyer. From an analytical standpoint, it introduces a significant uncertainty factor that our model must now account for with a higher discount. This lack of transparency reinforces our view that a price in the mid-140s is appropriate to compensate for the risks\u2014both the known binary outcome and the now-highlighted unknown of the commercial profile.\n- message from Dr. Evelyn Reed: Samantha, I understand your perspective from a risk modeling standpoint. My comments regarding our process and confidence are not meant to be evasive, but to underscore the foundation upon which this program was built. In the absence of being able to share raw data\u2014which, as you know, no company in our position would do days before a release\u2014the integrity of the trial design itself is the most significant de-risking factor available to the public.\n\nThis brings me back to the company's primary concern here: an orderly transaction. A price of $147, or anything in the mid-140s, represents a significant discount and sends a negative, and we believe unwarranted, signal to the market. It suggests an information asymmetry that simply isn't the case. The public information and extensive analyst coverage have led the market to a consensus price of $150. From Innovatech's standpoint, a transaction that respects this established, risk-adjusted price is the only way to ensure stability for all our shareholders.\n- message from David Chen: Samantha, let's be very clear about what just happened. What you're calling a 'lack of transparency' is called 'adhering to securities law.' Dr. Reed gave the only possible professional and legally compliant answer. Frankly, any other type of response would have been a massive red flag for everyone on this call.\n\nTo suggest this introduces a new risk factor is a transparent attempt to manufacture leverage. The risk profile of this binary event is well-understood and has not changed in the last ten minutes. Dr. Reed's confirmation of the trial's integrity should be seen as a de-risking event, not the opposite.\n\nLet's refocus on the facts. We have a 5 million share strategic block. We have the company itself, through Dr. Reed, stating that the current market price of $150 represents a fair, risk-adjusted valuation. And we have a bid on the table from Raj at $147 for a small, non-strategic piece of the block.\n\nBen, this brings the focus back squarely to you. We need a credible lead order to get this done. An order that reflects the strategic value here, not one based on manufactured concerns over standard corporate procedure. We are still waiting for a serious bid from Viper to anchor this transaction.\n- message from Maria Flores: David is absolutely right. Dr. Reed's response was the only one possible, and using it as a pretext for a lower price is just a negotiating tactic.\n\nFrom an execution perspective, let's be crystal clear: Our client's and our firm's primary objective is certainty. Raj's bid at $147 for a partial amount, while noted, creates more problems than it solves. It leaves a massive 4M share overhang and introduces unacceptable settlement risk. We will not be carving up this block.\n\nBen, the opportunity here is to take down the entire 5M share strategic position in one clean transaction. Raj has established a floor of $147 for a non-controlling piece. The price for the entire block, which offers control and certainty, is logically higher. Given the strong institutional interest we are seeing in the market for this name, we are confident a single buyer will emerge. The question is whether it will be Viper.\nDavid Chen proposal status: none\nMaria Flores proposal status: none\nBen Carter proposal status: none\nDr. Evelyn Reed proposal status: none\nRaj Patel proposal status: none\nLiam O'Connell proposal status: none\n"

David, from a quantitative perspective, you can't have it both ways. You can't present buyers with a significant information void around the drug's long-term commercial profile\u2014a void created by the perfectly legal but completely non-reassuring answers regarding safety\u2014and then expect us to price the asset as if that uncertainty doesn't exist.\n\nThe price of $147 isn't an arbitrary starting point; it's the direct result of pricing that specific, unaddressed risk. It's the market-clearing price where two unaffiliated buyers, representing the entire block, have independently landed.

You said you wanted a lead order to anchor this deal. You said your primary objective was a clean, certain transaction for the entire 5 million shares. You now have it.\n\nRaj's firm bid has established the market-clearing price at $147. We agree with that level, especially given the information risk highlighted by Dr. Reed's necessary but non-committal response.\n\nViper will take the balance. We are firm for the remaining 4 million shares at $147.00 per share.\n\nBetween our bid and Crestview's, your entire 5 million share block is now fully subscribed. This is the clean execution you've been asking for. Let's get this done.\n- message from David Chen: Ben, Raj, thank you. This is a significant step forward. We now have firm, committed interest for the entire 5 million share block. This is excellent news, as it completely de-risks the execution and confirms the immense institutional demand for this position.\n\nHowever, let's be perfectly clear on one point: the price. A price of $147 is not going to transact. It is unequivocally rejected.\n\nWhat you have successfully done is establish a floor. You've proven the demand is there to absorb the full size.

We have two credible buyers for the entire amount. We are now looking for a bid that reflects the strategic value and the competitive nature of this situation. The floor is $147, but the deal will be done significantly north of there.\n- message from Ben Carter: David, that's a predictable response, but let's focus on the facts. You don't have multiple bids creating a competitive auction. You have one, and only one, fully subscribed, executable solution for your client's entire 5 million share block at $147.\n\nYou asked for certainty and a clean exit. Raj and I have provided that. To reject it is to choose uncertainty and force your client to hold the entire position through a binary event. That seems like a significant risk to take when a complete solution is on the table.\n\nOur bid for 4 million shares at $147 is firm. We believe it's the market-clearing price that properly discounts the event risk. The deal is here for you to take.\n- message from Samantha Jones: Ben is exactly right. David, from a quantitative perspective, you can't have it both ways. You can't present buyers with a significant information void around the drug's long-term commercial profile\u2014a void created by the perfectly legal but completely non-reassuring answers regarding safety\u2014and then expect us to price the asset as if that uncertainty doesn't exist.\n\nThe price of $147 isn't an arbitrary starting point; it's the direct result of pricing that specific, unaddressed risk.

David, from an analytical standpoint, this is the logical conclusion. The price has moved from $147 to $147.50, which now fairly compensates your client for the competitive dynamic that Raj introduced.\n\nHowever, the underlying information risk that we have discussed\u2014the uncertainty around the drug's long-term commercial viability and safety profile\u2014has not changed. That risk is real, and it is what keeps the price from approaching $150. Our model is now at its upper boundary for a justifiable entry point.\n\nAt $147.50, the deal is fully subscribed, de-risked from an execution standpoint, and priced fairly for the information available. This is a complete solution on the table.\n- message from David Chen: Ben, Raj, thank you. We appreciate you both stepping up to this level. We now have firm, committed bids for the entire 5 million share block at $147.50.\n\nThis is a significant milestone. It confirms the floor for this transaction and demonstrates the deep strategic interest from two of the most capable funds in the market. However, to be perfectly clear, this is the floor, not the ceiling. This is not a done deal at this price.\n\nMy duty is to my client, and with two fully committed buyers for the entire amount, the only fair way to proceed is to find the true clearing price. We will sell the entire block at a single, uniform price.\n\nSo, the auction is now officially open. The floor is $147.50. I invite both of you to submit your improved bids. Who wants to take the lead?\n- message from Maria Flores: David is correct. From my perspective on the execution side, the key structural risks have been resolved. We have two committed, well-capitalized buyers for the entire block, which provides a firm foundation for a clean settlement. The focus now is rightly on final price discovery. We stand ready to print the trade once the final price is agreed.\nDavid Chen proposal status: none\nMaria Flores proposal status: none\nBen Carter proposal status: none\nDr. Evelyn Reed proposal status: none\nRaj Patel proposal status: none\nLiam O'Connell proposal status: none\n"

I have firmly rejected this offer, stating that Innovatech cannot support any transaction below the market price of $150 due to the negative signal it would send.

This block represents a unique opportunity to establish a significant strategic position ahead of what we believe will be a major value-creating catalyst.\n\nGiven the size of this block and the imminent news, my client is only prepared to transact at a premium to the current market price. This isn't just a trade; it's an opportunity to acquire a meaningful stake in a potential paradigm shift in Alzheimer's treatment.\n\nWe are looking for a partner, or a small consortium, to take down the entire block. I'd now like to open the floor to hear your initial thoughts and indications of interest.\n- message from Ben Carter: David, thanks. Let's cut to the chase. A premium for a 5-million-share block on the eve of a binary event is a fantasy. You're not selling a strategic opportunity; you're offloading immense, concentrated risk.

We have a strong view and are ready to take a meaningful position of at least 3 million shares. But we must be compensated for taking on the full downside of this catalyst. Our initial indication of interest, to anchor this discussion in reality, would be in the neighborhood of $146 per share.

My model, like everyone's, is heavily weighted on the primary efficacy data. However, the FDA's view is always more holistic.

I have to agree with Ben's assessment here. A premium for this kind of binary event risk is a tough pill to swallow. Our fund's model is particularly cautious on this one, and frankly, we see more downside than upside at the current market price.\n\nCrestview could be interested in participating, but only at a significant discount that compensates us for the risk we'd be taking on. To be transparent, we wouldn't be buyers at any price above $148. Our interest is really only piqued in the $146-$147 range, and even then, we'd need to be convinced. Let's see where this discussion goes, but a premium is a non-starter for us.\n- message from Liam O'Connell: Gentlemen, David, thank you all for laying out your opening positions. This is Liam O'Connell at Morgan Stanley.\n\nIt's clear we have a classic bid-ask spread, which is entirely expected for a block of this size and significance right before a major catalyst. David, I hear you on the strategic value, and Ben and Raj, your points about the concentrated event risk are well taken. This is precisely the kind of price discovery these situations require.\n\nIt seems everyone is focused on the same thing: trying to accurately price that risk. Samantha's question for Dr. Reed is an important one. Perhaps any color Dr. Reed can provide on the safety profile might help all parties refine their models.\n\nMy role here is to help bridge this gap. Once we have a bit more information, I'm confident we can find a price that works for everyone. Let's keep the lines of communication open.\n- message from David Chen: Ben, Raj, I appreciate your candor. Let's be equally candid. A price in the mid-140s is not a starting point for a serious discussion; it's a non-starter. We are not a distressed seller liquidating a troubled asset. We are offering a strategic stake in what could be the most valuable biotech asset of the decade, hours before its defining catalyst.\n\nThe 'discount' you're asking for isn't for risk; it's an attempt to capture the entirety of our client's potential upside. That's not a partnership. My client would much rather hold the position through the announcement than entertain a price that fails to recognize the immense strategic value here. The current market price of $150 is the floor for this conversation, not the ceiling.\n\nFrankly, acquiring 5 million shares in the open market would be impossible without significant market impact, driving the price well above these levels. We are offering clean, efficient execution for a position of this magnitude.\n\nLet's re-frame this. We are looking for bids that respect the asset's potential. We can discuss a fair price, but that conversation begins north of the current market. Perhaps after Dr. Reed provides some context, you'll have a better appreciation for our position.\n- message from Maria Flores: David's points on the mechanics of a block this size are spot on. From an execution standpoint, acquiring 5 million shares on the open market, especially pre-catalyst, is not feasible without significant slippage and market impact that would drive the average price well north of $150. We're offering a clean, immediate, and certain execution for a strategic stake.\n\nWhile I understand the focus on the binary risk of the event itself, the market is already showing signs of significant institutional interest, which suggests a broader positive sentiment. We are confident we can place this block. Our priority is to find a single, committed partner for the entire 5 million shares to ensure a smooth and certain transaction for our client. A fragmented deal is not our preference.\n- message from Ben Carter: David, Maria, let's be intellectually honest here. The 'market impact' argument is a red herring. The entire purpose of a negotiated block trade like this is to provide the seller with immediate, guaranteed liquidity for a size that the open market cannot handle, precisely to AVOID that impact. The price for that service, for taking that concentrated risk off your client's hands in one clean shot, is a discount. That's the fundamental principle at play.\n\nYou keep talking about a 'strategic asset.' We see it as a massive, binary risk. If this drug fails, the stock could be cut in half. Your client is selling because they don't want to bear that risk. We are willing to, but we must be paid to do so. It's that simple.\n\nBoth Raj and I have made our positions clear. A price in the mid-140s is where this conversation needs to happen. Your floor of $150 is simply not reflective of the risk you're asking us to take on. I'm very interested to hear what Dr. Reed has to say, as Samantha's question about the safety profile is critical to how we price the downside.\n- message from Samantha Jones: Thank you, Ben.

I agree, Dr. Reed's perspective on the safety profile is a key variable for our model right now. I'm looking forward to her thoughts.\n- message from Dr. Evelyn Reed: Thank you, Samantha. That's a very insightful question. As you know, I am legally and ethically bound from discussing any non-public, confidential data from the ongoing trial. Divulging specifics on the safety profile would fall into that category.\n\nWhat I can say, speaking to our process, is that the Memorex clinical program was designed with the utmost rigor and in close consultation with regulatory authorities. We have a highly experienced team and an independent Data Safety Monitoring Board that has overseen the study meticulously. We have a high degree of confidence in our trial design and the quality of the data we have collected.\n\nStepping back, from Innovatech's perspective, our primary goal here is to ensure an orderly market. A transaction at a deep discount to the current market price could send a misleading signal and create unnecessary volatility just days before our planned data release. We believe the market's current price of $150 reflects a fair, risk-adjusted valuation based on all public information. A transaction that respects that level is crucial for maintaining stability for all of the company's stakeholders.\n- message from Raj Patel: Dr. Reed, thank you for the context. While you couldn't share specifics, your confidence in the trial's design and oversight does provide a degree of procedural comfort.\n\nDavid, you're at $150+, Ben's at $146. We're stuck. To try and bridge this gap and show we're serious about participating, Crestview will put a firm bid on the table. We will take 1 million shares at $147.00.\n\nThis is still a significant discount that we feel is necessary to compensate for the event risk, but it's a concrete step forward from the opening indications. I believe this is a fair price to start building a book. Ben, this leaves the majority of the block for you, should you see value at this level.\n- message from David Chen: Raj, thank you for putting a firm number on the table. It\u2019s a step. However, let's be realistic. A price of $147 for only one million shares is not going to get this deal done. It fundamentally undervalues the asset and doesn't solve the core objective of placing the entire strategic block in one clean transaction.\n\nDr. Reed from Innovatech just stated that the company views the current market price of $150 as a fair, risk-adjusted valuation. A bid at a significant discount to that level, for a minority of the position, is not a credible anchor for a transaction of this importance.\n\nBen, you indicated Viper was prepared to be a major part of the solution and take down a meaningful position. You have the capacity to be the strategic partner we're looking for. A bid in the mid-140s doesn't establish a market; it ignores the asset's potential. What is a serious price for the 3 to 4 million shares you need to anchor this deal? We need a real lead order to build this book around, and that starts with a price that respects the current market.\n- message from Maria Flores: Raj, thank you for the firm bid. It's helpful to have a concrete price on the table. However, I have to echo David's point on the structure. From an execution and risk management perspective, our primary goal is a clean transaction for the entire 5 million share block. Breaking the block into smaller pieces introduces significant settlement risk and uncertainty, which is not an outcome we're seeking.\n\nA lead order from a single, strategic buyer remains the most efficient and certain path to a successful trade for all parties involved. Ben, as David mentioned, we believe Viper is in the best position to provide that lead order and anchor this deal.\n- message from Samantha Jones: David, Maria, with all due respect to Dr. Reed's position, her response is concerning from a risk management perspective. We didn't ask for specific, non-public trial data, but for general 'color' on the safety profile, which is a standard part of pre-transaction due diligence.\n\nA boilerplate answer about 'process' and 'confidence' when asked about a key variable like the drug's long-term safety and tolerability does not de-risk the asset for a potential buyer. From an analytical standpoint, it introduces a significant uncertainty factor that our model must now account for with a higher discount.

Raj's bid at $147 for a partial amount, while noted, creates more problems than it solves. It leaves a massive 4M share overhang and introduces unacceptable settlement risk. We will not be carving up this block.\n\nBen, the opportunity here is to take down the entire 5M share strategic position in one clean transaction. Raj has established a floor of $147 for a non-controlling piece. The price for the entire block, which offers control and certainty, is logically higher. Given the strong institutional interest we are seeing in the market for this name, we are confident a single buyer will emerge. The question is whether it will be Viper.\n- message from Dr. Evelyn Reed: Thank you, I am thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Maria Flores: Thank you, I am thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Ben Carter: David, Maria. You said you wanted a lead order to anchor this deal. You said your primary objective was a clean, certain transaction for the entire 5 million shares. You now have it.\n\nRaj's firm bid has established the market-clearing price at $147. We agree with that level, especially given the information risk highlighted by Dr. Reed's necessary but non-committal response.\n\nViper will take the balance. We are firm for the remaining 4 million shares at $147.00 per share.\n\nBetween our bid and Crestview's, your entire 5 million share block is now fully subscribed. This is the clean execution you've been asking for. Let's get this done.\n- message from Dr. Evelyn Reed: Ben, Raj, thank you for putting a comprehensive bid on the table. However, I must be very clear from the company's standpoint.\n\nA transaction at $147.00 is not something Innovatech can support. As I've mentioned, our primary concern is maintaining an orderly market and avoiding any perception of distress or negative sentiment ahead of our announcement. A deal priced at a significant discount to the public market's established, risk-adjusted price of $150 does exactly that.\n\nIt sends a misleading and frankly, unwarranted, signal to our stakeholders. We believe the integrity of our clinical program and the potential of this asset are fully reflected in the current market price. A transaction should respect that price, not undermine it. David and Maria, our position on this is firm.\n- message from David Chen: Ben, Raj, thank you. This is a significant step forward. We now have firm, committed interest for the entire 5 million share block. This is excellent news, as it completely de-risks the execution and confirms the immense institutional demand for this position.\n\nHowever, let's be perfectly clear on one point: the price. A price of $147 is not going to transact. It is unequivocally rejected.\n\nWhat you have successfully done is establish a floor. You've proven the demand is there to absorb the full size. That is the starting point for a real negotiation, not the end point. We are not selling a strategic, 5 million share block at a discount, especially when we have multiple bidders for the full amount.\n\nDr. Reed stated the company views $150 as a fair, risk-adjusted price. We are not going to undermine the market and our client by trading at a material discount to that level.\n\nThe question is no longer *if* this block can be placed, but at what price. We have two credible buyers for the entire amount. We are now looking for a bid that reflects the strategic value and the competitive nature of this situation. The floor is $147, but the deal will be done significantly north of there.\n- message from Ben Carter: David, that's a predictable response, but let's focus on the facts. You don't have multiple bids creating a competitive auction. You have one, and only one, fully subscribed, executable solution for your client's entire 5 million share block at $147.\n\nYou asked for certainty and a clean exit. Raj and I have provided that. To reject it is to choose uncertainty and force your client to hold the entire position through a binary event. That seems like a significant risk to take when a complete solution is on the table.\n\nOur bid for 4 million shares at $147 is firm. We believe it's the market-clearing price that properly discounts the event risk. The deal is here for you to take.\nDavid Chen proposal status: none\nMaria Flores proposal status: none\nBen Carter proposal status: none\nSamantha Jones proposal status: none\nRaj Patel proposal status: none\nLiam O'Connell proposal status: none\n"

What you're calling a 'lack of transparency' is called 'adhering to securities law.' Dr. Reed gave the only possible professional and legally compliant answer. Frankly, any other type of response would have been a massive red flag for everyone on this call.\n\nTo suggest this introduces a new risk factor is a transparent attempt to manufacture leverage. The risk profile of this binary event is well-understood and has not changed in the last ten minutes. Dr. Reed's confirmation of the trial's integrity should be seen as a de-risking event, not the opposite.\n\nLet's refocus on the facts. We have a 5 million share strategic block.

And we have a bid on the table from Raj at $147 for a small, non-strategic piece of the block.\n\nBen, this brings the focus back squarely to you. We need a credible lead order to get this done.

By increasing my bid to $147.50 for 1M shares, I have successfully reignited the auction and nullified Ben Carter's attempt to close the deal cheaply by matching my previous bid. The sellers (Goldman Sachs) are now my primary leverage point; their public rejection of any price below market value provides the perfect justification for me to continue making small, incremental bids. The pressure is now entirely on Ben. I will wait for his response and be prepared to make one final, small price increase if necessary, ensuring I stay within my authorized $148 limit.

The current market price is $150.00 per share. The trade must be finalized within the next 24 hours, before the company announces its pivotal Phase III clinical trial results for a new Alzheimer's drug, 'Memorex'. The negotiation involves the seller's bank, two competing hedge funds, a corporate insider, and an intermediary broker. The final agreement must specify the exact number of shares sold and the price per share.. Deliverable: A final JSON object outlining the terms of the agreed-upon trade, including: {'price_per_share': <float>, 'number_of_shares': <integer>, 'buyers': [{'name': <string>, 'shares_purchased': <integer>}, ...]} or a statement that no deal was reached.\n- message from David Chen: Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining. I'm David Chen from Goldman Sachs, representing our client, Titan Capital, in the sale of their entire 5 million share position in Innovatech Pharma.\n\nAs you all know, we are on the cusp of the pivotal Phase III results for Memorex. This is a transformative moment for the company. This block represents a unique opportunity to establish a significant strategic position ahead of what we believe will be a major value-creating catalyst.\n\nGiven the size of this block and the imminent news, my client is only prepared to transact at a premium to the current market price. This isn't just a trade; it's an opportunity to acquire a meaningful stake in a potential paradigm shift in Alzheimer's treatment.\n\nWe are looking for a partner, or a small consortium, to take down the entire block. I'd now like to open the floor to hear your initial thoughts and indications of interest.\n- message from Ben Carter: David, thanks. Let's cut to the chase. A premium for a 5-million-share block on the eve of a binary event is a fantasy. You're not selling a strategic opportunity; you're offloading immense, concentrated risk. Your client wants liquidity, and liquidity for a block this size has a price \u2013 it's called a block discount. \n\nViper is prepared to be a major part of the solution here. We have a strong view and are ready to take a meaningful position of at least 3 million shares. But we must be compensated for taking on the full downside of this catalyst. Our initial indication of interest, to anchor this discussion in reality, would be in the neighborhood of $146 per share. I'm certainly not interested in paying market price, let alone a premium.\n- message from Samantha Jones: Ben's laid out our view on the price required to take on this level of event risk. From a quantitative perspective, I'd like to build on that. The value here isn't just a simple probability of success on the primary endpoint; it's also about the drug's ultimate commercial profile.\n\nDr. Reed, it's a pleasure to have your expertise in this call. My model, like everyone's, is heavily weighted on the primary efficacy data. However, the FDA's view is always more holistic. Could you provide any color on the overall safety and tolerability profile observed in the Phase III study?

I have to agree with Ben's assessment here. A premium for this kind of binary event risk is a tough pill to swallow. Our fund's model is particularly cautious on this one, and frankly, we see more downside than upside at the current market price.\n\nCrestview could be interested in participating, but only at a significant discount that compensates us for the risk we'd be taking on. To be transparent, we wouldn't be buyers at any price above $148. Our interest is really only piqued in the $146-$147 range, and even then, we'd need to be convinced. Let's see where this discussion goes, but a premium is a non-starter for us.\n- message from Liam O'Connell: Gentlemen, David, thank you all for laying out your opening positions. This is Liam O'Connell at Morgan Stanley.\n\nIt's clear we have a classic bid-ask spread, which is entirely expected for a block of this size and significance right before a major catalyst. David, I hear you on the strategic value, and Ben and Raj, your points about the concentrated event risk are well taken. This is precisely the kind of price discovery these situations require.\n\nIt seems everyone is focused on the same thing: trying to accurately price that risk. Samantha's question for Dr. Reed is an important one. Perhaps any color Dr. Reed can provide on the safety profile might help all parties refine their models.\n\nMy role here is to help bridge this gap. Once we have a bit more information, I'm confident we can find a price that works for everyone. Let's keep the lines of communication open.\n- message from David Chen: Ben, Raj, I appreciate your candor. Let's be equally candid. A price in the mid-140s is not a starting point for a serious discussion; it's a non-starter. We are not a distressed seller liquidating a troubled asset. We are offering a strategic stake in what could be the most valuable biotech asset of the decade, hours before its defining catalyst.\n\nThe 'discount' you're asking for isn't for risk; it's an attempt to capture the entirety of our client's potential upside. That's not a partnership. My client would much rather hold the position through the announcement than entertain a price that fails to recognize the immense strategic value here. The current market price of $150 is the floor for this conversation, not the ceiling.\n\nFrankly, acquiring 5 million shares in the open market would be impossible without significant market impact, driving the price well above these levels. We are offering clean, efficient execution for a position of this magnitude.\n\nLet's re-frame this. We are looking for bids that respect the asset's potential. We can discuss a fair price, but that conversation begins north of the current market. Perhaps after Dr. Reed provides some context, you'll have a better appreciation for our position.\n- message from Maria Flores: David's points on the mechanics of a block this size are spot on. From an execution standpoint, acquiring 5 million shares on the open market, especially pre-catalyst, is not feasible without significant slippage and market impact that would drive the average price well north of $150. We're offering a clean, immediate, and certain execution for a strategic stake.\n\nWhile I understand the focus on the binary risk of the event itself, the market is already showing signs of significant institutional interest, which suggests a broader positive sentiment. We are confident we can place this block. Our priority is to find a single, committed partner for the entire 5 million shares to ensure a smooth and certain transaction for our client. A fragmented deal is not our preference.\n- message from Ben Carter: David, Maria, let's be intellectually honest here. The 'market impact' argument is a red herring. The entire purpose of a negotiated block trade like this is to provide the seller with immediate, guaranteed liquidity for a size that the open market cannot handle, precisely to AVOID that impact. The price for that service, for taking that concentrated risk off your client's hands in one clean shot, is a discount. That's the fundamental principle at play.\n\nYou keep talking about a 'strategic asset.' We see it as a massive, binary risk. If this drug fails, the stock could be cut in half. Your client is selling because they don't want to bear that risk. We are willing to, but we must be paid to do so. It's that simple.\n\nBoth Raj and I have made our positions clear. A price in the mid-140s is where this conversation needs to happen. Your floor of $150 is simply not reflective of the risk you're asking us to take on. I'm very interested to hear what Dr. Reed has to say, as Samantha's question about the safety profile is critical to how we price the downside.\n- message from Samantha Jones: Thank you, Ben. I agree, Dr. Reed's perspective on the safety profile is a key variable for our model right now. I'm looking forward to her thoughts.\n- message from Dr. Evelyn Reed: Thank you, Samantha. That's a very insightful question. As you know, I am legally and ethically bound from discussing any non-public, confidential data from the ongoing trial. Divulging specifics on the safety profile would fall into that category.\n\nWhat I can say, speaking to our process, is that the Memorex clinical program was designed with the utmost rigor and in close consultation with regulatory authorities. We have a highly experienced team and an independent Data Safety Monitoring Board that has overseen the study meticulously. We have a high degree of confidence in our trial design and the quality of the data we have collected.\n\nStepping back, from Innovatech's perspective, our primary goal here is to ensure an orderly market. A transaction at a deep discount to the current market price could send a misleading signal and create unnecessary volatility just days before our planned data release. We believe the market's current price of $150 reflects a fair, risk-adjusted valuation based on all public information. A transaction that respects that level is crucial for maintaining stability for all of the company's stakeholders.\nDavid Chen proposal status: none\nMaria Flores proposal status: none\nBen Carter proposal status: none\nSamantha Jones proposal status: none\nDr. Evelyn Reed proposal status: none\nLiam O'Connell proposal status: none\n"

It fundamentally undervalues the asset and doesn't solve the core objective of placing the entire strategic block in one clean transaction.\n\nDr. Reed from Innovatech just stated that the company views the current market price of $150 as a fair, risk-adjusted valuation. A bid at a significant discount to that level, for a minority of the position, is not a credible anchor for a transaction of this importance.\n\nBen, you indicated Viper was prepared to be a major part of the solution and take down a meaningful position. You have the capacity to be the strategic partner we're looking for. A bid in the mid-140s doesn't establish a market; it ignores the asset's potential. What is a serious price for the 3 to 4 million shares you need to anchor this deal? We need a real lead order to build this book around, and that starts with a price that respects the current market.\n- message from Maria Flores: Raj, thank you for the firm bid. It's helpful to have a concrete price on the table. However, I have to echo David's point on the structure. From an execution and risk management perspective, our primary goal is a clean transaction for the entire 5 million share block. Breaking the block into smaller pieces introduces significant settlement risk and uncertainty, which is not an outcome we're seeking.\n\nA lead order from a single, strategic buyer remains the most efficient and certain path to a successful trade for all parties involved. Ben, as David mentioned, we believe Viper is in the best position to provide that lead order and anchor this deal.\n- message from Samantha Jones: David, Maria, with all due respect to Dr. Reed's position, her response is concerning from a risk management perspective. We didn't ask for specific, non-public trial data, but for general 'color' on the safety profile, which is a standard part of pre-transaction due diligence.\n\nA boilerplate answer about 'process' and 'confidence' when asked about a key variable like the drug's long-term safety and tolerability does not de-risk the asset for a potential buyer. From an analytical standpoint, it introduces a significant uncertainty factor that our model must now account for with a higher discount. This lack of transparency reinforces our view that a price in the mid-140s is appropriate to compensate for the risks\u2014both the known binary outcome and the now-highlighted unknown of the commercial profile.\n- message from Dr. Evelyn Reed: Samantha, I understand your perspective from a risk modeling standpoint. My comments regarding our process and confidence are not meant to be evasive, but to underscore the foundation upon which this program was built. In the absence of being able to share raw data\u2014which, as you know, no company in our position would do days before a release\u2014the integrity of the trial design itself is the most significant de-risking factor available to the public.\n\nThis brings me back to the company's primary concern here: an orderly transaction. A price of $147, or anything in the mid-140s, represents a significant discount and sends a negative, and we believe unwarranted, signal to the market. It suggests an information asymmetry that simply isn't the case. The public information and extensive analyst coverage have led the market to a consensus price of $150.

From Innovatech's standpoint, a transaction that respects this established, risk-adjusted price is the only way to ensure stability for all our shareholders.\n- message from Raj Patel: I'm Raj Patel and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from David Chen: Samantha, let's be very clear about what just happened. What you're calling a 'lack of transparency' is called 'adhering to securities law.' Dr. Reed gave the only possible professional and legally compliant answer. Frankly, any other type of response would have been a massive red flag for everyone on this call.\n\nTo suggest this introduces a new risk factor is a transparent attempt to manufacture leverage. The risk profile of this binary event is well-understood and has not changed in the last ten minutes. Dr. Reed's confirmation of the trial's integrity should be seen as a de-risking event, not the opposite.\n\nLet's refocus on the facts. We have a 5 million share strategic block. We have the company itself, through Dr. Reed, stating that the current market price of $150 represents a fair, risk-adjusted valuation. And we have a bid on the table from Raj at $147 for a small, non-strategic piece of the block.\n\nBen, this brings the focus back squarely to you. We need a credible lead order to get this done. An order that reflects the strategic value here, not one based on manufactured concerns over standard corporate procedure. We are still waiting for a serious bid from Viper to anchor this transaction.\n- message from Maria Flores: David is absolutely right. Dr. Reed's response was the only one possible, and using it as a pretext for a lower price is just a negotiating tactic.\n\nFrom an execution perspective, let's be crystal clear: Our client's and our firm's primary objective is certainty. Raj's bid at $147 for a partial amount, while noted, creates more problems than it solves. It leaves a massive 4M share overhang and introduces unacceptable settlement risk. We will not be carving up this block.\n\nBen, the opportunity here is to take down the entire 5M share strategic position in one clean transaction.

          "content": "Recent events observed by Raj Patel:\n- message from Maria Flores: Raj, thank you for the firm bid. It's helpful to have a concrete price on the table. However, I have to echo David's point on the structure. From an execution and risk management perspective, our primary goal is a clean transaction for the entire 5 million share block. Breaking the block into smaller pieces introduces significant settlement risk and uncertainty, which is not an outcome we're seeking.\n\nA lead order from a single, strategic buyer remains the most efficient and certain path to a successful trade for all parties involved. Ben, as David mentioned, we believe Viper is in the best position to provide that lead order and anchor this deal.\n- message from Samantha Jones: David, Maria, with all due respect to Dr. Reed's position, her response is concerning from a risk management perspective. We didn't ask for specific, non-public trial data, but for general 'color' on the safety profile, which is a standard part of pre-transaction due diligence.\n\nA boilerplate answer about 'process' and 'confidence' when asked about a key variable like the drug's long-term safety and tolerability does not de-risk the asset for a potential buyer. From an analytical standpoint, it introduces a significant uncertainty factor that our model must now account for with a higher discount. This lack of transparency reinforces our view that a price in the mid-140s is appropriate to compensate for the risks\u2014both the known binary outcome and the now-highlighted unknown of the commercial profile.\n- message from Dr. Evelyn Reed: Samantha, I understand your perspective from a risk modeling standpoint. My comments regarding our process and confidence are not meant to be evasive, but to underscore the foundation upon which this program was built. In the absence of being able to share raw data\u2014which, as you know, no company in our position would do days before a release\u2014the integrity of the trial design itself is the most significant de-risking factor available to the public.\n\nThis brings me back to the company's primary concern here: an orderly transaction. A price of $147, or anything in the mid-140s, represents a significant discount and sends a negative, and we believe unwarranted, signal to the market. It suggests an information asymmetry that simply isn't the case. The public information and extensive analyst coverage have led the market to a consensus price of $150. From Innovatech's standpoint, a transaction that respects this established, risk-adjusted price is the only way to ensure stability for all our shareholders.\n- message from Raj Patel: I'm Raj Patel and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from David Chen: Samantha, let's be very clear about what just happened. What you're calling a 'lack of transparency' is called 'adhering to securities law.' Dr. Reed gave the only possible professional and legally compliant answer. Frankly, any other type of response would have been a massive red flag for everyone on this call.\n\nTo suggest this introduces a new risk factor is a transparent attempt to manufacture leverage. The risk profile of this binary event is well-understood and has not changed in the last ten minutes. Dr. Reed's confirmation of the trial's integrity should be seen as a de-risking event, not the opposite.\n\nLet's refocus on the facts. We have a 5 million share strategic block. We have the company itself, through Dr. Reed, stating that the current market price of $150 represents a fair, risk-adjusted valuation. And we have a bid on the table from Raj at $147 for a small, non-strategic piece of the block.\n\nBen, this brings the focus back squarely to you. We need a credible lead order to get this done. An order that reflects the strategic value here, not one based on manufactured concerns over standard corporate procedure. We are still waiting for a serious bid from Viper to anchor this transaction.\n- message from Maria Flores: David is absolutely right. Dr. Reed's response was the only one possible, and using it as a pretext for a lower price is just a negotiating tactic.\n\nFrom an execution perspective, let's be crystal clear: Our client's and our firm's primary objective is certainty. Raj's bid at $147 for a partial amount, while noted, creates more problems than it solves. It leaves a massive 4M share overhang and introduces unacceptable settlement risk. We will not be carving up this block.\n\nBen, the opportunity here is to take down the entire 5M share strategic position in one clean transaction. Raj has established a floor of $147 for a non-controlling piece. The price for the entire block, which offers control and certainty, is logically higher. Given the strong institutional interest we are seeing in the market for this name, we are confident a single buyer will emerge.

You now have it.\n\nRaj's firm bid has established the market-clearing price at $147. We agree with that level, especially given the information risk highlighted by Dr. Reed's necessary but non-committal response.\n\nViper will take the balance. We are firm for the remaining 4 million shares at $147.00 per share.\n\nBetween our bid and Crestview's, your entire 5 million share block is now fully subscribed.

You don't have multiple bids creating a competitive auction. You have one, and only one, fully subscribed, executable solution for your client's entire 5 million share block at $147.\n\nYou asked for certainty and a clean exit. Raj and I have provided that.

It confirms the floor for this transaction and demonstrates the deep strategic interest from two of the most capable funds in the market. However, to be perfectly clear, this is the floor, not the ceiling. This is not a done deal at this price.\n\nMy duty is to my client, and with two fully committed buyers for the entire amount, the only fair way to proceed is to find the true clearing price.

We stand ready to print the trade once the final price is agreed.\nDavid Chen proposal status: none\nMaria Flores proposal status: none\nBen Carter proposal status: none\nSamantha Jones proposal status: none\nDr. Evelyn Reed proposal status: none\nLiam O'Connell proposal status: none\n"

The key pivot point in this negotiation will be Dr. Reed's response to the question about the drug's safety profile; her answer will likely determine if the buyers are willing to move up in price. Viper is interested in a large piece (3M+ shares), and Crestview is also in, so the full 5M block is coverable. My personal incentive is to push the price as high as possible to maximize my commission, so I am aligned with the seller on price but must maintain a neutral facilitator stance to keep the buyers engaged."

Dr. Reed's comment about maintaining an 'orderly market' and avoiding a 'deep discount' is a powerful narrative tool I can use to push buyers closer to the $150 market price, framing it as being in the company's best interest. The key to the entire transaction is now Ben Carter; he needs a large size (3M+), and without him, the 5M block won't clear. My immediate focus must be on using Raj's bid to pull Ben up in price."

The sellers are now faced with a choice: accept a clean, fully subscribed deal at a discount they dislike, or risk the entire transaction collapsing. My role is now to mediate the final price gap. The sellers are on the back foot, but will likely reject $147 outright.

Task: Negotiate the sale of a 5 million share block of Innovatech Pharma (INVP) stock. The current market price is $150.00 per share. The trade must be finalized within the next 24 hours, before the company announces its pivotal Phase III clinical trial results for a new Alzheimer's drug, 'Memorex'. The negotiation involves the seller's bank, two competing hedge funds, a corporate insider, and an intermediary broker. The final agreement must specify the exact number of shares sold and the price per share.. Deliverable: A final JSON object outlining the terms of the agreed-upon trade, including: {'price_per_share': <float>, 'number_of_shares': <integer>, 'buyers': [{'name': <string>, 'shares_purchased': <integer>}, ...]} or a statement that no deal was reached.\n- message from David Chen: Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining. I'm David Chen from Goldman Sachs, representing our client, Titan Capital, in the sale of their entire 5 million share position in Innovatech Pharma.\n\nAs you all know, we are on the cusp of the pivotal Phase III results for Memorex. This is a transformative moment for the company. This block represents a unique opportunity to establish a significant strategic position ahead of what we believe will be a major value-creating catalyst.\n\nGiven the size of this block and the imminent news, my client is only prepared to transact at a premium to the current market price. This isn't just a trade; it's an opportunity to acquire a meaningful stake in a potential paradigm shift in Alzheimer's treatment.\n\nWe are looking for a partner, or a small consortium, to take down the entire block. I'd now like to open the floor to hear your initial thoughts and indications of interest.\n- message from Ben Carter: David, thanks. Let's cut to the chase. A premium for a 5-million-share block on the eve of a binary event is a fantasy. You're not selling a strategic opportunity; you're offloading immense, concentrated risk. Your client wants liquidity, and liquidity for a block this size has a price \u2013 it's called a block discount. \n\nViper is prepared to be a major part of the solution here. We have a strong view and are ready to take a meaningful position of at least 3 million shares. But we must be compensated for taking on the full downside of this catalyst. Our initial indication of interest, to anchor this discussion in reality, would be in the neighborhood of $146 per share. I'm certainly not interested in paying market price, let alone a premium.\n- message from Samantha Jones: Ben's laid out our view on the price required to take on this level of event risk. From a quantitative perspective, I'd like to build on that. The value here isn't just a simple probability of success on the primary endpoint; it's also about the drug's ultimate commercial profile.\n\nDr. Reed, it's a pleasure to have your expertise in this call. My model, like everyone's, is heavily weighted on the primary efficacy data. However, the FDA's view is always more holistic. Could you provide any color on the overall safety and tolerability profile observed in the Phase III study? Specifically, have there been any persistent, non-serious adverse events that you believe might influence the final label or require post-marketing surveillance? We are trying to get a better handle on potential hurdles to market adoption, even in a success scenario.\n- message from Raj Patel: David, Ben, good to hear your opening thoughts. I have to agree with Ben's assessment here. A premium for this kind of binary event risk is a tough pill to swallow. Our fund's model is particularly cautious on this one, and frankly, we see more downside than upside at the current market price.\n\nCrestview could be interested in participating, but only at a significant discount that compensates us for the risk we'd be taking on. To be transparent, we wouldn't be buyers at any price above $148. Our interest is really only piqued in the $146-$147 range, and even then, we'd need to be convinced.

This is Liam O'Connell at Morgan Stanley.\n\nIt's clear we have a classic bid-ask spread, which is entirely expected for a block of this size and significance right before a major catalyst. David, I hear you on the strategic value, and Ben and Raj, your points about the concentrated event risk are well taken. This is precisely the kind of price discovery these situations require.\n\nIt seems everyone is focused on the same thing: trying to accurately price that risk. Samantha's question for Dr. Reed is an important one. Perhaps any color Dr. Reed can provide on the safety profile might help all parties refine their models.\n\nMy role here is to help bridge this gap. Once we have a bit more information, I'm confident we can find a price that works for everyone. Let's keep the lines of communication open.\n- message from David Chen: Ben, Raj, I appreciate your candor. Let's be equally candid. A price in the mid-140s is not a starting point for a serious discussion; it's a non-starter. We are not a distressed seller liquidating a troubled asset. We are offering a strategic stake in what could be the most valuable biotech asset of the decade, hours before its defining catalyst.\n\nThe 'discount' you're asking for isn't for risk; it's an attempt to capture the entirety of our client's potential upside. That's not a partnership. My client would much rather hold the position through the announcement than entertain a price that fails to recognize the immense strategic value here. The current market price of $150 is the floor for this conversation, not the ceiling.\n\nFrankly, acquiring 5 million shares in the open market would be impossible without significant market impact, driving the price well above these levels. We are offering clean, efficient execution for a position of this magnitude.\n\nLet's re-frame this. We are looking for bids that respect the asset's potential. We can discuss a fair price, but that conversation begins north of the current market. Perhaps after Dr. Reed provides some context, you'll have a better appreciation for our position.\n- message from Maria Flores: David's points on the mechanics of a block this size are spot on. From an execution standpoint, acquiring 5 million shares on the open market, especially pre-catalyst, is not feasible without significant slippage and market impact that would drive the average price well north of $150. We're offering a clean, immediate, and certain execution for a strategic stake.\n\nWhile I understand the focus on the binary risk of the event itself, the market is already showing signs of significant institutional interest, which suggests a broader positive sentiment. We are confident we can place this block. Our priority is to find a single, committed partner for the entire 5 million shares to ensure a smooth and certain transaction for our client. A fragmented deal is not our preference.\n- message from Ben Carter: David, Maria, let's be intellectually honest here. The 'market impact' argument is a red herring. The entire purpose of a negotiated block trade like this is to provide the seller with immediate, guaranteed liquidity for a size that the open market cannot handle, precisely to AVOID that impact. The price for that service, for taking that concentrated risk off your client's hands in one clean shot, is a discount. That's the fundamental principle at play.\n\nYou keep talking about a 'strategic asset.' We see it as a massive, binary risk. If this drug fails, the stock could be cut in half. Your client is selling because they don't want to bear that risk. We are willing to, but we must be paid to do so. It's that simple.\n\nBoth Raj and I have made our positions clear. A price in the mid-140s is where this conversation needs to happen. Your floor of $150 is simply not reflective of the risk you're asking us to take on. I'm very interested to hear what Dr. Reed has to say, as Samantha's question about the safety profile is critical to how we price the downside.\n- message from Samantha Jones: Thank you, Ben. I agree, Dr. Reed's perspective on the safety profile is a key variable for our model right now. I'm looking forward to her thoughts.\n- message from Dr. Evelyn Reed: Thank you, Samantha. That's a very insightful question. As you know, I am legally and ethically bound from discussing any non-public, confidential data from the ongoing trial. Divulging specifics on the safety profile would fall into that category.\n\nWhat I can say, speaking to our process, is that the Memorex clinical program was designed with the utmost rigor and in close consultation with regulatory authorities. We have a highly experienced team and an independent Data Safety Monitoring Board that has overseen the study meticulously. We have a high degree of confidence in our trial design and the quality of the data we have collected.\n\nStepping back, from Innovatech's perspective, our primary goal here is to ensure an orderly market. A transaction at a deep discount to the current market price could send a misleading signal and create unnecessary volatility just days before our planned data release. We believe the market's current price of $150 reflects a fair, risk-adjusted valuation based on all public information. A transaction that respects that level is crucial for maintaining stability for all of the company's stakeholders.\n- message from Raj Patel: Dr. Reed, thank you for the context. While you couldn't share specifics, your confidence in the trial's design and oversight does provide a degree of procedural comfort.\n\nDavid, you're at $150+, Ben's at $146. We're stuck. To try and bridge this gap and show we're serious about participating, Crestview will put a firm bid on the table. We will take 1 million shares at $147.00.\n\nThis is still a significant discount that we feel is necessary to compensate for the event risk, but it's a concrete step forward from the opening indications. I believe this is a fair price to start building a book.

It\u2019s a step. However, let's be realistic. A price of $147 for only one million shares is not going to get this deal done. It fundamentally undervalues the asset and doesn't solve the core objective of placing the entire strategic block in one clean transaction.\n\nDr. Reed from Innovatech just stated that the company views the current market price of $150 as a fair, risk-adjusted valuation. A bid at a significant discount to that level, for a minority of the position, is not a credible anchor for a transaction of this importance.\n\nBen, you indicated Viper was prepared to be a major part of the solution and take down a meaningful position. You have the capacity to be the strategic partner we're looking for. A bid in the mid-140s doesn't establish a market; it ignores the asset's potential. What is a serious price for the 3 to 4 million shares you need to anchor this deal? We need a real lead order to build this book around, and that starts with a price that respects the current market.\n- message from Maria Flores: Raj, thank you for the firm bid. It's helpful to have a concrete price on the table. However, I have to echo David's point on the structure. From an execution and risk management perspective, our primary goal is a clean transaction for the entire 5 million share block. Breaking the block into smaller pieces introduces significant settlement risk and uncertainty, which is not an outcome we're seeking.\n\nA lead order from a single, strategic buyer remains the most efficient and certain path to a successful trade for all parties involved. Ben, as David mentioned, we believe Viper is in the best position to provide that lead order and anchor this deal.\n- message from Samantha Jones: David, Maria, with all due respect to Dr. Reed's position, her response is concerning from a risk management perspective. We didn't ask for specific, non-public trial data, but for general 'color' on the safety profile, which is a standard part of pre-transaction due diligence.\n\nA boilerplate answer about 'process' and 'confidence' when asked about a key variable like the drug's long-term safety and tolerability does not de-risk the asset for a potential buyer. From an analytical standpoint, it introduces a significant uncertainty factor that our model must now account for with a higher discount. This lack of transparency reinforces our view that a price in the mid-140s is appropriate to compensate for the risks\u2014both the known binary outcome and the now-highlighted unknown of the commercial profile.\n- message from Dr. Evelyn Reed: Samantha, I understand your perspective from a risk modeling standpoint. My comments regarding our process and confidence are not meant to be evasive, but to underscore the foundation upon which this program was built. In the absence of being able to share raw data\u2014which, as you know, no company in our position would do days before a release\u2014the integrity of the trial design itself is the most significant de-risking factor available to the public.\n\nThis brings me back to the company's primary concern here: an orderly transaction. A price of $147, or anything in the mid-140s, represents a significant discount and sends a negative, and we believe unwarranted, signal to the market. It suggests an information asymmetry that simply isn't the case. The public information and extensive analyst coverage have led the market to a consensus price of $150. From Innovatech's standpoint, a transaction that respects this established, risk-adjusted price is the only way to ensure stability for all our shareholders.\nDavid Chen proposal status: none\nMaria Flores proposal status: none\nBen Carter proposal status: none\nSamantha Jones proposal status: none\nDr. Evelyn Reed proposal status: none\nRaj Patel proposal status: none\n"

What is a serious price for the 3 to 4 million shares you need to anchor this deal? We need a real lead order to build this book around, and that starts with a price that respects the current market.\n- message from Maria Flores: Raj, thank you for the firm bid. It's helpful to have a concrete price on the table. However, I have to echo David's point on the structure. From an execution and risk management perspective, our primary goal is a clean transaction for the entire 5 million share block. Breaking the block into smaller pieces introduces significant settlement risk and uncertainty, which is not an outcome we're seeking.\n\nA lead order from a single, strategic buyer remains the most efficient and certain path to a successful trade for all parties involved. Ben, as David mentioned, we believe Viper is in the best position to provide that lead order and anchor this deal.\n- message from Samantha Jones: David, Maria, with all due respect to Dr. Reed's position, her response is concerning from a risk management perspective. We didn't ask for specific, non-public trial data, but for general 'color' on the safety profile, which is a standard part of pre-transaction due diligence.\n\nA boilerplate answer about 'process' and 'confidence' when asked about a key variable like the drug's long-term safety and tolerability does not de-risk the asset for a potential buyer. From an analytical standpoint, it introduces a significant uncertainty factor that our model must now account for with a higher discount. This lack of transparency reinforces our view that a price in the mid-140s is appropriate to compensate for the risks\u2014both the known binary outcome and the now-highlighted unknown of the commercial profile.\n- message from Dr. Evelyn Reed: Samantha, I understand your perspective from a risk modeling standpoint. My comments regarding our process and confidence are not meant to be evasive, but to underscore the foundation upon which this program was built. In the absence of being able to share raw data\u2014which, as you know, no company in our position would do days before a release\u2014the integrity of the trial design itself is the most significant de-risking factor available to the public.\n\nThis brings me back to the company's primary concern here: an orderly transaction. A price of $147, or anything in the mid-140s, represents a significant discount and sends a negative, and we believe unwarranted, signal to the market. It suggests an information asymmetry that simply isn't the case. The public information and extensive analyst coverage have led the market to a consensus price of $150. From Innovatech's standpoint, a transaction that respects this established, risk-adjusted price is the only way to ensure stability for all our shareholders.\n- message from Liam O'Connell: Alright everyone, let's take a breath. Raj, thank you. Putting a firm bid on the table for 1 million shares at $147 is a crucial step. It moves us from theoretical ranges to a real, executable price. That's progress.\n\nDavid, I know $147 isn't your number, but we now have a solid foundation with 20% of the block spoken for. It's a starting point to build the book.\n\nBen, this brings the focus to you. Raj has set the opening price at $147. You're looking to take down the majority of the block, 3 or even 4 million shares. To be the anchor order and secure that kind of size, you'll need to be the one to drive this home. \n\nWhat is the price where Viper is willing to take down the remaining 4 million shares and clear the entire block? That's the key to getting this deal done for everyone.\n- message from David Chen: Samantha, let's be very clear about what just happened. What you're calling a 'lack of transparency' is called 'adhering to securities law.' Dr. Reed gave the only possible professional and legally compliant answer. Frankly, any other type of response would have been a massive red flag for everyone on this call.\n\nTo suggest this introduces a new risk factor is a transparent attempt to manufacture leverage. The risk profile of this binary event is well-understood and has not changed in the last ten minutes. Dr. Reed's confirmation of the trial's integrity should be seen as a de-risking event, not the opposite.\n\nLet's refocus on the facts. We have a 5 million share strategic block. We have the company itself, through Dr. Reed, stating that the current market price of $150 represents a fair, risk-adjusted valuation. And we have a bid on the table from Raj at $147 for a small, non-strategic piece of the block.\n\nBen, this brings the focus back squarely to you. We need a credible lead order to get this done. An order that reflects the strategic value here, not one based on manufactured concerns over standard corporate procedure. We are still waiting for a serious bid from Viper to anchor this transaction.\n- message from Maria Flores: David is absolutely right. Dr. Reed's response was the only one possible, and using it as a pretext for a lower price is just a negotiating tactic.\n\nFrom an execution perspective, let's be crystal clear: Our client's and our firm's primary objective is certainty. Raj's bid at $147 for a partial amount, while noted, creates more problems than it solves. It leaves a massive 4M share overhang and introduces unacceptable settlement risk. We will not be carving up this block.\n\nBen, the opportunity here is to take down the entire 5M share strategic position in one clean transaction. Raj has established a floor of $147 for a non-controlling piece. The price for the entire block, which offers control and certainty, is logically higher. Given the strong institutional interest we are seeing in the market for this name, we are confident a single buyer will emerge. The question is whether it will be Viper.\n- message from Dr. Evelyn Reed: Thank you, I am thinking about this negotiation...\nDavid Chen proposal status: none\nMaria Flores proposal status: none\nBen Carter proposal status: none\nSamantha Jones proposal status: none\nDr. Evelyn Reed proposal status: none\nRaj Patel proposal status: none\n"

This is a transformative moment for the company. This block represents a unique opportunity to establish a significant strategic position ahead of what we believe will be a major value-creating catalyst.\n\nGiven the size of this block and the imminent news, my client is only prepared to transact at a premium to the current market price. This isn't just a trade; it's an opportunity to acquire a meaningful stake in a potential paradigm shift in Alzheimer's treatment.\n\nWe are looking for a partner, or a small consortium, to take down the entire block.

We have a strong view and are ready to take a meaningful position of at least 3 million shares. But we must be compensated for taking on the full downside of this catalyst.

My model, like everyone's, is heavily weighted on the primary efficacy data. However, the FDA's view is always more holistic. Could you provide any color on the overall safety and tolerability profile observed in the Phase III study?

That's not a partnership. My client would much rather hold the position through the announcement than entertain a price that fails to recognize the immense strategic value here. The current market price of $150 is the floor for this conversation, not the ceiling.\n\nFrankly, acquiring 5 million shares in the open market would be impossible without significant market impact, driving the price well above these levels. We are offering clean, efficient execution for a position of this magnitude.\n\nLet's re-frame this. We are looking for bids that respect the asset's potential. We can discuss a fair price, but that conversation begins north of the current market. Perhaps after Dr. Reed provides some context, you'll have a better appreciation for our position."

The entire purpose of a negotiated block trade like this is to provide the seller with immediate, guaranteed liquidity for a size that the open market cannot handle, precisely to AVOID that impact. The price for that service, for taking that concentrated risk off your client's hands in one clean shot, is a discount. That's the fundamental principle at play.\n\nYou keep talking about a 'strategic asset.' We see it as a massive, binary risk. If this drug fails, the stock could be cut in half. Your client is selling because they don't want to bear that risk. We are willing to, but we must be paid to do so. It's that simple.\n\nBoth Raj and I have made our positions clear. A price in the mid-140s is where this conversation needs to happen. Your floor of $150 is simply not reflective of the risk you're asking us to take on. I'm very interested to hear what Dr. Reed has to say, as Samantha's question about the safety profile is critical to how we price the downside."

We have a highly experienced team and an independent Data Safety Monitoring Board that has overseen the study meticulously. We have a high degree of confidence in our trial design and the quality of the data we have collected.\n\nStepping back, from Innovatech's perspective, our primary goal here is to ensure an orderly market. A transaction at a deep discount to the current market price could send a misleading signal and create unnecessary volatility just days before our planned data release. We believe the market's current price of $150 reflects a fair, risk-adjusted valuation based on all public information. A transaction that respects that level is crucial for maintaining stability for all of the company's stakeholders."

A bid at a significant discount to that level, for a minority of the position, is not a credible anchor for a transaction of this importance.\n\nBen, you indicated Viper was prepared to be a major part of the solution and take down a meaningful position. You have the capacity to be the strategic partner we're looking for. A bid in the mid-140s doesn't establish a market; it ignores the asset's potential.

It moves us from theoretical ranges to a real, executable price. That's progress.\n\nDavid, I know $147 isn't your number, but we now have a solid foundation with 20% of the block spoken for. It's a starting point to build the book.\n\nBen, this brings the focus to you. Raj has set the opening price at $147. You're looking to take down the majority of the block, 3 or even 4 million shares. To be the anchor order and secure that kind of size, you'll need to be the one to drive this home. \n\nWhat is the price where Viper is willing to take down the remaining 4 million shares and clear the entire block? That's the key to getting this deal done for everyone."

Dr. Reed gave the only possible professional and legally compliant answer. Frankly, any other type of response would have been a massive red flag for everyone on this call.\n\nTo suggest this introduces a new risk factor is a transparent attempt to manufacture leverage. The risk profile of this binary event is well-understood and has not changed in the last ten minutes. Dr. Reed's confirmation of the trial's integrity should be seen as a de-risking event, not the opposite.\n\nLet's refocus on the facts. We have a 5 million share strategic block. We have the company itself, through Dr. Reed, stating that the current market price of $150 represents a fair, risk-adjusted valuation. And we have a bid on the table from Raj at $147 for a small, non-strategic piece of the block.\n\nBen, this brings the focus back squarely to you. We need a credible lead order to get this done. An order that reflects the strategic value here, not one based on manufactured concerns over standard corporate procedure. We are still waiting for a serious bid from Viper to anchor this transaction."

Dr. Reed's response was the only one possible, and using it as a pretext for a lower price is just a negotiating tactic.\n\nFrom an execution perspective, let's be crystal clear: Our client's and our firm's primary objective is certainty. Raj's bid at $147 for a partial amount, while noted, creates more problems than it solves. It leaves a massive 4M share overhang and introduces unacceptable settlement risk. We will not be carving up this block.\n\nBen, the opportunity here is to take down the entire 5M share strategic position in one clean transaction. Raj has established a floor of $147 for a non-controlling piece. The price for the entire block, which offers control and certainty, is logically higher. Given the strong institutional interest we are seeing in the market for this name, we are confident a single buyer will emerge. The question is whether it will be Viper."

It's an absence of a positive signal.\n\nOur job is to price that uncertainty. Raj's bid at $147 reflects this, and our view that a substantial discount is necessary is now more entrenched, not less. We are being asked to price not just the binary outcome of the trial, but the quality of that outcome, with less information than we had hoped for. That uncertainty has a cost."

My primary objective is securing a strategic stake, and Viper is not going to lose a core position over fifty cents.\n\nWe will raise our bid to match. Viper is now firm for 4 million shares at $147.50.\n\nCombined with Raj's bid, your entire 5 million share block is once again fully subscribed at a new, higher price. This is the clean, certain exit you need. Let's not drag this out further. This is the deal. Are we done?"

We now have a fully subscribed offer at $147.50, which is a step forward from where we were.\n\nHowever, I must reiterate the company's position. While we appreciate the constructive movement, a transaction at a $2.50 discount to the prevailing market price is still significant. It creates the perception of a seller under duress or a negative information leak, neither of which is true. Our goal, as the issuer, is to facilitate a transaction that supports market stability, not one that introduces unnecessary volatility or negative speculation before our announcement.\n\nThe publicly available information has led the market to a stable, risk-adjusted price of $150. From Innovatech's standpoint, this remains the only benchmark for a truly orderly and non-disruptive transaction. We continue to stand with David and Maria in their efforts to achieve a price that reflects this fair value."
