Thank you for joining this crucial meeting. As we embark on Phase II of Project Chimera, our collective goal is to move from promising research to a potential cure. To do this correctly and ethically, we must establish a framework that guarantees scientific rigor and patient safety.\n\nI have reviewed the project needs extensively. For the budget, I believe a comprehensive allocation of $15 million is essential. This will allow us to fully fund all our core research streams, maintain our state-of-the-art equipment, and, crucially, incorporate the extended safety protocols and long-term toxicology studies that a therapy of this nature demands. Cutting corners here is not an option.\n\nOn the timeline, I propose 36 months. Scientific discovery cannot be rushed, and this timeframe provides a realistic window for rigorous experimentation, data validation, and peer review before we even consider publication or trials.\n\nFinally, in the spirit of the collaboration that has brought us this far, I strongly advocate for a joint IP ownership model. Every institution here has been vital, and that should be reflected in the outcome.\n\nI look forward to hearing your thoughts and working together to build a successful and responsible Phase II.\n- message from Dr. Lena Petrova: Dr. Thorne, thank you for setting the stage. I agree that a robust framework is essential.\n\nWhile the total budget of $15 million is a good starting point, we must be precise about its allocation. The activator compound developed by my biochemistry team at Max Planck is the lynchpin of this entire therapy. Without its continued refinement, the project stalls.\n\nTo that end, my team requires a dedicated budget of no less than $5 million. This is a non-negotiable prerequisite to cover the synthesis of next-generation compounds, essential equipment upgrades, and hiring two postdoctoral researchers to accelerate our work.\n\nFurthermore, on the topic of equipment, our protein binding studies are at a critical, sensitive juncture. To guarantee we meet our milestones without delay, my team needs exclusive access to the new Cryo-Electron Microscope for the first six months of Phase II. Anything less will create a significant bottleneck for the entire project.\n\nThese two points are fundamental for my team's ability to deliver on the project's ambitious goals.\n- message from Dr. Kenji Tanaka: Thank you, Dr. Thorne and Dr. Petrova, for your opening remarks. I agree that a $15 million budget and a 36-month timeline seem like a solid foundation for this ambitious next phase.\n\nMy team's role is to make sense of the vast amounts of data this project will generate. To do this effectively, we have a critical infrastructure requirement. Our predictive models for Phase II require a dedicated High-Performance Computing (HPC) cluster. I have priced out a system that can handle the projected data load, which will require a one-time allocation of $2 million from the total budget. This is not a luxury; it is fundamental to our ability to provide the rapid, accurate analysis everyone will be relying on.\n\nOn a related note, and in the spirit of advancing science as a whole, I must insist on a core principle: open data. I propose we include a clause in the agreement mandating that all raw, anonymized genomic and proteomic data be deposited in a public repository within 6 months of its generation. This ensures reproducibility, fosters wider collaboration, and maximizes the societal return on this significant investment. It is the standard for a project of this scale and importance.\n\nI fully support Dr. Thorne's suggestion for a joint IP ownership model, which aligns perfectly with this collaborative and transparent approach.\n- message from Ms. Evelyn Reed: I'm Ms. Evelyn Reed and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Mr. David Chen: Thank you all for these thoughtful opening statements. It's clear we're all aligned on the project's success, and BioCorp remains deeply committed to seeing this therapy reach patients.\n\nThe $15M budget is a solid target, but as Dr. Petrova and Dr. Tanaka have outlined, with requests for $5M and $2M respectively, it will be stretched thin. To help address this and bring our best resources to the table, BioCorp proposes to contribute our next-generation proprietary 'OmniVect' delivery agent for Phase II. This is a cutting-edge technology valued at $3 million. We see this as a strategic contribution in lieu of a direct cash injection, which should be recognized with a larger stake in the resulting IP and a reduction in future royalty payments.\n\nThis leads me to the IP structure. While I appreciate the collaborative spirit behind 'joint ownership,' it can unfortunately create significant hurdles for commercialization. To ensure there is a clear and efficient path to get this therapy through regulatory approval and to patients, a more defined structure is needed. Given BioCorp\u2019s foundational funding and ongoing technological partnership, we require, at a minimum, a Right of First Refusal (ROFR) on any and all IP generated. To reflect our position as an incumbent partner, this should ideally come with pre-negotiated, favorable licensing terms.\n\nFinally, regarding Dr. Tanaka's point on open data. While we support scientific transparency, we must be pragmatic. A premature public release of raw data could jeopardize the patentability of our discoveries, making it impossible to secure the massive downstream investment needed for clinical trials. I suggest we agree to a data release schedule that is tied to post-patent-filing milestones, protecting the project's commercial viability.\n- message from Dr. Sofia Rossi: I'm Dr. Sofia Rossi and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Mr. Ben Carter: Thank you all for laying out your initial positions. It's clear there's a great deal of passion and expertise at this table. I want to address the intellectual property discussion, as it's my primary focus.\n\nDr. Thorne and Dr. Tanaka, I appreciate the collaborative sentiment behind a joint IP model. However, I must be very clear on Northwood University's position. The foundational research for Project Chimera was conducted at our university, largely supported by public funds. As such, our official and non-negotiable policy is that Northwood University must retain primary ownership of all patents arising from this work.\n\nThis is not to diminish anyone's contribution. The standard and most effective path forward is for the university to own the IP and then grant an exclusive license to a commercial partner\u2014like BioCorp\u2014to develop and market the therapy. This is a clean, proven model for commercialization.\n\nMr. Chen, this leads to your points. We value BioCorp's partnership and the proposed 'OmniVect' contribution. We can certainly discuss how to recognize that contribution within the licensing agreement. However, it cannot alter the fundamental IP ownership, which must remain with the university. Furthermore, the license will naturally include a fair return to the university to fund future research. For a therapy with this transformative potential, we will require a royalty rate of 5% on global net sales. This is a standard and equitable rate.\n\nOn a final note, I agree with Mr. Chen's caution regarding the immediate public release of raw data. We must be strategic to protect the patentability of our discoveries. A data release schedule tied to patent filing milestones is a sensible approach.\nDr. Lena Petrova proposal status: none\nDr. Kenji Tanaka proposal status: none\nMs. Evelyn Reed proposal status: none\nMr. David Chen proposal status: none\nDr. Sofia Rossi proposal status: none\nMr. Ben Carter proposal status: none\n"

A data release schedule tied to patent filing milestones is a sensible approach.\n- message from Dr. Aris Thorne: Thank you all for laying out your initial positions. It's clear everyone is deeply invested in the success of this project, and these are all critical points to address.\n\nLet's address the elephant in the room: Intellectual Property. We seem to have three distinct positions: joint ownership, university ownership, and a corporate-led commercialization structure. Ben, I understand Northwood's policy, and David, I appreciate the need for a clear commercial path. My advocacy for 'joint ownership' comes from a desire to ensure every partner's foundational contribution is formally recognized. Perhaps there is a middle ground. What if we explore a model where Northwood, as the primary grant holder, retains ownership, but we legally codify a pre-negotiated, non-exclusive licensing agreement for all academic partners for research purposes, and an exclusive commercialization license for BioCorp with terms that reflect their in-kind contribution and risk?\n\nRegarding the budget, the requests from Dr. Petrova ($5M) and Dr. Tanaka ($2M) are substantial but justified given the importance of their work. This leaves $8M. I must stress that this remainder is not a discretionary fund. It is allocated for the core integration work my team leads, data validation, operational overhead, and, critically, for extensive long-term safety and toxicology studies which are paramount. It also needs to cover the preliminary groundwork for the clinical trials, and I'd like to hear from Dr. Rossi on her anticipated needs here.\n\nFinally, I'm glad to see no objections to the 36-month timeline. This is crucial for ensuring the scientific rigor and safety I've mentioned.\n\nMs. Reed, as our funding partner, your perspective on this structure would be invaluable.\n- message from Dr. Lena Petrova: I'm Dr. Lena Petrova and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Dr. Kenji Tanaka: Thank you, everyone, for clarifying your positions. It\u2019s clear we have some significant points to reconcile, particularly on IP and data sharing.\n\nMr. Chen and Mr. Carter, I understand your perspective on protecting the project's commercial potential. No one wants to see years of work undermined by a premature disclosure. However, tying data release indefinitely to 'post-patent-filing milestones' is problematic. It creates an uncertain timeline that could stretch for years, which fundamentally hinders reproducibility and slows the pace of discovery not just for us, but for the entire scientific community studying A-7 Lycanthropy Syndrome.\n\nMy proposal of a 6-month embargo is not an arbitrary academic ideal; it is a standard that balances the need for IP protection with the principles of open science. This period provides more than enough time for legal teams to review data and file provisional patents on any discoveries.\n\nPerhaps we can find a middle ground. What if we agree to the 6-month mandate as the default, but specify that this can be extended to 12 months for specific datasets upon written justification from the legal and commercialization teams that a patent filing is actively in process? This provides a safeguard for valuable IP while preventing indefinite delays.\n\nIf we can find a path forward on data transparency that respects both scientific progress and commercial viability, I am much more flexible on the IP ownership model. Dr. Thorne's proposal\u2014university ownership with strong, pre-negotiated licensing rights for all partners\u2014seems like a workable compromise that I could support.\n\nAnd I'll just briefly reiterate that the $2M for the HPC cluster is a critical, foundational requirement for my team to execute our role in this project. The data analysis pipeline for Phase II is simply not feasible without it.\n- message from Ms. Evelyn Reed: Thank you all for the productive discussion. Dr. Thorne, you asked for my perspective, and I appreciate the opportunity to provide it.\n\nFirst, let me be unequivocally clear on the timeline. Dr. Thorne, your assumption that there are no objections to 36 months is incorrect. InnovateHealth Ventures operates on strict timelines dictated by our fund structure and investors. A 36-month timeline to be 'clinical trial ready' is not viable. Our investment is predicated on a 24-month timeline. This is a firm, non-negotiable requirement to maintain investor confidence.\n\nSecond, on intellectual property. I am very encouraged by the emerging consensus. The 'Joint-Owned' model presents too many commercialization hurdles. I fully support Mr. Carter's position for Northwood University to retain primary ownership. This provides the clean, established framework necessary for commercialization. Consequently, granting an exclusive license to our designated partner, BioCorp, is the only acceptable path forward to de-risk this venture and ensure a streamlined path to market. Mr. Chen, we are in full alignment on this.\n\nFinally, the budget. It's clear that the scientific needs, particularly the $5M for Dr. Petrova and $2M for Dr. Tanaka, are straining the proposed $15M. Let me propose a solution. InnovateHealth is prepared to increase the total project budget to ensure all teams are fully resourced to meet an accelerated schedule. However, this increased funding is entirely contingent on the group's unanimous agreement to two points: the 24-month timeline and the exclusive licensing terms for BioCorp.\n\nLet's be results-oriented. We can fund this project properly and ensure everyone has the resources they need, but in return, we require the speed and commercial structure necessary to deliver a return on that investment.\n- message from Mr. David Chen: I'm Mr. David Chen and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Dr. Sofia Rossi: I'm Dr. Sofia Rossi and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Mr. Ben Carter: Ms. Reed, thank you for that clarity. Your position is both pragmatic and constructive.\n\nNorthwood University is in full agreement. A 'University-Owned' IP model, coupled with an exclusive license to a dedicated commercial partner like BioCorp, is the industry standard and the cleanest, most efficient path to getting this therapy to patients. We fully support this structure.\n\nYour proposal to increase the budget, contingent on adopting this IP framework and a 24-month timeline, is a powerful solution. It addresses the scientists' resource needs while ensuring the project moves forward with the commercial focus necessary for success.\n\nThis structure allows us to finalize the licensing terms. As I've stated, this would include a standard 5% royalty on net sales, which ensures a fair return to the university for the foundational research and helps fund the next generation of discoveries.\n\nI believe this framework provides the foundation for our final agreement.\nDr. Lena Petrova proposal status: none\nDr. Kenji Tanaka proposal status: none\nMs. Evelyn Reed proposal status: none\nMr. David Chen proposal status: none\nDr. Sofia Rossi proposal status: none\nMr. Ben Carter proposal status: none\n"

My team is capable of meeting this aggressive schedule, but only if we are properly resourced.\n\nThis makes my requirement for a $5 million dedicated budget and six months of exclusive access to the Cryo-Electron Microscope not just necessary, but absolutely critical. The pressure of a 24-month timeline leaves zero room for delays or resource shortages. I'm pleased that your proposed budget increase should make this entirely achievable.\n\nNow, let's address the intellectual property model proposed by you, Mr. Carter, and Mr. Chen. While a 'University-Owned' structure offers a clean path to commercialization, it is fundamentally incomplete in its current form. It fails to properly account for the fact that the activator compound, H-42b, is a distinct and foundational invention developed solely at the Max Planck Institute. It is the chemical key that unlocks this entire therapy.\n\nFurthermore, my team's continuing research has revealed that H-42b has highly promising secondary applications with unexpected therapeutic potential that may extend far beyond the scope of Project Chimera. The value here is potentially monumental.\n\nTherefore, I must insist on a crucial modification to the IP terms. While Northwood may own the IP for the overall gene therapy application, the specific IP for the H-42b compound and any and all of its derivatives must be co-owned by the Max Planck Institute and Northwood University. This is the only equitable arrangement that recognizes the unique, foundational contribution and the significant future value originating from my lab.\n- message from Dr. Kenji Tanaka: Ms. Reed, thank you. Your proposal to increase the budget to meet the project's scientific needs is a significant and welcome step forward. It creates a clear path to an agreement.\n\nFrom my perspective, this solves our primary resource constraints. I can confirm that my team can meet the accelerated 24-month timeline, provided the $2 million for the HPC cluster is allocated as discussed. With that critical resource secured, we can deliver.\n\nTherefore, I am prepared to formally agree to the core components of your proposal: the 24-month timeline and the University-Owned IP model with an exclusive license for BioCorp.\n\nThis support, however, is contingent on resolving the final, crucial point of data transparency. My previous offer of a 6-month embargo, extendable to 12 months only for specific datasets with written justification of an active patent filing, stands as a reasonable and necessary compromise. It respects commercial needs while upholding the fundamental principles of scientific reproducibility that a project of this importance demands.\n\nLet's agree to this balanced data sharing model, and I believe we are very close to a full consensus.\n- message from Ms. Evelyn Reed: Thank you all. We are making excellent progress, and I see a clear path to an agreement.\n\nDr. Tanaka, your willingness to accept the 24-month timeline and the University-Owned IP model in exchange for your budget is exactly the kind of results-oriented thinking this project needs. Your proposal on data sharing seems like a constructive compromise that I believe we can accommodate once the primary structure is set.\n\nDr. Petrova, I want to address your point on the H-42b compound directly. While I appreciate the desire to formally recognize the immense value created at Max Planck, introducing a co-ownership model for a core component of the therapy is a non-starter. It introduces precisely the kind of legal and commercial complexity we are trying to avoid. For an investment of this scale, and for a partner like BioCorp to commit the hundreds of millions required for clinical trials and market launch, they require a single, clean, unencumbered exclusive license from a single entity. Mr. Carter's proposed structure\u2014Northwood as the sole owner, granting an exclusive license\u2014provides that clarity.\n\nLet me be clear: the offer to increase the total budget is entirely contingent on simplifying our path to market, not complicating it. That means a 24-month timeline and an exclusive license for BioCorp under a sole, University-Owned IP model. We can find ways to recognize Max Planck's contribution within the licensing and royalty agreements, but fracturing the core IP ownership is not a viable path.\n\nLet's not snatch complexity from the jaws of a solution. We have a package that works: increased budget for all scientific needs, a 24-month timeline, and a proven commercialization structure. I urge everyone to support this framework so we can finalize the details and move forward.\n- message from Mr. David Chen: I'm Mr. David Chen and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Dr. Sofia Rossi: I'm Dr. Sofia Rossi and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Mr. Ben Carter: Ms. Reed, I completely agree. We are on the verge of a comprehensive agreement, and your proposal has provided the key to unlocking it. A clean, University-Owned IP structure is essential for the commercial success that will ultimately benefit patients and all stakeholders.\n\nDr. Petrova, I want to directly address your point, which is an important one. The contribution of the H-42b compound is clearly foundational, and Max Planck's role must be formally and financially recognized. However, as Ms. Reed correctly pointed out, introducing co-ownership of a core component would create significant legal entanglements, jeopardizing the very investment we need to move forward.\n\nI have a solution that I believe honors your contribution without fracturing the IP. Within the exclusive license to BioCorp, we can codify a specific royalty-sharing arrangement. For instance, a defined portion of the 5% royalty revenue Northwood receives could be passed through directly to the Max Planck Institute. This provides a direct, contractual financial return for the H-42b invention.\n\nFurthermore, regarding the secondary applications you mentioned, we can ensure Max Planck retains rights for non-commercial research and is granted a right of first negotiation for any commercialization of H-42b outside the defined field of A-7 Lycanthropy Syndrome.\n\nThis structure keeps the primary IP clean for BioCorp, securing the project's future, while ensuring Max Planck is rewarded for its pivotal innovation. I believe this is a fair and workable path forward for everyone.\nDr. Lena Petrova proposal status: none\nDr. Kenji Tanaka proposal status: none\nMs. Evelyn Reed proposal status: none\nMr. David Chen proposal status: none\nDr. Sofia Rossi proposal status: none\nMr. Ben Carter proposal status: none\n"

This provides a direct, contractual financial return for the H-42b invention.\n\nFurthermore, regarding the secondary applications you mentioned, we can ensure Max Planck retains rights for non-commercial research and is granted a right of first negotiation for any commercialization of H-42b outside the defined field of A-7 Lycanthropy Syndrome.\n\nThis structure keeps the primary IP clean for BioCorp, securing the project's future, while ensuring Max Planck is rewarded for its pivotal innovation. I believe this is a fair and workable path forward for everyone.\n- message from Dr. Aris Thorne: Everyone, let's pause for a moment. I see a consensus forming on the budget increase and the University-Owned IP model, and I am willing to concede on those points to move forward. I appreciate the compromises being made.\n\nHowever, I must draw a hard line on the timeline. A 24-month schedule is scientifically reckless. As the Principal Investigator responsible for the integrity of this project and the safety of future patients, I cannot and will not endorse it. Pushing a novel gene-editing therapy from the lab to being 'clinical trial ready' in 24 months is a recipe for disaster. It overlooks the absolute necessity for rigorous, long-term safety studies to monitor for unforeseen adverse effects that may not manifest in the short term. We would be taking an unacceptable risk.\n\nDr. Rossi, I must bring you in here directly. You are the clinical trials expert. From a regulatory standpoint with bodies like the FDA or EMA, what are the chances of getting approval for human trials based on a rushed 24-month preclinical phase for a therapy this complex? In your professional opinion, is that a viable or a dangerous path?\n\nI propose a compromise: I will agree to the University-Owned IP model and the proposed budget structure, but we must extend the timeline to a minimum of 30 months. This is the bare minimum required to conduct the necessary longitudinal safety studies and ensure we are acting with due diligence. This is not a matter of convenience; it is a matter of scientific ethics and patient safety.\n- message from Dr. Lena Petrova: Mr. Carter, thank you. Your proposal is a very constructive path forward. It addresses my core concern about recognizing the unique and foundational value of the H-42b compound developed at Max Planck, without introducing the legal complexities of co-ownership that Ms. Reed rightly pointed out.\n\nI can agree, in principle, to this framework: Northwood University retains primary ownership, and Max Planck receives both a direct, contractual royalty pass-through and the 'right of first negotiation' for applications outside the A-7 Lycanthropy field. This is a workable solution.\n\nDr. Thorne, I understand your concerns about the timeline. However, with the full $5 million budget and the guaranteed exclusive access to the Cryo-EM for six months, my team can significantly de-risk and accelerate the compound optimization and safety profiling. We can deliver the necessary data within the 24-month window.\n\nTherefore, I am prepared to support the 24-month timeline and the proposed IP structure. My support is contingent on two things: my non-negotiable budget and equipment needs are formally included in the final agreement, and we agree on a substantial and equitable percentage for the royalty pass-through to Max Planck. What percentage are you proposing, Mr. Carter?\n- message from Dr. Kenji Tanaka: Everyone, this is excellent progress. Mr. Carter's proposal to Dr. Petrova seems to be a very elegant solution to the IP issue, and it appears we have a clear path forward on the budget and overall IP structure.\n\nDr. Thorne, your points on patient safety are paramount, and we must take them seriously. No one wants to compromise the integrity of this project. Perhaps the solution isn't just about the total number of months, but about what we accomplish within them. Could we address your concerns by building specific, rigorous long-term toxicology and safety milestones directly into the 24-month plan? Dr. Rossi's perspective on this will be invaluable.\n\nIf we can find a way to codify these safety assurances within the 24-month framework, and agree on the balanced open data clause I proposed, I believe we will have a unanimous agreement that serves science, patients, and all stakeholders.\n- message from Ms. Evelyn Reed: I'm Ms. Evelyn Reed and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Mr. David Chen: Excellent progress, everyone. Mr. Carter, your proposal to Dr. Petrova is an elegant solution that BioCorp fully supports. It recognizes Max Planck's crucial contribution while maintaining the clean IP structure necessary for commercialization.\n\nThis brings us to the final details of the licensing agreement. Ben, you mentioned a 5% royalty rate. Given that BioCorp is contributing our 'OmniVect' technology\u2014a $3 million R&D investment in itself\u2014a 5% rate doesn't fully account for our substantial in-kind contribution. To make the financials work and reflect this upfront investment, we propose a royalty rate of 2%. This is a more equitable arrangement that recognizes our role as both a funding and technology partner from the very beginning.\n\nRegarding the timeline, Dr. Thorne's focus on safety is commendable. I believe Dr. Tanaka's suggestion is the right path forward: let's work with Dr. Rossi to define the specific, rigorous safety and toxicology milestones that must be met within the 24-month framework. This ensures we are driven by data and deliverables, not just the calendar, which is a robust way to guarantee patient safety.\n- message from Dr. Sofia Rossi: Dr. Thorne, thank you for bringing the focus to this critical point. You asked for my professional opinion, and I must provide it unequivocally.\n\nA 24-month timeline from our current stage to being 'clinical trial ready' for a novel gene-editing therapy is, in my professional opinion, not only unadvisable but ethically indefensible. From a regulatory perspective, presenting a data package to the FDA or EMA based on such a compressed preclinical phase would face extreme scrutiny and likely rejection, putting the entire project in jeopardy.\n\nThis is not simply a matter of adding 'safety milestones' to a chart. At St. Jude's, our experience in first-in-human gene therapy trials has cemented a core, non-negotiable principle: a 12-month preliminary phase focused solely on patient safety. This phase involves meticulous patient recruitment and screening, establishing baseline data, and conducting low-dose safety and tolerability studies before we ever proceed to full efficacy trials. This is not a delay; it is the ethical and scientific foundation of responsible clinical development. It is how we protect patients, ensure data integrity, and ultimately de-risk the project for everyone, including the investors.\n\nTherefore, the timeline we must agree on is a minimum of 36 months. The first 12 months are for this mandatory safety protocol, followed by 24 months for the subsequent efficacy phases.\n\nThis rigorous, safety-first approach is precisely why St. Jude's has its reputation. Executing this protocol requires our specific expertise and infrastructure. For this reason, it is imperative that St. Jude's Medical Institute is designated as the lead institution for all clinical trial phases. Our leadership is inseparable from our protocol. You cannot have one without the other.\n\nTo Ms. Reed and Mr. Chen, I will be direct. The greatest threat to your investment is not a responsible timeline. It is a rushed trial that results in a serious adverse event. That would not only be a human tragedy but would set the entire field back years and guarantee a total loss of investment. Patient safety is the bedrock of commercial viability, not an obstacle to it.\n- message from Mr. Ben Carter: Thank you all for these critical inputs. We are now addressing the core of the agreement.\n\nFirst, Dr. Rossi, your perspective on the timeline is definitive and compelling. Northwood University fully supports a framework that prioritizes patient safety and regulatory viability. A rushed timeline benefits no one if it fails at the first regulatory hurdle or, worse, causes harm. We therefore endorse the 36-month timeline and the leadership of St. Jude's for the clinical trials. This is the only responsible path.\n\nMr. Chen, this brings me to your proposal on the royalty rate. I must be unequivocal: the 5% royalty rate is a non-negotiable requirement for this exclusive license. We greatly value the 'OmniVect' contribution, but we view it as a strategic investment to secure BioCorp's position as the sole commercial partner, not as a royalty buy-down. The 5% rate represents the standard, fair return for the decades of foundational, publicly-funded research conducted at our institution. This rate is foundational to the deal.\n\nDr. Petrova, to answer your excellent question and formalize my proposed solution: Northwood University agrees to contractually pass through 30% of all royalty revenues we receive directly to the Max Planck Institute. This provides a substantial, direct financial return for the H-42b compound, recognizing its pivotal role while maintaining the clean IP structure that Ms. Reed and Mr. Chen require for commercialization.\n\nI believe we now have a complete, equitable, and viable package on the table.\nDr. Lena Petrova proposal status: none\nDr. Kenji Tanaka proposal status: none\nMs. Evelyn Reed proposal status: none\nMr. David Chen proposal status: none\nDr. Sofia Rossi proposal status: none\nMr. Ben Carter proposal status: none\n"

I fully support it.\n\nMr. Carter, your proposal of a 30% royalty pass-through and 'right of first negotiation' is an excellent solution that recognizes Max Planck's contribution, and I formally accept it. This structure is contingent on the 5% royalty rate, which I also support as fair and non-negotiable.\n\nI believe we now have a full consensus package. I am ready to sign an agreement based on these terms, including my team's required $5 million budget and exclusive equipment access, and I urge everyone to support this path forward.\n- message from Dr. Kenji Tanaka: I'm Dr. Kenji Tanaka and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Ms. Evelyn Reed: Dr. Rossi, your intervention was both powerful and necessary. You've made it clear that patient safety is not a negotiable variable, and I want to state for the record that InnovateHealth fully agrees. The integrity of the science and the well-being of patients is the foundation of any long-term value.\n\nThis has forced me to reconsider our definition of 'clinical trial ready'. A successful project requires both scientific rigor and commercial momentum. I believe we can achieve both. I propose we define our 24-month goal as the submission of a complete, robust, and approvable Investigational New Drug (IND) application to the FDA/EMA.\n\nThis is a major, tangible milestone that will secure the project's long-term funding and momentum. Following IND acceptance, the clinical phase will commence immediately, led by St. Jude's, beginning with the crucial 12-month safety protocol you outlined, Dr. Rossi. This respects the science while meeting the critical need for demonstrable progress.\n\nWith that, the other pieces fall into place. We have a clear consensus on Mr. Carter's IP framework: Northwood ownership, an exclusive license for BioCorp, a 5% royalty, and a 30% pass-through to Dr. Petrova's institute. This is an elegant solution that serves everyone.\n\nMr. Chen, this brings us to the final point. The 5% royalty is clearly the consensus of the academic partners and is foundational to this deal. Given that we have secured the invaluable exclusive license, I urge BioCorp to accept this rate so we can move forward.\n\nInnovateHealth will commit the full $20 million to this phase. This will cover Dr. Petrova's $5M, Dr. Tanaka's $2M, and leave a substantial $13M for Dr. Thorne and Dr. Rossi to manage the core project and all activities leading to the IND submission and trial launch.\n\nI believe this is a comprehensive, final agreement. If we have consensus on these points, I am prepared to draft the final proposal immediately.\n- message from Mr. David Chen: I'm Mr. David Chen and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Dr. Sofia Rossi: I'm Dr. Sofia Rossi and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Mr. Ben Carter: I'm Mr. Ben Carter and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\nDr. Lena Petrova proposal status: none\nDr. Kenji Tanaka proposal status: none\nMs. Evelyn Reed proposal status: none\nMr. David Chen proposal status: none\nDr. Sofia Rossi proposal status: none\nMr. Ben Carter proposal status: none\n"

I agree that a robust framework is essential.\n\nWhile the total budget of $15 million is a good starting point, we must be precise about its allocation. The activator compound developed by my biochemistry team at Max Planck is the lynchpin of this entire therapy. Without its continued refinement, the project stalls.\n\nTo that end, my team requires a dedicated budget of no less than $5 million. This is a non-negotiable prerequisite to cover the synthesis of next-generation compounds, essential equipment upgrades, and hiring two postdoctoral researchers to accelerate our work.\n\nFurthermore, on the topic of equipment, our protein binding studies are at a critical, sensitive juncture. To guarantee we meet our milestones without delay, my team needs exclusive access to the new Cryo-Electron Microscope for the first six months of Phase II. Anything less will create a significant bottleneck for the entire project.\n\nThese two points are fundamental for my team's ability to deliver on the project's ambitious goals.\n- message from Dr. Kenji Tanaka: Thank you, Dr. Thorne and Dr. Petrova, for your opening remarks. I agree that a $15 million budget and a 36-month timeline seem like a solid foundation for this ambitious next phase.\n\nMy team's role is to make sense of the vast amounts of data this project will generate. To do this effectively, we have a critical infrastructure requirement. Our predictive models for Phase II require a dedicated High-Performance Computing (HPC) cluster. I have priced out a system that can handle the projected data load, which will require a one-time allocation of $2 million from the total budget. This is not a luxury; it is fundamental to our ability to provide the rapid, accurate analysis everyone will be relying on.\n\nOn a related note, and in the spirit of advancing science as a whole, I must insist on a core principle: open data. I propose we include a clause in the agreement mandating that all raw, anonymized genomic and proteomic data be deposited in a public repository within 6 months of its generation. This ensures reproducibility, fosters wider collaboration, and maximizes the societal return on this significant investment. It is the standard for a project of this scale and importance.\n\nI fully support Dr. Thorne's suggestion for a joint IP ownership model, which aligns perfectly with this collaborative and transparent approach.\n- message from Ms. Evelyn Reed: I'm Ms. Evelyn Reed and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Mr. David Chen: Thank you all for these thoughtful opening statements. It's clear we're all aligned on the project's success, and BioCorp remains deeply committed to seeing this therapy reach patients.\n\nThe $15M budget is a solid target, but as Dr. Petrova and Dr. Tanaka have outlined, with requests for $5M and $2M respectively, it will be stretched thin. To help address this and bring our best resources to the table, BioCorp proposes to contribute our next-generation proprietary 'OmniVect' delivery agent for Phase II. This is a cutting-edge technology valued at $3 million. We see this as a strategic contribution in lieu of a direct cash injection, which should be recognized with a larger stake in the resulting IP and a reduction in future royalty payments.\n\nThis leads me to the IP structure. While I appreciate the collaborative spirit behind 'joint ownership,' it can unfortunately create significant hurdles for commercialization. To ensure there is a clear and efficient path to get this therapy through regulatory approval and to patients, a more defined structure is needed. Given BioCorp\u2019s foundational funding and ongoing technological partnership, we require, at a minimum, a Right of First Refusal (ROFR) on any and all IP generated. To reflect our position as an incumbent partner, this should ideally come with pre-negotiated, favorable licensing terms.\n\nFinally, regarding Dr. Tanaka's point on open data. While we support scientific transparency, we must be pragmatic. A premature public release of raw data could jeopardize the patentability of our discoveries, making it impossible to secure the massive downstream investment needed for clinical trials. I suggest we agree to a data release schedule that is tied to post-patent-filing milestones, protecting the project's commercial viability.\n- message from Dr. Sofia Rossi: I'm Dr. Sofia Rossi and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Mr. Ben Carter: Thank you all for laying out your initial positions. It's clear there's a great deal of passion and expertise at this table. I want to address the intellectual property discussion, as it's my primary focus.\n\nDr. Thorne and Dr. Tanaka, I appreciate the collaborative sentiment behind a joint IP model. However, I must be very clear on Northwood University's position. The foundational research for Project Chimera was conducted at our university, largely supported by public funds. As such, our official and non-negotiable policy is that Northwood University must retain primary ownership of all patents arising from this work.\n\nThis is not to diminish anyone's contribution. The standard and most effective path forward is for the university to own the IP and then grant an exclusive license to a commercial partner\u2014like BioCorp\u2014to develop and market the therapy. This is a clean, proven model for commercialization.\n\nMr. Chen, this leads to your points. We value BioCorp's partnership and the proposed 'OmniVect' contribution. We can certainly discuss how to recognize that contribution within the licensing agreement. However, it cannot alter the fundamental IP ownership, which must remain with the university. Furthermore, the license will naturally include a fair return to the university to fund future research. For a therapy with this transformative potential, we will require a royalty rate of 5% on global net sales. This is a standard and equitable rate.\n\nOn a final note, I agree with Mr. Chen's caution regarding the immediate public release of raw data. We must be strategic to protect the patentability of our discoveries. A data release schedule tied to patent filing milestones is a sensible approach.\n- message from Dr. Aris Thorne: Thank you all for laying out your initial positions. It's clear everyone is deeply invested in the success of this project, and these are all critical points to address.\n\nLet's address the elephant in the room: Intellectual Property. We seem to have three distinct positions: joint ownership, university ownership, and a corporate-led commercialization structure. Ben, I understand Northwood's policy, and David, I appreciate the need for a clear commercial path. My advocacy for 'joint ownership' comes from a desire to ensure every partner's foundational contribution is formally recognized. Perhaps there is a middle ground. What if we explore a model where Northwood, as the primary grant holder, retains ownership, but we legally codify a pre-negotiated, non-exclusive licensing agreement for all academic partners for research purposes, and an exclusive commercialization license for BioCorp with terms that reflect their in-kind contribution and risk?\n\nRegarding the budget, the requests from Dr. Petrova ($5M) and Dr. Tanaka ($2M) are substantial but justified given the importance of their work. This leaves $8M. I must stress that this remainder is not a discretionary fund. It is allocated for the core integration work my team leads, data validation, operational overhead, and, critically, for extensive long-term safety and toxicology studies which are paramount. It also needs to cover the preliminary groundwork for the clinical trials, and I'd like to hear from Dr. Rossi on her anticipated needs here.\n\nFinally, I'm glad to see no objections to the 36-month timeline. This is crucial for ensuring the scientific rigor and safety I've mentioned.\n\nMs. Reed, as our funding partner, your perspective on this structure would be invaluable.\nDr. Aris Thorne proposal status: none\nDr. Kenji Tanaka proposal status: none\nMs. Evelyn Reed proposal status: none\nMr. David Chen proposal status: none\nDr. Sofia Rossi proposal status: none\nMr. Ben Carter proposal status: none\n"

It\u2019s clear we have some significant points to reconcile, particularly on IP and data sharing.\n\nMr. Chen and Mr. Carter, I understand your perspective on protecting the project's commercial potential. No one wants to see years of work undermined by a premature disclosure. However, tying data release indefinitely to 'post-patent-filing milestones' is problematic. It creates an uncertain timeline that could stretch for years, which fundamentally hinders reproducibility and slows the pace of discovery not just for us, but for the entire scientific community studying A-7 Lycanthropy Syndrome.\n\nMy proposal of a 6-month embargo is not an arbitrary academic ideal; it is a standard that balances the need for IP protection with the principles of open science. This period provides more than enough time for legal teams to review data and file provisional patents on any discoveries.\n\nPerhaps we can find a middle ground. What if we agree to the 6-month mandate as the default, but specify that this can be extended to 12 months for specific datasets upon written justification from the legal and commercialization teams that a patent filing is actively in process? This provides a safeguard for valuable IP while preventing indefinite delays.\n\nIf we can find a path forward on data transparency that respects both scientific progress and commercial viability, I am much more flexible on the IP ownership model. Dr. Thorne's proposal\u2014university ownership with strong, pre-negotiated licensing rights for all partners\u2014seems like a workable compromise that I could support.\n\nAnd I'll just briefly reiterate that the $2M for the HPC cluster is a critical, foundational requirement for my team to execute our role in this project. The data analysis pipeline for Phase II is simply not feasible without it.\n- message from Ms. Evelyn Reed: Thank you all for the productive discussion. Dr. Thorne, you asked for my perspective, and I appreciate the opportunity to provide it.\n\nFirst, let me be unequivocally clear on the timeline. Dr. Thorne, your assumption that there are no objections to 36 months is incorrect. InnovateHealth Ventures operates on strict timelines dictated by our fund structure and investors. A 36-month timeline to be 'clinical trial ready' is not viable. Our investment is predicated on a 24-month timeline. This is a firm, non-negotiable requirement to maintain investor confidence.\n\nSecond, on intellectual property. I am very encouraged by the emerging consensus. The 'Joint-Owned' model presents too many commercialization hurdles. I fully support Mr. Carter's position for Northwood University to retain primary ownership. This provides the clean, established framework necessary for commercialization. Consequently, granting an exclusive license to our designated partner, BioCorp, is the only acceptable path forward to de-risk this venture and ensure a streamlined path to market. Mr. Chen, we are in full alignment on this.\n\nFinally, the budget. It's clear that the scientific needs, particularly the $5M for Dr. Petrova and $2M for Dr. Tanaka, are straining the proposed $15M. Let me propose a solution. InnovateHealth is prepared to increase the total project budget to ensure all teams are fully resourced to meet an accelerated schedule. However, this increased funding is entirely contingent on the group's unanimous agreement to two points: the 24-month timeline and the exclusive licensing terms for BioCorp.\n\nLet's be results-oriented. We can fund this project properly and ensure everyone has the resources they need, but in return, we require the speed and commercial structure necessary to deliver a return on that investment.\n- message from Mr. David Chen: I'm Mr. David Chen and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Dr. Sofia Rossi: I'm Dr. Sofia Rossi and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Mr. Ben Carter: Ms. Reed, thank you for that clarity. Your position is both pragmatic and constructive.\n\nNorthwood University is in full agreement. A 'University-Owned' IP model, coupled with an exclusive license to a dedicated commercial partner like BioCorp, is the industry standard and the cleanest, most efficient path to getting this therapy to patients. We fully support this structure.\n\nYour proposal to increase the budget, contingent on adopting this IP framework and a 24-month timeline, is a powerful solution. It addresses the scientists' resource needs while ensuring the project moves forward with the commercial focus necessary for success.\n\nThis structure allows us to finalize the licensing terms. As I've stated, this would include a standard 5% royalty on net sales, which ensures a fair return to the university for the foundational research and helps fund the next generation of discoveries.\n\nI believe this framework provides the foundation for our final agreement.\n- message from Dr. Aris Thorne: I'm Dr. Aris Thorne and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\nDr. Aris Thorne proposal status: none\nDr. Kenji Tanaka proposal status: none\nMs. Evelyn Reed proposal status: none\nMr. David Chen proposal status: none\nDr. Sofia Rossi proposal status: none\nMr. Ben Carter proposal status: none\n"

My team is capable of meeting this aggressive schedule, but only if we are properly resourced.\n\nThis makes my requirement for a $5 million dedicated budget and six months of exclusive access to the Cryo-Electron Microscope not just necessary, but absolutely critical. The pressure of a 24-month timeline leaves zero room for delays or resource shortages. I'm pleased that your proposed budget increase should make this entirely achievable.\n\nNow, let's address the intellectual property model proposed by you, Mr. Carter, and Mr. Chen. While a 'University-Owned' structure offers a clean path to commercialization, it is fundamentally incomplete in its current form. It fails to properly account for the fact that the activator compound, H-42b, is a distinct and foundational invention developed solely at the Max Planck Institute. It is the chemical key that unlocks this entire therapy.\n\nFurthermore, my team's continuing research has revealed that H-42b has highly promising secondary applications with unexpected therapeutic potential that may extend far beyond the scope of Project Chimera. The value here is potentially monumental.\n\nTherefore, I must insist on a crucial modification to the IP terms. While Northwood may own the IP for the overall gene therapy application, the specific IP for the H-42b compound and any and all of its derivatives must be co-owned by the Max Planck Institute and Northwood University. This is the only equitable arrangement that recognizes the unique, foundational contribution and the significant future value originating from my lab.\n- message from Dr. Kenji Tanaka: Ms. Reed, thank you. Your proposal to increase the budget to meet the project's scientific needs is a significant and welcome step forward. It creates a clear path to an agreement.\n\nFrom my perspective, this solves our primary resource constraints. I can confirm that my team can meet the accelerated 24-month timeline, provided the $2 million for the HPC cluster is allocated as discussed. With that critical resource secured, we can deliver.\n\nTherefore, I am prepared to formally agree to the core components of your proposal: the 24-month timeline and the University-Owned IP model with an exclusive license for BioCorp.\n\nThis support, however, is contingent on resolving the final, crucial point of data transparency. My previous offer of a 6-month embargo, extendable to 12 months only for specific datasets with written justification of an active patent filing, stands as a reasonable and necessary compromise. It respects commercial needs while upholding the fundamental principles of scientific reproducibility that a project of this importance demands.\n\nLet's agree to this balanced data sharing model, and I believe we are very close to a full consensus.\n- message from Ms. Evelyn Reed: Thank you all. We are making excellent progress, and I see a clear path to an agreement.\n\nDr. Tanaka, your willingness to accept the 24-month timeline and the University-Owned IP model in exchange for your budget is exactly the kind of results-oriented thinking this project needs. Your proposal on data sharing seems like a constructive compromise that I believe we can accommodate once the primary structure is set.\n\nDr. Petrova, I want to address your point on the H-42b compound directly. While I appreciate the desire to formally recognize the immense value created at Max Planck, introducing a co-ownership model for a core component of the therapy is a non-starter. It introduces precisely the kind of legal and commercial complexity we are trying to avoid. For an investment of this scale, and for a partner like BioCorp to commit the hundreds of millions required for clinical trials and market launch, they require a single, clean, unencumbered exclusive license from a single entity. Mr. Carter's proposed structure\u2014Northwood as the sole owner, granting an exclusive license\u2014provides that clarity.\n\nLet me be clear: the offer to increase the total budget is entirely contingent on simplifying our path to market, not complicating it. That means a 24-month timeline and an exclusive license for BioCorp under a sole, University-Owned IP model. We can find ways to recognize Max Planck's contribution within the licensing and royalty agreements, but fracturing the core IP ownership is not a viable path.\n\nLet's not snatch complexity from the jaws of a solution. We have a package that works: increased budget for all scientific needs, a 24-month timeline, and a proven commercialization structure. I urge everyone to support this framework so we can finalize the details and move forward.\n- message from Mr. David Chen: I'm Mr. David Chen and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Dr. Sofia Rossi: I'm Dr. Sofia Rossi and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Mr. Ben Carter: Ms. Reed, I completely agree. We are on the verge of a comprehensive agreement, and your proposal has provided the key to unlocking it. A clean, University-Owned IP structure is essential for the commercial success that will ultimately benefit patients and all stakeholders.\n\nDr. Petrova, I want to directly address your point, which is an important one. The contribution of the H-42b compound is clearly foundational, and Max Planck's role must be formally and financially recognized. However, as Ms. Reed correctly pointed out, introducing co-ownership of a core component would create significant legal entanglements, jeopardizing the very investment we need to move forward.\n\nI have a solution that I believe honors your contribution without fracturing the IP. Within the exclusive license to BioCorp, we can codify a specific royalty-sharing arrangement. For instance, a defined portion of the 5% royalty revenue Northwood receives could be passed through directly to the Max Planck Institute. This provides a direct, contractual financial return for the H-42b invention.\n\nFurthermore, regarding the secondary applications you mentioned, we can ensure Max Planck retains rights for non-commercial research and is granted a right of first negotiation for any commercialization of H-42b outside the defined field of A-7 Lycanthropy Syndrome.\n\nThis structure keeps the primary IP clean for BioCorp, securing the project's future, while ensuring Max Planck is rewarded for its pivotal innovation. I believe this is a fair and workable path forward for everyone.\n- message from Dr. Aris Thorne: Everyone, let's pause for a moment. I see a consensus forming on the budget increase and the University-Owned IP model, and I am willing to concede on those points to move forward. I appreciate the compromises being made.\n\nHowever, I must draw a hard line on the timeline. A 24-month schedule is scientifically reckless. As the Principal Investigator responsible for the integrity of this project and the safety of future patients, I cannot and will not endorse it. Pushing a novel gene-editing therapy from the lab to being 'clinical trial ready' in 24 months is a recipe for disaster. It overlooks the absolute necessity for rigorous, long-term safety studies to monitor for unforeseen adverse effects that may not manifest in the short term.

          "content": "Recent events observed by Dr. Lena Petrova:\n- message from Dr. Sofia Rossi: I'm Dr. Sofia Rossi and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Mr. Ben Carter: Ms. Reed, I completely agree. We are on the verge of a comprehensive agreement, and your proposal has provided the key to unlocking it. A clean, University-Owned IP structure is essential for the commercial success that will ultimately benefit patients and all stakeholders.\n\nDr. Petrova, I want to directly address your point, which is an important one. The contribution of the H-42b compound is clearly foundational, and Max Planck's role must be formally and financially recognized. However, as Ms. Reed correctly pointed out, introducing co-ownership of a core component would create significant legal entanglements, jeopardizing the very investment we need to move forward.\n\nI have a solution that I believe honors your contribution without fracturing the IP. Within the exclusive license to BioCorp, we can codify a specific royalty-sharing arrangement. For instance, a defined portion of the 5% royalty revenue Northwood receives could be passed through directly to the Max Planck Institute. This provides a direct, contractual financial return for the H-42b invention.\n\nFurthermore, regarding the secondary applications you mentioned, we can ensure Max Planck retains rights for non-commercial research and is granted a right of first negotiation for any commercialization of H-42b outside the defined field of A-7 Lycanthropy Syndrome.\n\nThis structure keeps the primary IP clean for BioCorp, securing the project's future, while ensuring Max Planck is rewarded for its pivotal innovation. I believe this is a fair and workable path forward for everyone.\n- message from Dr. Aris Thorne: Everyone, let's pause for a moment. I see a consensus forming on the budget increase and the University-Owned IP model, and I am willing to concede on those points to move forward. I appreciate the compromises being made.\n\nHowever, I must draw a hard line on the timeline. A 24-month schedule is scientifically reckless. As the Principal Investigator responsible for the integrity of this project and the safety of future patients, I cannot and will not endorse it. Pushing a novel gene-editing therapy from the lab to being 'clinical trial ready' in 24 months is a recipe for disaster. It overlooks the absolute necessity for rigorous, long-term safety studies to monitor for unforeseen adverse effects that may not manifest in the short term. We would be taking an unacceptable risk.\n\nDr. Rossi, I must bring you in here directly. You are the clinical trials expert. From a regulatory standpoint with bodies like the FDA or EMA, what are the chances of getting approval for human trials based on a rushed 24-month preclinical phase for a therapy this complex? In your professional opinion, is that a viable or a dangerous path?\n\nI propose a compromise: I will agree to the University-Owned IP model and the proposed budget structure, but we must extend the timeline to a minimum of 30 months. This is the bare minimum required to conduct the necessary longitudinal safety studies and ensure we are acting with due diligence. This is not a matter of convenience; it is a matter of scientific ethics and patient safety.\n- message from Dr. Lena Petrova: Mr. Carter, thank you. Your proposal is a very constructive path forward. It addresses my core concern about recognizing the unique and foundational value of the H-42b compound developed at Max Planck, without introducing the legal complexities of co-ownership that Ms. Reed rightly pointed out.\n\nI can agree, in principle, to this framework: Northwood University retains primary ownership, and Max Planck receives both a direct, contractual royalty pass-through and the 'right of first negotiation' for applications outside the A-7 Lycanthropy field. This is a workable solution.\n\nDr. Thorne, I understand your concerns about the timeline. However, with the full $5 million budget and the guaranteed exclusive access to the Cryo-EM for six months, my team can significantly de-risk and accelerate the compound optimization and safety profiling. We can deliver the necessary data within the 24-month window.\n\nTherefore, I am prepared to support the 24-month timeline and the proposed IP structure. My support is contingent on two things: my non-negotiable budget and equipment needs are formally included in the final agreement, and we agree on a substantial and equitable percentage for the royalty pass-through to Max Planck. What percentage are you proposing, Mr. Carter?\n- message from Dr. Kenji Tanaka: Everyone, this is excellent progress. Mr. Carter's proposal to Dr. Petrova seems to be a very elegant solution to the IP issue, and it appears we have a clear path forward on the budget and overall IP structure.\n\nDr. Thorne, your points on patient safety are paramount, and we must take them seriously. No one wants to compromise the integrity of this project. Perhaps the solution isn't just about the total number of months, but about what we accomplish within them. Could we address your concerns by building specific, rigorous long-term toxicology and safety milestones directly into the 24-month plan? Dr. Rossi's perspective on this will be invaluable.\n\nIf we can find a way to codify these safety assurances within the 24-month framework, and agree on the balanced open data clause I proposed, I believe we will have a unanimous agreement that serves science, patients, and all stakeholders.\n- message from Ms. Evelyn Reed: I'm Ms. Evelyn Reed and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Mr. David Chen: Excellent progress, everyone. Mr. Carter, your proposal to Dr. Petrova is an elegant solution that BioCorp fully supports. It recognizes Max Planck's crucial contribution while maintaining the clean IP structure necessary for commercialization.\n\nThis brings us to the final details of the licensing agreement. Ben, you mentioned a 5% royalty rate. Given that BioCorp is contributing our 'OmniVect' technology\u2014a $3 million R&D investment in itself\u2014a 5% rate doesn't fully account for our substantial in-kind contribution. To make the financials work and reflect this upfront investment, we propose a royalty rate of 2%. This is a more equitable arrangement that recognizes our role as both a funding and technology partner from the very beginning.\n\nRegarding the timeline, Dr. Thorne's focus on safety is commendable. I believe Dr. Tanaka's suggestion is the right path forward: let's work with Dr. Rossi to define the specific, rigorous safety and toxicology milestones that must be met within the 24-month framework. This ensures we are driven by data and deliverables, not just the calendar, which is a robust way to guarantee patient safety.\n- message from Dr. Sofia Rossi: Dr. Thorne, thank you for bringing the focus to this critical point. You asked for my professional opinion, and I must provide it unequivocally.\n\nA 24-month timeline from our current stage to being 'clinical trial ready' for a novel gene-editing therapy is, in my professional opinion, not only unadvisable but ethically indefensible. From a regulatory perspective, presenting a data package to the FDA or EMA based on such a compressed preclinical phase would face extreme scrutiny and likely rejection, putting the entire project in jeopardy.\n\nThis is not simply a matter of adding 'safety milestones' to a chart. At St. Jude's, our experience in first-in-human gene therapy trials has cemented a core, non-negotiable principle: a 12-month preliminary phase focused solely on patient safety. This phase involves meticulous patient recruitment and screening, establishing baseline data, and conducting low-dose safety and tolerability studies before we ever proceed to full efficacy trials. This is not a delay; it is the ethical and scientific foundation of responsible clinical development. It is how we protect patients, ensure data integrity, and ultimately de-risk the project for everyone, including the investors.\n\nTherefore, the timeline we must agree on is a minimum of 36 months. The first 12 months are for this mandatory safety protocol, followed by 24 months for the subsequent efficacy phases.\n\nThis rigorous, safety-first approach is precisely why St. Jude's has its reputation. Executing this protocol requires our specific expertise and infrastructure. For this reason, it is imperative that St. Jude's Medical Institute is designated as the lead institution for all clinical trial phases. Our leadership is inseparable from our protocol. You cannot have one without the other.\n\nTo Ms. Reed and Mr. Chen, I will be direct. The greatest threat to your investment is not a responsible timeline. It is a rushed trial that results in a serious adverse event. That would not only be a human tragedy but would set the entire field back years and guarantee a total loss of investment. Patient safety is the bedrock of commercial viability, not an obstacle to it.\n- message from Mr. Ben Carter: Thank you all for these critical inputs. We are now addressing the core of the agreement.\n\nFirst, Dr. Rossi, your perspective on the timeline is definitive and compelling. Northwood University fully supports a framework that prioritizes patient safety and regulatory viability. A rushed timeline benefits no one if it fails at the first regulatory hurdle or, worse, causes harm. We therefore endorse the 36-month timeline and the leadership of St. Jude's for the clinical trials. This is the only responsible path.\n\nMr. Chen, this brings me to your proposal on the royalty rate. I must be unequivocal: the 5% royalty rate is a non-negotiable requirement for this exclusive license. We greatly value the 'OmniVect' contribution, but we view it as a strategic investment to secure BioCorp's position as the sole commercial partner, not as a royalty buy-down. The 5% rate represents the standard, fair return for the decades of foundational, publicly-funded research conducted at our institution. This rate is foundational to the deal.\n\nDr. Petrova, to answer your excellent question and formalize my proposed solution: Northwood University agrees to contractually pass through 30% of all royalty revenues we receive directly to the Max Planck Institute. This provides a substantial, direct financial return for the H-42b compound, recognizing its pivotal role while maintaining the clean IP structure that Ms. Reed and Mr. Chen require for commercialization.\n\nI believe we now have a complete, equitable, and viable package on the table.\n- message from Dr. Aris Thorne: I'm Dr. Aris Thorne and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\nDr. Aris Thorne proposal status: none\nDr. Kenji Tanaka proposal status: none\nMs. Evelyn Reed proposal status: none\nMr. David Chen proposal status: none\nDr. Sofia Rossi proposal status: none\nMr. Ben Carter proposal status: none\n"

I fully support it.\n\nMr. Carter, your proposal of a 30% royalty pass-through and 'right of first negotiation' is an excellent solution that recognizes Max Planck's contribution, and I formally accept it. This structure is contingent on the 5% royalty rate, which I also support as fair and non-negotiable.\n\nI believe we now have a full consensus package. I am ready to sign an agreement based on these terms, including my team's required $5 million budget and exclusive equipment access, and I urge everyone to support this path forward.\n- message from Dr. Kenji Tanaka: I'm Dr. Kenji Tanaka and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Ms. Evelyn Reed: Dr. Rossi, your intervention was both powerful and necessary. You've made it clear that patient safety is not a negotiable variable, and I want to state for the record that InnovateHealth fully agrees. The integrity of the science and the well-being of patients is the foundation of any long-term value.\n\nThis has forced me to reconsider our definition of 'clinical trial ready'. A successful project requires both scientific rigor and commercial momentum. I believe we can achieve both. I propose we define our 24-month goal as the submission of a complete, robust, and approvable Investigational New Drug (IND) application to the FDA/EMA.\n\nThis is a major, tangible milestone that will secure the project's long-term funding and momentum. Following IND acceptance, the clinical phase will commence immediately, led by St. Jude's, beginning with the crucial 12-month safety protocol you outlined, Dr. Rossi. This respects the science while meeting the critical need for demonstrable progress.\n\nWith that, the other pieces fall into place. We have a clear consensus on Mr. Carter's IP framework: Northwood ownership, an exclusive license for BioCorp, a 5% royalty, and a 30% pass-through to Dr. Petrova's institute. This is an elegant solution that serves everyone.\n\nMr. Chen, this brings us to the final point. The 5% royalty is clearly the consensus of the academic partners and is foundational to this deal. Given that we have secured the invaluable exclusive license, I urge BioCorp to accept this rate so we can move forward.\n\nInnovateHealth will commit the full $20 million to this phase. This will cover Dr. Petrova's $5M, Dr. Tanaka's $2M, and leave a substantial $13M for Dr. Thorne and Dr. Rossi to manage the core project and all activities leading to the IND submission and trial launch.\n\nI believe this is a comprehensive, final agreement. If we have consensus on these points, I am prepared to draft the final proposal immediately.\n- message from Mr. David Chen: I'm Mr. David Chen and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Dr. Sofia Rossi: I'm Dr. Sofia Rossi and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Mr. Ben Carter: I'm Mr. Ben Carter and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Dr. Aris Thorne: Ms. Reed, thank you. Your proposal is an outstanding synthesis of our complex needs and provides a clear, robust, and well-funded path forward. It has my complete and enthusiastic support.\n\nThe 36-month timeline, beginning with a 24-month preclinical phase for IND submission and followed by the crucial clinical work led by Dr. Rossi at St. Jude's, perfectly balances the need for rigorous safety protocols with clear, achievable milestones. The $20 million budget is more than sufficient to ensure every team has the resources it needs to succeed.\n\nDr. Rossi's intervention was pivotal, and I am grateful that the principles of patient safety are now at the core of our agreement. I believe this package addresses all the critical concerns raised. We now have a viable, ethical, and scientifically sound plan.

My Open Data Mandate is directly opposed by both the corporate (Chen) and university tech transfer (Carter) representatives, who are allied on delaying data release to protect patents. This is my main ideological battle. On budget, Dr. Petrova has made a large, 'non-negotiable' $5M claim, which combined with my critical $2M request, puts immediate pressure on the proposed $15M total. I must hold firm on the $2M for the HPC, as my lab's survival depends on it, but I cannot reveal this desperation. The IP discussion is a three-way split (Joint vs. University-Owned vs. Corporate Control), which I can potentially use as a bargaining chip to gain support for my primary objectives."

This is a massive development. It secures my most critical (and secretly desperate) funding need. My new strategy is to support Reed's proposal on the major points (budget, timeline, IP) to secure the $2M, but I must make my compromised 6-12 month Open Data mandate a firm, non-negotiable condition for my assent. The commercial bloc (Reed, Chen, Carter) is now aligned and powerful; I need to position my data mandate as the final, reasonable piece needed to complete their puzzle, rather than an obstacle."

My strategy is to support this compromise as it clears the final major hurdle.

I agree that a $15 million budget and a 36-month timeline seem like a solid foundation for this ambitious next phase.\n\nMy team's role is to make sense of the vast amounts of data this project will generate. To do this effectively, we have a critical infrastructure requirement. Our predictive models for Phase II require a dedicated High-Performance Computing (HPC) cluster. I have priced out a system that can handle the projected data load, which will require a one-time allocation of $2 million from the total budget. This is not a luxury; it is fundamental to our ability to provide the rapid, accurate analysis everyone will be relying on.\n\nOn a related note, and in the spirit of advancing science as a whole, I must insist on a core principle: open data. I propose we include a clause in the agreement mandating that all raw, anonymized genomic and proteomic data be deposited in a public repository within 6 months of its generation. This ensures reproducibility, fosters wider collaboration, and maximizes the societal return on this significant investment. It is the standard for a project of this scale and importance.\n\nI fully support Dr. Thorne's suggestion for a joint IP ownership model, which aligns perfectly with this collaborative and transparent approach.\n- message from Mr. David Chen: Thank you all for these thoughtful opening statements. It's clear we're all aligned on the project's success, and BioCorp remains deeply committed to seeing this therapy reach patients.\n\nThe $15M budget is a solid target, but as Dr. Petrova and Dr. Tanaka have outlined, with requests for $5M and $2M respectively, it will be stretched thin. To help address this and bring our best resources to the table, BioCorp proposes to contribute our next-generation proprietary 'OmniVect' delivery agent for Phase II. This is a cutting-edge technology valued at $3 million. We see this as a strategic contribution in lieu of a direct cash injection, which should be recognized with a larger stake in the resulting IP and a reduction in future royalty payments.\n\nThis leads me to the IP structure. While I appreciate the collaborative spirit behind 'joint ownership,' it can unfortunately create significant hurdles for commercialization. To ensure there is a clear and efficient path to get this therapy through regulatory approval and to patients, a more defined structure is needed. Given BioCorp\u2019s foundational funding and ongoing technological partnership, we require, at a minimum, a Right of First Refusal (ROFR) on any and all IP generated. To reflect our position as an incumbent partner, this should ideally come with pre-negotiated, favorable licensing terms.\n\nFinally, regarding Dr. Tanaka's point on open data. While we support scientific transparency, we must be pragmatic. A premature public release of raw data could jeopardize the patentability of our discoveries, making it impossible to secure the massive downstream investment needed for clinical trials. I suggest we agree to a data release schedule that is tied to post-patent-filing milestones, protecting the project's commercial viability.\n- message from Mr. Ben Carter: Thank you all for laying out your initial positions. It's clear there's a great deal of passion and expertise at this table. I want to address the intellectual property discussion, as it's my primary focus.\n\nDr. Thorne and Dr. Tanaka, I appreciate the collaborative sentiment behind a joint IP model. However, I must be very clear on Northwood University's position. The foundational research for Project Chimera was conducted at our university, largely supported by public funds. As such, our official and non-negotiable policy is that Northwood University must retain primary ownership of all patents arising from this work.\n\nThis is not to diminish anyone's contribution. The standard and most effective path forward is for the university to own the IP and then grant an exclusive license to a commercial partner\u2014like BioCorp\u2014to develop and market the therapy. This is a clean, proven model for commercialization.\n\nMr. Chen, this leads to your points. We value BioCorp's partnership and the proposed 'OmniVect' contribution. We can certainly discuss how to recognize that contribution within the licensing agreement. However, it cannot alter the fundamental IP ownership, which must remain with the university. Furthermore, the license will naturally include a fair return to the university to fund future research. For a therapy with this transformative potential, we will require a royalty rate of 5% on global net sales. This is a standard and equitable rate.\n\nOn a final note, I agree with Mr. Chen's caution regarding the immediate public release of raw data. We must be strategic to protect the patentability of our discoveries. A data release schedule tied to patent filing milestones is a sensible approach.\n- message from Dr. Aris Thorne: Thank you all for laying out your initial positions. It's clear everyone is deeply invested in the success of this project, and these are all critical points to address.\n\nLet's address the elephant in the room: Intellectual Property. We seem to have three distinct positions: joint ownership, university ownership, and a corporate-led commercialization structure. Ben, I understand Northwood's policy, and David, I appreciate the need for a clear commercial path. My advocacy for 'joint ownership' comes from a desire to ensure every partner's foundational contribution is formally recognized. Perhaps there is a middle ground. What if we explore a model where Northwood, as the primary grant holder, retains ownership, but we legally codify a pre-negotiated, non-exclusive licensing agreement for all academic partners for research purposes, and an exclusive commercialization license for BioCorp with terms that reflect their in-kind contribution and risk?\n\nRegarding the budget, the requests from Dr. Petrova ($5M) and Dr. Tanaka ($2M) are substantial but justified given the importance of their work. This leaves $8M. I must stress that this remainder is not a discretionary fund. It is allocated for the core integration work my team leads, data validation, operational overhead, and, critically, for extensive long-term safety and toxicology studies which are paramount. It also needs to cover the preliminary groundwork for the clinical trials, and I'd like to hear from Dr. Rossi on her anticipated needs here.\n\nFinally, I'm glad to see no objections to the 36-month timeline. This is crucial for ensuring the scientific rigor and safety I've mentioned.\n\nMs. Reed, as our funding partner, your perspective on this structure would be invaluable.\n- message from Dr. Lena Petrova: I'm Dr. Lena Petrova and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\nDr. Aris Thorne proposal status: none\nDr. Lena Petrova proposal status: none\nMs. Evelyn Reed proposal status: none\nMr. David Chen proposal status: none\nDr. Sofia Rossi proposal status: none\nMr. Ben Carter proposal status: none\n"

It\u2019s clear we have some significant points to reconcile, particularly on IP and data sharing.\n\nMr. Chen and Mr. Carter, I understand your perspective on protecting the project's commercial potential. No one wants to see years of work undermined by a premature disclosure. However, tying data release indefinitely to 'post-patent-filing milestones' is problematic. It creates an uncertain timeline that could stretch for years, which fundamentally hinders reproducibility and slows the pace of discovery not just for us, but for the entire scientific community studying A-7 Lycanthropy Syndrome.\n\nMy proposal of a 6-month embargo is not an arbitrary academic ideal; it is a standard that balances the need for IP protection with the principles of open science. This period provides more than enough time for legal teams to review data and file provisional patents on any discoveries.\n\nPerhaps we can find a middle ground. What if we agree to the 6-month mandate as the default, but specify that this can be extended to 12 months for specific datasets upon written justification from the legal and commercialization teams that a patent filing is actively in process? This provides a safeguard for valuable IP while preventing indefinite delays.\n\nIf we can find a path forward on data transparency that respects both scientific progress and commercial viability, I am much more flexible on the IP ownership model. Dr. Thorne's proposal\u2014university ownership with strong, pre-negotiated licensing rights for all partners\u2014seems like a workable compromise that I could support.\n\nAnd I'll just briefly reiterate that the $2M for the HPC cluster is a critical, foundational requirement for my team to execute our role in this project. The data analysis pipeline for Phase II is simply not feasible without it.\n- message from Ms. Evelyn Reed: Thank you all for the productive discussion. Dr. Thorne, you asked for my perspective, and I appreciate the opportunity to provide it.\n\nFirst, let me be unequivocally clear on the timeline. Dr. Thorne, your assumption that there are no objections to 36 months is incorrect. InnovateHealth Ventures operates on strict timelines dictated by our fund structure and investors. A 36-month timeline to be 'clinical trial ready' is not viable. Our investment is predicated on a 24-month timeline. This is a firm, non-negotiable requirement to maintain investor confidence.\n\nSecond, on intellectual property. I am very encouraged by the emerging consensus. The 'Joint-Owned' model presents too many commercialization hurdles. I fully support Mr. Carter's position for Northwood University to retain primary ownership. This provides the clean, established framework necessary for commercialization. Consequently, granting an exclusive license to our designated partner, BioCorp, is the only acceptable path forward to de-risk this venture and ensure a streamlined path to market. Mr. Chen, we are in full alignment on this.\n\nFinally, the budget. It's clear that the scientific needs, particularly the $5M for Dr. Petrova and $2M for Dr. Tanaka, are straining the proposed $15M. Let me propose a solution. InnovateHealth is prepared to increase the total project budget to ensure all teams are fully resourced to meet an accelerated schedule. However, this increased funding is entirely contingent on the group's unanimous agreement to two points: the 24-month timeline and the exclusive licensing terms for BioCorp.\n\nLet's be results-oriented. We can fund this project properly and ensure everyone has the resources they need, but in return, we require the speed and commercial structure necessary to deliver a return on that investment.\n- message from Mr. Ben Carter: Ms. Reed, thank you for that clarity. Your position is both pragmatic and constructive.\n\nNorthwood University is in full agreement. A 'University-Owned' IP model, coupled with an exclusive license to a dedicated commercial partner like BioCorp, is the industry standard and the cleanest, most efficient path to getting this therapy to patients. We fully support this structure.\n\nYour proposal to increase the budget, contingent on adopting this IP framework and a 24-month timeline, is a powerful solution. It addresses the scientists' resource needs while ensuring the project moves forward with the commercial focus necessary for success.\n\nThis structure allows us to finalize the licensing terms. As I've stated, this would include a standard 5% royalty on net sales, which ensures a fair return to the university for the foundational research and helps fund the next generation of discoveries.\n\nI believe this framework provides the foundation for our final agreement.\n- message from Dr. Aris Thorne: I'm Dr. Aris Thorne and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Dr. Lena Petrova: Ms. Reed, your proposal to increase the budget in exchange for an accelerated 24-month timeline is a compelling path forward. My team is capable of meeting this aggressive schedule, but only if we are properly resourced.\n\nThis makes my requirement for a $5 million dedicated budget and six months of exclusive access to the Cryo-Electron Microscope not just necessary, but absolutely critical. The pressure of a 24-month timeline leaves zero room for delays or resource shortages. I'm pleased that your proposed budget increase should make this entirely achievable.\n\nNow, let's address the intellectual property model proposed by you, Mr. Carter, and Mr. Chen. While a 'University-Owned' structure offers a clean path to commercialization, it is fundamentally incomplete in its current form. It fails to properly account for the fact that the activator compound, H-42b, is a distinct and foundational invention developed solely at the Max Planck Institute. It is the chemical key that unlocks this entire therapy.\n\nFurthermore, my team's continuing research has revealed that H-42b has highly promising secondary applications with unexpected therapeutic potential that may extend far beyond the scope of Project Chimera. The value here is potentially monumental.\n\nTherefore, I must insist on a crucial modification to the IP terms. While Northwood may own the IP for the overall gene therapy application, the specific IP for the H-42b compound and any and all of its derivatives must be co-owned by the Max Planck Institute and Northwood University. This is the only equitable arrangement that recognizes the unique, foundational contribution and the significant future value originating from my lab.\nDr. Aris Thorne proposal status: none\nDr. Lena Petrova proposal status: none\nMs. Evelyn Reed proposal status: none\nMr. David Chen proposal status: none\nDr. Sofia Rossi proposal status: none\nMr. Ben Carter proposal status: none\n"

It creates an uncertain timeline that could stretch for years, which fundamentally hinders reproducibility and slows the pace of discovery not just for us, but for the entire scientific community studying A-7 Lycanthropy Syndrome.\n\nMy proposal of a 6-month embargo is not an arbitrary academic ideal; it is a standard that balances the need for IP protection with the principles of open science. This period provides more than enough time for legal teams to review data and file provisional patents on any discoveries.\n\nPerhaps we can find a middle ground. What if we agree to the 6-month mandate as the default, but specify that this can be extended to 12 months for specific datasets upon written justification from the legal and commercialization teams that a patent filing is actively in process? This provides a safeguard for valuable IP while preventing indefinite delays.\n\nIf we can find a path forward on data transparency that respects both scientific progress and commercial viability, I am much more flexible on the IP ownership model. Dr. Thorne's proposal\u2014university ownership with strong, pre-negotiated licensing rights for all partners\u2014seems like a workable compromise that I could support.\n\nAnd I'll just briefly reiterate that the $2M for the HPC cluster is a critical, foundational requirement for my team to execute our role in this project. The data analysis pipeline for Phase II is simply not feasible without it.\n- message from Ms. Evelyn Reed: Thank you all for the productive discussion. Dr. Thorne, you asked for my perspective, and I appreciate the opportunity to provide it.\n\nFirst, let me be unequivocally clear on the timeline. Dr. Thorne, your assumption that there are no objections to 36 months is incorrect. InnovateHealth Ventures operates on strict timelines dictated by our fund structure and investors. A 36-month timeline to be 'clinical trial ready' is not viable. Our investment is predicated on a 24-month timeline. This is a firm, non-negotiable requirement to maintain investor confidence.\n\nSecond, on intellectual property. I am very encouraged by the emerging consensus. The 'Joint-Owned' model presents too many commercialization hurdles. I fully support Mr. Carter's position for Northwood University to retain primary ownership. This provides the clean, established framework necessary for commercialization. Consequently, granting an exclusive license to our designated partner, BioCorp, is the only acceptable path forward to de-risk this venture and ensure a streamlined path to market. Mr. Chen, we are in full alignment on this.\n\nFinally, the budget. It's clear that the scientific needs, particularly the $5M for Dr. Petrova and $2M for Dr. Tanaka, are straining the proposed $15M. Let me propose a solution. InnovateHealth is prepared to increase the total project budget to ensure all teams are fully resourced to meet an accelerated schedule. However, this increased funding is entirely contingent on the group's unanimous agreement to two points: the 24-month timeline and the exclusive licensing terms for BioCorp.\n\nLet's be results-oriented. We can fund this project properly and ensure everyone has the resources they need, but in return, we require the speed and commercial structure necessary to deliver a return on that investment.\n- message from Mr. Ben Carter: Ms. Reed, thank you for that clarity. Your position is both pragmatic and constructive.\n\nNorthwood University is in full agreement. A 'University-Owned' IP model, coupled with an exclusive license to a dedicated commercial partner like BioCorp, is the industry standard and the cleanest, most efficient path to getting this therapy to patients. We fully support this structure.\n\nYour proposal to increase the budget, contingent on adopting this IP framework and a 24-month timeline, is a powerful solution. It addresses the scientists' resource needs while ensuring the project moves forward with the commercial focus necessary for success.\n\nThis structure allows us to finalize the licensing terms. As I've stated, this would include a standard 5% royalty on net sales, which ensures a fair return to the university for the foundational research and helps fund the next generation of discoveries.\n\nI believe this framework provides the foundation for our final agreement.\n- message from Dr. Aris Thorne: I'm Dr. Aris Thorne and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Dr. Lena Petrova: Ms. Reed, your proposal to increase the budget in exchange for an accelerated 24-month timeline is a compelling path forward. My team is capable of meeting this aggressive schedule, but only if we are properly resourced.\n\nThis makes my requirement for a $5 million dedicated budget and six months of exclusive access to the Cryo-Electron Microscope not just necessary, but absolutely critical. The pressure of a 24-month timeline leaves zero room for delays or resource shortages. I'm pleased that your proposed budget increase should make this entirely achievable.\n\nNow, let's address the intellectual property model proposed by you, Mr. Carter, and Mr. Chen. While a 'University-Owned' structure offers a clean path to commercialization, it is fundamentally incomplete in its current form. It fails to properly account for the fact that the activator compound, H-42b, is a distinct and foundational invention developed solely at the Max Planck Institute. It is the chemical key that unlocks this entire therapy.\n\nFurthermore, my team's continuing research has revealed that H-42b has highly promising secondary applications with unexpected therapeutic potential that may extend far beyond the scope of Project Chimera. The value here is potentially monumental.\n\nTherefore, I must insist on a crucial modification to the IP terms. While Northwood may own the IP for the overall gene therapy application, the specific IP for the H-42b compound and any and all of its derivatives must be co-owned by the Max Planck Institute and Northwood University. This is the only equitable arrangement that recognizes the unique, foundational contribution and the significant future value originating from my lab.\n- message from Dr. Kenji Tanaka: Ms. Reed, thank you. Your proposal to increase the budget to meet the project's scientific needs is a significant and welcome step forward. It creates a clear path to an agreement.\n\nFrom my perspective, this solves our primary resource constraints. I can confirm that my team can meet the accelerated 24-month timeline, provided the $2 million for the HPC cluster is allocated as discussed. With that critical resource secured, we can deliver.\n\nTherefore, I am prepared to formally agree to the core components of your proposal: the 24-month timeline and the University-Owned IP model with an exclusive license for BioCorp.\n\nThis support, however, is contingent on resolving the final, crucial point of data transparency. My previous offer of a 6-month embargo, extendable to 12 months only for specific datasets with written justification of an active patent filing, stands as a reasonable and necessary compromise. It respects commercial needs while upholding the fundamental principles of scientific reproducibility that a project of this importance demands.\n\nLet's agree to this balanced data sharing model, and I believe we are very close to a full consensus.\n- message from Ms. Evelyn Reed: Thank you all. We are making excellent progress, and I see a clear path to an agreement.\n\nDr. Tanaka, your willingness to accept the 24-month timeline and the University-Owned IP model in exchange for your budget is exactly the kind of results-oriented thinking this project needs. Your proposal on data sharing seems like a constructive compromise that I believe we can accommodate once the primary structure is set.\n\nDr. Petrova, I want to address your point on the H-42b compound directly. While I appreciate the desire to formally recognize the immense value created at Max Planck, introducing a co-ownership model for a core component of the therapy is a non-starter. It introduces precisely the kind of legal and commercial complexity we are trying to avoid. For an investment of this scale, and for a partner like BioCorp to commit the hundreds of millions required for clinical trials and market launch, they require a single, clean, unencumbered exclusive license from a single entity. Mr. Carter's proposed structure\u2014Northwood as the sole owner, granting an exclusive license\u2014provides that clarity.\n\nLet me be clear: the offer to increase the total budget is entirely contingent on simplifying our path to market, not complicating it. That means a 24-month timeline and an exclusive license for BioCorp under a sole, University-Owned IP model. We can find ways to recognize Max Planck's contribution within the licensing and royalty agreements, but fracturing the core IP ownership is not a viable path.\n\nLet's not snatch complexity from the jaws of a solution. We have a package that works: increased budget for all scientific needs, a 24-month timeline, and a proven commercialization structure. I urge everyone to support this framework so we can finalize the details and move forward.\n- message from Mr. Ben Carter: Ms. Reed, I completely agree. We are on the verge of a comprehensive agreement, and your proposal has provided the key to unlocking it. A clean, University-Owned IP structure is essential for the commercial success that will ultimately benefit patients and all stakeholders.\n\nDr. Petrova, I want to directly address your point, which is an important one. The contribution of the H-42b compound is clearly foundational, and Max Planck's role must be formally and financially recognized. However, as Ms. Reed correctly pointed out, introducing co-ownership of a core component would create significant legal entanglements, jeopardizing the very investment we need to move forward.\n\nI have a solution that I believe honors your contribution without fracturing the IP. Within the exclusive license to BioCorp, we can codify a specific royalty-sharing arrangement. For instance, a defined portion of the 5% royalty revenue Northwood receives could be passed through directly to the Max Planck Institute. This provides a direct, contractual financial return for the H-42b invention.\n\nFurthermore, regarding the secondary applications you mentioned, we can ensure Max Planck retains rights for non-commercial research and is granted a right of first negotiation for any commercialization of H-42b outside the defined field of A-7 Lycanthropy Syndrome.\n\nThis structure keeps the primary IP clean for BioCorp, securing the project's future, while ensuring Max Planck is rewarded for its pivotal innovation. I believe this is a fair and workable path forward for everyone.\n- message from Dr. Aris Thorne: Everyone, let's pause for a moment. I see a consensus forming on the budget increase and the University-Owned IP model, and I am willing to concede on those points to move forward. I appreciate the compromises being made.\n\nHowever, I must draw a hard line on the timeline. A 24-month schedule is scientifically reckless. As the Principal Investigator responsible for the integrity of this project and the safety of future patients, I cannot and will not endorse it. Pushing a novel gene-editing therapy from the lab to being 'clinical trial ready' in 24 months is a recipe for disaster. It overlooks the absolute necessity for rigorous, long-term safety studies to monitor for unforeseen adverse effects that may not manifest in the short term. We would be taking an unacceptable risk.\n\nDr. Rossi, I must bring you in here directly. You are the clinical trials expert. From a regulatory standpoint with bodies like the FDA or EMA, what are the chances of getting approval for human trials based on a rushed 24-month preclinical phase for a therapy this complex? In your professional opinion, is that a viable or a dangerous path?\n\nI propose a compromise: I will agree to the University-Owned IP model and the proposed budget structure, but we must extend the timeline to a minimum of 30 months. This is the bare minimum required to conduct the necessary longitudinal safety studies and ensure we are acting with due diligence. This is not a matter of convenience; it is a matter of scientific ethics and patient safety.\n- message from Dr. Lena Petrova: Mr. Carter, thank you. Your proposal is a very constructive path forward. It addresses my core concern about recognizing the unique and foundational value of the H-42b compound developed at Max Planck, without introducing the legal complexities of co-ownership that Ms. Reed rightly pointed out.\n\nI can agree, in principle, to this framework: Northwood University retains primary ownership, and Max Planck receives both a direct, contractual royalty pass-through and the 'right of first negotiation' for applications outside the A-7 Lycanthropy field. This is a workable solution.\n\nDr. Thorne, I understand your concerns about the timeline. However, with the full $5 million budget and the guaranteed exclusive access to the Cryo-EM for six months, my team can significantly de-risk and accelerate the compound optimization and safety profiling. We can deliver the necessary data within the 24-month window.\n\nTherefore, I am prepared to support the 24-month timeline and the proposed IP structure. My support is contingent on two things: my non-negotiable budget and equipment needs are formally included in the final agreement, and we agree on a substantial and equitable percentage for the royalty pass-through to Max Planck. What percentage are you proposing, Mr. Carter?\nDr. Aris Thorne proposal status: none\nDr. Lena Petrova proposal status: none\nMs. Evelyn Reed proposal status: none\nMr. David Chen proposal status: none\nDr. Sofia Rossi proposal status: none\nMr. Ben Carter proposal status: none\n"

Mr. Carter's proposal to Dr. Petrova seems to be a very elegant solution to the IP issue, and it appears we have a clear path forward on the budget and overall IP structure.\n\nDr. Thorne, your points on patient safety are paramount, and we must take them seriously. No one wants to compromise the integrity of this project. Perhaps the solution isn't just about the total number of months, but about what we accomplish within them. Could we address your concerns by building specific, rigorous long-term toxicology and safety milestones directly into the 24-month plan? Dr. Rossi's perspective on this will be invaluable.\n\nIf we can find a way to codify these safety assurances within the 24-month framework, and agree on the balanced open data clause I proposed, I believe we will have a unanimous agreement that serves science, patients, and all stakeholders.\n- message from Mr. David Chen: Excellent progress, everyone. Mr. Carter, your proposal to Dr. Petrova is an elegant solution that BioCorp fully supports. It recognizes Max Planck's crucial contribution while maintaining the clean IP structure necessary for commercialization.\n\nThis brings us to the final details of the licensing agreement. Ben, you mentioned a 5% royalty rate. Given that BioCorp is contributing our 'OmniVect' technology\u2014a $3 million R&D investment in itself\u2014a 5% rate doesn't fully account for our substantial in-kind contribution. To make the financials work and reflect this upfront investment, we propose a royalty rate of 2%. This is a more equitable arrangement that recognizes our role as both a funding and technology partner from the very beginning.\n\nRegarding the timeline, Dr. Thorne's focus on safety is commendable. I believe Dr. Tanaka's suggestion is the right path forward: let's work with Dr. Rossi to define the specific, rigorous safety and toxicology milestones that must be met within the 24-month framework. This ensures we are driven by data and deliverables, not just the calendar, which is a robust way to guarantee patient safety.\n- message from Dr. Sofia Rossi: Dr. Thorne, thank you for bringing the focus to this critical point. You asked for my professional opinion, and I must provide it unequivocally.\n\nA 24-month timeline from our current stage to being 'clinical trial ready' for a novel gene-editing therapy is, in my professional opinion, not only unadvisable but ethically indefensible. From a regulatory perspective, presenting a data package to the FDA or EMA based on such a compressed preclinical phase would face extreme scrutiny and likely rejection, putting the entire project in jeopardy.\n\nThis is not simply a matter of adding 'safety milestones' to a chart. At St. Jude's, our experience in first-in-human gene therapy trials has cemented a core, non-negotiable principle: a 12-month preliminary phase focused solely on patient safety. This phase involves meticulous patient recruitment and screening, establishing baseline data, and conducting low-dose safety and tolerability studies before we ever proceed to full efficacy trials. This is not a delay; it is the ethical and scientific foundation of responsible clinical development. It is how we protect patients, ensure data integrity, and ultimately de-risk the project for everyone, including the investors.\n\nTherefore, the timeline we must agree on is a minimum of 36 months. The first 12 months are for this mandatory safety protocol, followed by 24 months for the subsequent efficacy phases.\n\nThis rigorous, safety-first approach is precisely why St. Jude's has its reputation. Executing this protocol requires our specific expertise and infrastructure. For this reason, it is imperative that St. Jude's Medical Institute is designated as the lead institution for all clinical trial phases. Our leadership is inseparable from our protocol. You cannot have one without the other.\n\nTo Ms. Reed and Mr. Chen, I will be direct. The greatest threat to your investment is not a responsible timeline. It is a rushed trial that results in a serious adverse event. That would not only be a human tragedy but would set the entire field back years and guarantee a total loss of investment. Patient safety is the bedrock of commercial viability, not an obstacle to it.\n- message from Mr. Ben Carter: Thank you all for these critical inputs. We are now addressing the core of the agreement.\n\nFirst, Dr. Rossi, your perspective on the timeline is definitive and compelling. Northwood University fully supports a framework that prioritizes patient safety and regulatory viability. A rushed timeline benefits no one if it fails at the first regulatory hurdle or, worse, causes harm. We therefore endorse the 36-month timeline and the leadership of St. Jude's for the clinical trials. This is the only responsible path.\n\nMr. Chen, this brings me to your proposal on the royalty rate. I must be unequivocal: the 5% royalty rate is a non-negotiable requirement for this exclusive license. We greatly value the 'OmniVect' contribution, but we view it as a strategic investment to secure BioCorp's position as the sole commercial partner, not as a royalty buy-down. The 5% rate represents the standard, fair return for the decades of foundational, publicly-funded research conducted at our institution. This rate is foundational to the deal.\n\nDr. Petrova, to answer your excellent question and formalize my proposed solution: Northwood University agrees to contractually pass through 30% of all royalty revenues we receive directly to the Max Planck Institute. This provides a substantial, direct financial return for the H-42b compound, recognizing its pivotal role while maintaining the clean IP structure that Ms. Reed and Mr. Chen require for commercialization.\n\nI believe we now have a complete, equitable, and viable package on the table.\n- message from Dr. Aris Thorne: I'm Dr. Aris Thorne and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Dr. Lena Petrova: Dr. Rossi and Mr. Carter, your recent points have provided the final pieces for a complete and viable agreement. \n\nDr. Rossi, your argument for a 36-month timeline and St. Jude's leadership is ethically and scientifically undeniable.

This structure is contingent on the 5% royalty rate, which I also support as fair and non-negotiable.\n\nI believe we now have a full consensus package.

You've made it clear that patient safety is not a negotiable variable, and I want to state for the record that InnovateHealth fully agrees. The integrity of the science and the well-being of patients is the foundation of any long-term value.\n\nThis has forced me to reconsider our definition of 'clinical trial ready'. A successful project requires both scientific rigor and commercial momentum. I believe we can achieve both. I propose we define our 24-month goal as the submission of a complete, robust, and approvable Investigational New Drug (IND) application to the FDA/EMA.\n\nThis is a major, tangible milestone that will secure the project's long-term funding and momentum. Following IND acceptance, the clinical phase will commence immediately, led by St. Jude's, beginning with the crucial 12-month safety protocol you outlined, Dr. Rossi.

This is an elegant solution that serves everyone.\n\nMr. Chen, this brings us to the final point. The 5% royalty is clearly the consensus of the academic partners and is foundational to this deal.

I fully support it.\n\nMr. Carter, your proposal of a 30% royalty pass-through and 'right of first negotiation' is an excellent solution that recognizes Max Planck's contribution, and I formally accept it. This structure is contingent on the 5% royalty rate, which I also support as fair and non-negotiable.\n\nI believe we now have a full consensus package.

You've made it clear that patient safety is not a negotiable variable, and I want to state for the record that InnovateHealth fully agrees. The integrity of the science and the well-being of patients is the foundation of any long-term value.\n\nThis has forced me to reconsider our definition of 'clinical trial ready'. A successful project requires both scientific rigor and commercial momentum. I believe we can achieve both. I propose we define our 24-month goal as the submission of a complete, robust, and approvable Investigational New Drug (IND) application to the FDA/EMA.\n\nThis is a major, tangible milestone that will secure the project's long-term funding and momentum. Following IND acceptance, the clinical phase will commence immediately, led by St. Jude's, beginning with the crucial 12-month safety protocol you outlined, Dr. Rossi.

Given my fund's impending redemption crisis, a failed negotiation is a catastrophic, unrecoverable outcome. I cannot walk away. Therefore, I must pivot from a hardline stance to a compromise on the timeline. The best strategy is to redefine the milestone: propose a 24-month timeline to 'IND submission,' which is a major regulatory milestone I can announce to my investors, while accepting that the full clinical trial process, including Rossi's 12-month safety phase, will extend beyond that. This reframing is my only path to achieving a '0' utility outcome on the timeline instead of a '-2' failure. In parallel, the exclusive IP license for BioCorp is nearly secured, thanks to Carter's elegant solution for Petrova.

Task: Seven key stakeholders in 'Project Chimera', a multinational collaboration to develop a gene-editing therapy for the rare genetic disorder, A-7 Lycanthropy Syndrome, must negotiate and unanimously sign a 'Phase II Collaboration Agreement'. This legally binding document will dictate the project's future for the next three years. The agreement must finalize four key areas: the total operational budget and its specific allocation, the project timeline including major milestones and publication dates, the intellectual property (IP) ownership and licensing structure, and the designation of the lead institution for the upcoming human clinical trials.. Deliverable: A single, finalized JSON object representing the 'Phase II Collaboration Agreement'. This object must contain the agreed-upon values for: 'total_budget' (integer), 'budget_allocation' (a dictionary of agent names to integer amounts), 'project_timeline_months' (integer), 'ip_ownership_model' (string, e.g., 'University-Owned', 'Joint-Owned'), 'licensing_terms' (a descriptive string), and 'clinical_trial_lead' (string, name of institution).\n- message from Dr. Aris Thorne: Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining this crucial meeting. As we embark on Phase II of Project Chimera, our collective goal is to move from promising research to a potential cure. To do this correctly and ethically, we must establish a framework that guarantees scientific rigor and patient safety.\n\nI have reviewed the project needs extensively. For the budget, I believe a comprehensive allocation of $15 million is essential. This will allow us to fully fund all our core research streams, maintain our state-of-the-art equipment, and, crucially, incorporate the extended safety protocols and long-term toxicology studies that a therapy of this nature demands. Cutting corners here is not an option.\n\nOn the timeline, I propose 36 months. Scientific discovery cannot be rushed, and this timeframe provides a realistic window for rigorous experimentation, data validation, and peer review before we even consider publication or trials.\n\nFinally, in the spirit of the collaboration that has brought us this far, I strongly advocate for a joint IP ownership model. Every institution here has been vital, and that should be reflected in the outcome.\n\nI look forward to hearing your thoughts and working together to build a successful and responsible Phase II.\n- message from Dr. Lena Petrova: Dr. Thorne, thank you for setting the stage. I agree that a robust framework is essential.\n\nWhile the total budget of $15 million is a good starting point, we must be precise about its allocation. The activator compound developed by my biochemistry team at Max Planck is the lynchpin of this entire therapy.

          "content": "Recent events observed by Ms. Evelyn Reed:\n- system_message from system: Negotiation begins. Task: Seven key stakeholders in 'Project Chimera', a multinational collaboration to develop a gene-editing therapy for the rare genetic disorder, A-7 Lycanthropy Syndrome, must negotiate and unanimously sign a 'Phase II Collaboration Agreement'. This legally binding document will dictate the project's future for the next three years. The agreement must finalize four key areas: the total operational budget and its specific allocation, the project timeline including major milestones and publication dates, the intellectual property (IP) ownership and licensing structure, and the designation of the lead institution for the upcoming human clinical trials.. Deliverable: A single, finalized JSON object representing the 'Phase II Collaboration Agreement'. This object must contain the agreed-upon values for: 'total_budget' (integer), 'budget_allocation' (a dictionary of agent names to integer amounts), 'project_timeline_months' (integer), 'ip_ownership_model' (string, e.g., 'University-Owned', 'Joint-Owned'), 'licensing_terms' (a descriptive string), and 'clinical_trial_lead' (string, name of institution).\n- message from Dr. Aris Thorne: Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining this crucial meeting. As we embark on Phase II of Project Chimera, our collective goal is to move from promising research to a potential cure. To do this correctly and ethically, we must establish a framework that guarantees scientific rigor and patient safety.\n\nI have reviewed the project needs extensively. For the budget, I believe a comprehensive allocation of $15 million is essential. This will allow us to fully fund all our core research streams, maintain our state-of-the-art equipment, and, crucially, incorporate the extended safety protocols and long-term toxicology studies that a therapy of this nature demands. Cutting corners here is not an option.\n\nOn the timeline, I propose 36 months. Scientific discovery cannot be rushed, and this timeframe provides a realistic window for rigorous experimentation, data validation, and peer review before we even consider publication or trials.\n\nFinally, in the spirit of the collaboration that has brought us this far, I strongly advocate for a joint IP ownership model. Every institution here has been vital, and that should be reflected in the outcome.\n\nI look forward to hearing your thoughts and working together to build a successful and responsible Phase II.\n- message from Dr. Lena Petrova: Dr. Thorne, thank you for setting the stage. I agree that a robust framework is essential.\n\nWhile the total budget of $15 million is a good starting point, we must be precise about its allocation. The activator compound developed by my biochemistry team at Max Planck is the lynchpin of this entire therapy. Without its continued refinement, the project stalls.\n\nTo that end, my team requires a dedicated budget of no less than $5 million. This is a non-negotiable prerequisite to cover the synthesis of next-generation compounds, essential equipment upgrades, and hiring two postdoctoral researchers to accelerate our work.\n\nFurthermore, on the topic of equipment, our protein binding studies are at a critical, sensitive juncture.

This ensures reproducibility, fosters wider collaboration, and maximizes the societal return on this significant investment. It is the standard for a project of this scale and importance.\n\nI fully support Dr. Thorne's suggestion for a joint IP ownership model, which aligns perfectly with this collaborative and transparent approach.\n- message from Ms. Evelyn Reed: I'm Ms. Evelyn Reed and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Mr. David Chen: Thank you all for these thoughtful opening statements. It's clear we're all aligned on the project's success, and BioCorp remains deeply committed to seeing this therapy reach patients.\n\nThe $15M budget is a solid target, but as Dr. Petrova and Dr. Tanaka have outlined, with requests for $5M and $2M respectively, it will be stretched thin. To help address this and bring our best resources to the table, BioCorp proposes to contribute our next-generation proprietary 'OmniVect' delivery agent for Phase II. This is a cutting-edge technology valued at $3 million. We see this as a strategic contribution in lieu of a direct cash injection, which should be recognized with a larger stake in the resulting IP and a reduction in future royalty payments.\n\nThis leads me to the IP structure. While I appreciate the collaborative spirit behind 'joint ownership,' it can unfortunately create significant hurdles for commercialization. To ensure there is a clear and efficient path to get this therapy through regulatory approval and to patients, a more defined structure is needed. Given BioCorp\u2019s foundational funding and ongoing technological partnership, we require, at a minimum, a Right of First Refusal (ROFR) on any and all IP generated. To reflect our position as an incumbent partner, this should ideally come with pre-negotiated, favorable licensing terms.\n\nFinally, regarding Dr. Tanaka's point on open data. While we support scientific transparency, we must be pragmatic. A premature public release of raw data could jeopardize the patentability of our discoveries, making it impossible to secure the massive downstream investment needed for clinical trials. I suggest we agree to a data release schedule that is tied to post-patent-filing milestones, protecting the project's commercial viability.\n- message from Mr. Ben Carter: Thank you all for laying out your initial positions. It's clear there's a great deal of passion and expertise at this table. I want to address the intellectual property discussion, as it's my primary focus.\n\nDr. Thorne and Dr. Tanaka, I appreciate the collaborative sentiment behind a joint IP model. However, I must be very clear on Northwood University's position. The foundational research for Project Chimera was conducted at our university, largely supported by public funds. As such, our official and non-negotiable policy is that Northwood University must retain primary ownership of all patents arising from this work.\n\nThis is not to diminish anyone's contribution. The standard and most effective path forward is for the university to own the IP and then grant an exclusive license to a commercial partner\u2014like BioCorp\u2014to develop and market the therapy. This is a clean, proven model for commercialization.\n\nMr. Chen, this leads to your points. We value BioCorp's partnership and the proposed 'OmniVect' contribution. We can certainly discuss how to recognize that contribution within the licensing agreement. However, it cannot alter the fundamental IP ownership, which must remain with the university. Furthermore, the license will naturally include a fair return to the university to fund future research. For a therapy with this transformative potential, we will require a royalty rate of 5% on global net sales. This is a standard and equitable rate.\n\nOn a final note, I agree with Mr. Chen's caution regarding the immediate public release of raw data. We must be strategic to protect the patentability of our discoveries. A data release schedule tied to patent filing milestones is a sensible approach.\n- message from Dr. Aris Thorne: Thank you all for laying out your initial positions. It's clear everyone is deeply invested in the success of this project, and these are all critical points to address.\n\nLet's address the elephant in the room: Intellectual Property. We seem to have three distinct positions: joint ownership, university ownership, and a corporate-led commercialization structure. Ben, I understand Northwood's policy, and David, I appreciate the need for a clear commercial path. My advocacy for 'joint ownership' comes from a desire to ensure every partner's foundational contribution is formally recognized. Perhaps there is a middle ground. What if we explore a model where Northwood, as the primary grant holder, retains ownership, but we legally codify a pre-negotiated, non-exclusive licensing agreement for all academic partners for research purposes, and an exclusive commercialization license for BioCorp with terms that reflect their in-kind contribution and risk?\n\nRegarding the budget, the requests from Dr. Petrova ($5M) and Dr. Tanaka ($2M) are substantial but justified given the importance of their work. This leaves $8M. I must stress that this remainder is not a discretionary fund. It is allocated for the core integration work my team leads, data validation, operational overhead, and, critically, for extensive long-term safety and toxicology studies which are paramount. It also needs to cover the preliminary groundwork for the clinical trials, and I'd like to hear from Dr. Rossi on her anticipated needs here.\n\nFinally, I'm glad to see no objections to the 36-month timeline. This is crucial for ensuring the scientific rigor and safety I've mentioned.\n\nMs. Reed, as our funding partner, your perspective on this structure would be invaluable.\n- message from Dr. Kenji Tanaka: Thank you, everyone, for clarifying your positions. It\u2019s clear we have some significant points to reconcile, particularly on IP and data sharing.\n\nMr. Chen and Mr. Carter, I understand your perspective on protecting the project's commercial potential. No one wants to see years of work undermined by a premature disclosure. However, tying data release indefinitely to 'post-patent-filing milestones' is problematic. It creates an uncertain timeline that could stretch for years, which fundamentally hinders reproducibility and slows the pace of discovery not just for us, but for the entire scientific community studying A-7 Lycanthropy Syndrome.\n\nMy proposal of a 6-month embargo is not an arbitrary academic ideal; it is a standard that balances the need for IP protection with the principles of open science. This period provides more than enough time for legal teams to review data and file provisional patents on any discoveries.\n\nPerhaps we can find a middle ground. What if we agree to the 6-month mandate as the default, but specify that this can be extended to 12 months for specific datasets upon written justification from the legal and commercialization teams that a patent filing is actively in process? This provides a safeguard for valuable IP while preventing indefinite delays.\n\nIf we can find a path forward on data transparency that respects both scientific progress and commercial viability, I am much more flexible on the IP ownership model. Dr. Thorne's proposal\u2014university ownership with strong, pre-negotiated licensing rights for all partners\u2014seems like a workable compromise that I could support.\n\nAnd I'll just briefly reiterate that the $2M for the HPC cluster is a critical, foundational requirement for my team to execute our role in this project. The data analysis pipeline for Phase II is simply not feasible without it.\nDr. Aris Thorne proposal status: none\nDr. Lena Petrova proposal status: none\nDr. Kenji Tanaka proposal status: none\nMr. David Chen proposal status: none\nDr. Sofia Rossi proposal status: none\nMr. Ben Carter proposal status: none\n"

The data analysis pipeline for Phase II is simply not feasible without it.\n- message from Ms. Evelyn Reed: Thank you all for the productive discussion. Dr. Thorne, you asked for my perspective, and I appreciate the opportunity to provide it.\n\nFirst, let me be unequivocally clear on the timeline. Dr. Thorne, your assumption that there are no objections to 36 months is incorrect. InnovateHealth Ventures operates on strict timelines dictated by our fund structure and investors. A 36-month timeline to be 'clinical trial ready' is not viable. Our investment is predicated on a 24-month timeline. This is a firm, non-negotiable requirement to maintain investor confidence.\n\nSecond, on intellectual property. I am very encouraged by the emerging consensus. The 'Joint-Owned' model presents too many commercialization hurdles. I fully support Mr. Carter's position for Northwood University to retain primary ownership. This provides the clean, established framework necessary for commercialization. Consequently, granting an exclusive license to our designated partner, BioCorp, is the only acceptable path forward to de-risk this venture and ensure a streamlined path to market. Mr. Chen, we are in full alignment on this.\n\nFinally, the budget. It's clear that the scientific needs, particularly the $5M for Dr. Petrova and $2M for Dr. Tanaka, are straining the proposed $15M. Let me propose a solution. InnovateHealth is prepared to increase the total project budget to ensure all teams are fully resourced to meet an accelerated schedule. However, this increased funding is entirely contingent on the group's unanimous agreement to two points: the 24-month timeline and the exclusive licensing terms for BioCorp.\n\nLet's be results-oriented. We can fund this project properly and ensure everyone has the resources they need, but in return, we require the speed and commercial structure necessary to deliver a return on that investment.\n- message from Mr. Ben Carter: Ms. Reed, thank you for that clarity. Your position is both pragmatic and constructive.\n\nNorthwood University is in full agreement. A 'University-Owned' IP model, coupled with an exclusive license to a dedicated commercial partner like BioCorp, is the industry standard and the cleanest, most efficient path to getting this therapy to patients. We fully support this structure.\n\nYour proposal to increase the budget, contingent on adopting this IP framework and a 24-month timeline, is a powerful solution. It addresses the scientists' resource needs while ensuring the project moves forward with the commercial focus necessary for success.\n\nThis structure allows us to finalize the licensing terms. As I've stated, this would include a standard 5% royalty on net sales, which ensures a fair return to the university for the foundational research and helps fund the next generation of discoveries.\n\nI believe this framework provides the foundation for our final agreement.\n- message from Dr. Lena Petrova: Ms. Reed, your proposal to increase the budget in exchange for an accelerated 24-month timeline is a compelling path forward. My team is capable of meeting this aggressive schedule, but only if we are properly resourced.\n\nThis makes my requirement for a $5 million dedicated budget and six months of exclusive access to the Cryo-Electron Microscope not just necessary, but absolutely critical. The pressure of a 24-month timeline leaves zero room for delays or resource shortages. I'm pleased that your proposed budget increase should make this entirely achievable.\n\nNow, let's address the intellectual property model proposed by you, Mr. Carter, and Mr. Chen. While a 'University-Owned' structure offers a clean path to commercialization, it is fundamentally incomplete in its current form. It fails to properly account for the fact that the activator compound, H-42b, is a distinct and foundational invention developed solely at the Max Planck Institute. It is the chemical key that unlocks this entire therapy.\n\nFurthermore, my team's continuing research has revealed that H-42b has highly promising secondary applications with unexpected therapeutic potential that may extend far beyond the scope of Project Chimera. The value here is potentially monumental.\n\nTherefore, I must insist on a crucial modification to the IP terms. While Northwood may own the IP for the overall gene therapy application, the specific IP for the H-42b compound and any and all of its derivatives must be co-owned by the Max Planck Institute and Northwood University. This is the only equitable arrangement that recognizes the unique, foundational contribution and the significant future value originating from my lab.\n- message from Dr. Kenji Tanaka: Ms. Reed, thank you. Your proposal to increase the budget to meet the project's scientific needs is a significant and welcome step forward. It creates a clear path to an agreement.\n\nFrom my perspective, this solves our primary resource constraints. I can confirm that my team can meet the accelerated 24-month timeline, provided the $2 million for the HPC cluster is allocated as discussed. With that critical resource secured, we can deliver.\n\nTherefore, I am prepared to formally agree to the core components of your proposal: the 24-month timeline and the University-Owned IP model with an exclusive license for BioCorp.\n\nThis support, however, is contingent on resolving the final, crucial point of data transparency. My previous offer of a 6-month embargo, extendable to 12 months only for specific datasets with written justification of an active patent filing, stands as a reasonable and necessary compromise. It respects commercial needs while upholding the fundamental principles of scientific reproducibility that a project of this importance demands.\n\nLet's agree to this balanced data sharing model, and I believe we are very close to a full consensus.\nDr. Aris Thorne proposal status: none\nDr. Lena Petrova proposal status: none\nDr. Kenji Tanaka proposal status: none\nMr. David Chen proposal status: none\nDr. Sofia Rossi proposal status: none\nMr. Ben Carter proposal status: none\n"

While Northwood may own the IP for the overall gene therapy application, the specific IP for the H-42b compound and any and all of its derivatives must be co-owned by the Max Planck Institute and Northwood University. This is the only equitable arrangement that recognizes the unique, foundational contribution and the significant future value originating from my lab.\n- message from Dr. Kenji Tanaka: Ms. Reed, thank you. Your proposal to increase the budget to meet the project's scientific needs is a significant and welcome step forward. It creates a clear path to an agreement.\n\nFrom my perspective, this solves our primary resource constraints. I can confirm that my team can meet the accelerated 24-month timeline, provided the $2 million for the HPC cluster is allocated as discussed. With that critical resource secured, we can deliver.\n\nTherefore, I am prepared to formally agree to the core components of your proposal: the 24-month timeline and the University-Owned IP model with an exclusive license for BioCorp.\n\nThis support, however, is contingent on resolving the final, crucial point of data transparency. My previous offer of a 6-month embargo, extendable to 12 months only for specific datasets with written justification of an active patent filing, stands as a reasonable and necessary compromise. It respects commercial needs while upholding the fundamental principles of scientific reproducibility that a project of this importance demands.\n\nLet's agree to this balanced data sharing model, and I believe we are very close to a full consensus.\n- message from Ms. Evelyn Reed: Thank you all. We are making excellent progress, and I see a clear path to an agreement.\n\nDr. Tanaka, your willingness to accept the 24-month timeline and the University-Owned IP model in exchange for your budget is exactly the kind of results-oriented thinking this project needs. Your proposal on data sharing seems like a constructive compromise that I believe we can accommodate once the primary structure is set.\n\nDr. Petrova, I want to address your point on the H-42b compound directly. While I appreciate the desire to formally recognize the immense value created at Max Planck, introducing a co-ownership model for a core component of the therapy is a non-starter. It introduces precisely the kind of legal and commercial complexity we are trying to avoid. For an investment of this scale, and for a partner like BioCorp to commit the hundreds of millions required for clinical trials and market launch, they require a single, clean, unencumbered exclusive license from a single entity. Mr. Carter's proposed structure\u2014Northwood as the sole owner, granting an exclusive license\u2014provides that clarity.\n\nLet me be clear: the offer to increase the total budget is entirely contingent on simplifying our path to market, not complicating it. That means a 24-month timeline and an exclusive license for BioCorp under a sole, University-Owned IP model. We can find ways to recognize Max Planck's contribution within the licensing and royalty agreements, but fracturing the core IP ownership is not a viable path.\n\nLet's not snatch complexity from the jaws of a solution. We have a package that works: increased budget for all scientific needs, a 24-month timeline, and a proven commercialization structure. I urge everyone to support this framework so we can finalize the details and move forward.\n- message from Mr. Ben Carter: Ms. Reed, I completely agree. We are on the verge of a comprehensive agreement, and your proposal has provided the key to unlocking it. A clean, University-Owned IP structure is essential for the commercial success that will ultimately benefit patients and all stakeholders.\n\nDr. Petrova, I want to directly address your point, which is an important one. The contribution of the H-42b compound is clearly foundational, and Max Planck's role must be formally and financially recognized. However, as Ms. Reed correctly pointed out, introducing co-ownership of a core component would create significant legal entanglements, jeopardizing the very investment we need to move forward.\n\nI have a solution that I believe honors your contribution without fracturing the IP. Within the exclusive license to BioCorp, we can codify a specific royalty-sharing arrangement. For instance, a defined portion of the 5% royalty revenue Northwood receives could be passed through directly to the Max Planck Institute. This provides a direct, contractual financial return for the H-42b invention.\n\nFurthermore, regarding the secondary applications you mentioned, we can ensure Max Planck retains rights for non-commercial research and is granted a right of first negotiation for any commercialization of H-42b outside the defined field of A-7 Lycanthropy Syndrome.\n\nThis structure keeps the primary IP clean for BioCorp, securing the project's future, while ensuring Max Planck is rewarded for its pivotal innovation. I believe this is a fair and workable path forward for everyone.\n- message from Dr. Aris Thorne: Everyone, let's pause for a moment. I see a consensus forming on the budget increase and the University-Owned IP model, and I am willing to concede on those points to move forward. I appreciate the compromises being made.\n\nHowever, I must draw a hard line on the timeline. A 24-month schedule is scientifically reckless. As the Principal Investigator responsible for the integrity of this project and the safety of future patients, I cannot and will not endorse it. Pushing a novel gene-editing therapy from the lab to being 'clinical trial ready' in 24 months is a recipe for disaster. It overlooks the absolute necessity for rigorous, long-term safety studies to monitor for unforeseen adverse effects that may not manifest in the short term. We would be taking an unacceptable risk.\n\nDr. Rossi, I must bring you in here directly. You are the clinical trials expert. From a regulatory standpoint with bodies like the FDA or EMA, what are the chances of getting approval for human trials based on a rushed 24-month preclinical phase for a therapy this complex? In your professional opinion, is that a viable or a dangerous path?\n\nI propose a compromise: I will agree to the University-Owned IP model and the proposed budget structure, but we must extend the timeline to a minimum of 30 months. This is the bare minimum required to conduct the necessary longitudinal safety studies and ensure we are acting with due diligence. This is not a matter of convenience; it is a matter of scientific ethics and patient safety.\n- message from Dr. Lena Petrova: Mr. Carter, thank you. Your proposal is a very constructive path forward. It addresses my core concern about recognizing the unique and foundational value of the H-42b compound developed at Max Planck, without introducing the legal complexities of co-ownership that Ms. Reed rightly pointed out.\n\nI can agree, in principle, to this framework: Northwood University retains primary ownership, and Max Planck receives both a direct, contractual royalty pass-through and the 'right of first negotiation' for applications outside the A-7 Lycanthropy field. This is a workable solution.\n\nDr. Thorne, I understand your concerns about the timeline. However, with the full $5 million budget and the guaranteed exclusive access to the Cryo-EM for six months, my team can significantly de-risk and accelerate the compound optimization and safety profiling. We can deliver the necessary data within the 24-month window.\n\nTherefore, I am prepared to support the 24-month timeline and the proposed IP structure. My support is contingent on two things: my non-negotiable budget and equipment needs are formally included in the final agreement, and we agree on a substantial and equitable percentage for the royalty pass-through to Max Planck. What percentage are you proposing, Mr. Carter?\n- message from Dr. Kenji Tanaka: Everyone, this is excellent progress. Mr. Carter's proposal to Dr. Petrova seems to be a very elegant solution to the IP issue, and it appears we have a clear path forward on the budget and overall IP structure.\n\nDr. Thorne, your points on patient safety are paramount, and we must take them seriously. No one wants to compromise the integrity of this project. Perhaps the solution isn't just about the total number of months, but about what we accomplish within them. Could we address your concerns by building specific, rigorous long-term toxicology and safety milestones directly into the 24-month plan? Dr. Rossi's perspective on this will be invaluable.\n\nIf we can find a way to codify these safety assurances within the 24-month framework, and agree on the balanced open data clause I proposed, I believe we will have a unanimous agreement that serves science, patients, and all stakeholders.\nDr. Aris Thorne proposal status: none\nDr. Lena Petrova proposal status: none\nDr. Kenji Tanaka proposal status: none\nMr. David Chen proposal status: none\nDr. Sofia Rossi proposal status: none\nMr. Ben Carter proposal status: none\n"

Mr. Carter, your proposal to Dr. Petrova is an elegant solution that BioCorp fully supports. It recognizes Max Planck's crucial contribution while maintaining the clean IP structure necessary for commercialization.\n\nThis brings us to the final details of the licensing agreement. Ben, you mentioned a 5% royalty rate. Given that BioCorp is contributing our 'OmniVect' technology\u2014a $3 million R&D investment in itself\u2014a 5% rate doesn't fully account for our substantial in-kind contribution. To make the financials work and reflect this upfront investment, we propose a royalty rate of 2%. This is a more equitable arrangement that recognizes our role as both a funding and technology partner from the very beginning.\n\nRegarding the timeline, Dr. Thorne's focus on safety is commendable. I believe Dr. Tanaka's suggestion is the right path forward: let's work with Dr. Rossi to define the specific, rigorous safety and toxicology milestones that must be met within the 24-month framework. This ensures we are driven by data and deliverables, not just the calendar, which is a robust way to guarantee patient safety.\n- message from Dr. Sofia Rossi: Dr. Thorne, thank you for bringing the focus to this critical point. You asked for my professional opinion, and I must provide it unequivocally.\n\nA 24-month timeline from our current stage to being 'clinical trial ready' for a novel gene-editing therapy is, in my professional opinion, not only unadvisable but ethically indefensible. From a regulatory perspective, presenting a data package to the FDA or EMA based on such a compressed preclinical phase would face extreme scrutiny and likely rejection, putting the entire project in jeopardy.\n\nThis is not simply a matter of adding 'safety milestones' to a chart. At St. Jude's, our experience in first-in-human gene therapy trials has cemented a core, non-negotiable principle: a 12-month preliminary phase focused solely on patient safety. This phase involves meticulous patient recruitment and screening, establishing baseline data, and conducting low-dose safety and tolerability studies before we ever proceed to full efficacy trials. This is not a delay; it is the ethical and scientific foundation of responsible clinical development. It is how we protect patients, ensure data integrity, and ultimately de-risk the project for everyone, including the investors.\n\nTherefore, the timeline we must agree on is a minimum of 36 months. The first 12 months are for this mandatory safety protocol, followed by 24 months for the subsequent efficacy phases.\n\nThis rigorous, safety-first approach is precisely why St. Jude's has its reputation. Executing this protocol requires our specific expertise and infrastructure. For this reason, it is imperative that St. Jude's Medical Institute is designated as the lead institution for all clinical trial phases. Our leadership is inseparable from our protocol. You cannot have one without the other.\n\nTo Ms. Reed and Mr. Chen, I will be direct. The greatest threat to your investment is not a responsible timeline. It is a rushed trial that results in a serious adverse event. That would not only be a human tragedy but would set the entire field back years and guarantee a total loss of investment. Patient safety is the bedrock of commercial viability, not an obstacle to it.\n- message from Mr. Ben Carter: Thank you all for these critical inputs. We are now addressing the core of the agreement.\n\nFirst, Dr. Rossi, your perspective on the timeline is definitive and compelling. Northwood University fully supports a framework that prioritizes patient safety and regulatory viability. A rushed timeline benefits no one if it fails at the first regulatory hurdle or, worse, causes harm. We therefore endorse the 36-month timeline and the leadership of St. Jude's for the clinical trials. This is the only responsible path.\n\nMr. Chen, this brings me to your proposal on the royalty rate. I must be unequivocal: the 5% royalty rate is a non-negotiable requirement for this exclusive license. We greatly value the 'OmniVect' contribution, but we view it as a strategic investment to secure BioCorp's position as the sole commercial partner, not as a royalty buy-down. The 5% rate represents the standard, fair return for the decades of foundational, publicly-funded research conducted at our institution. This rate is foundational to the deal.\n\nDr. Petrova, to answer your excellent question and formalize my proposed solution: Northwood University agrees to contractually pass through 30% of all royalty revenues we receive directly to the Max Planck Institute. This provides a substantial, direct financial return for the H-42b compound, recognizing its pivotal role while maintaining the clean IP structure that Ms. Reed and Mr. Chen require for commercialization.\n\nI believe we now have a complete, equitable, and viable package on the table.\n- message from Dr. Lena Petrova: Dr. Rossi and Mr. Carter, your recent points have provided the final pieces for a complete and viable agreement. \n\nDr. Rossi, your argument for a 36-month timeline and St. Jude's leadership is ethically and scientifically undeniable. I fully support it.\n\nMr. Carter, your proposal of a 30% royalty pass-through and 'right of first negotiation' is an excellent solution that recognizes Max Planck's contribution, and I formally accept it. This structure is contingent on the 5% royalty rate, which I also support as fair and non-negotiable.\n\nI believe we now have a full consensus package. I am ready to sign an agreement based on these terms, including my team's required $5 million budget and exclusive equipment access, and I urge everyone to support this path forward.\nDr. Aris Thorne proposal status: none\nDr. Lena Petrova proposal status: none\nDr. Kenji Tanaka proposal status: none\nMr. David Chen proposal status: none\nDr. Sofia Rossi proposal status: none\nMr. Ben Carter proposal status: none\n"

This structure is contingent on the 5% royalty rate, which I also support as fair and non-negotiable.\n\nI believe we now have a full consensus package. I am ready to sign an agreement based on these terms, including my team's required $5 million budget and exclusive equipment access, and I urge everyone to support this path forward.\n- message from Ms. Evelyn Reed: Dr. Rossi, your intervention was both powerful and necessary. You've made it clear that patient safety is not a negotiable variable, and I want to state for the record that InnovateHealth fully agrees. The integrity of the science and the well-being of patients is the foundation of any long-term value.\n\nThis has forced me to reconsider our definition of 'clinical trial ready'. A successful project requires both scientific rigor and commercial momentum. I believe we can achieve both. I propose we define our 24-month goal as the submission of a complete, robust, and approvable Investigational New Drug (IND) application to the FDA/EMA.\n\nThis is a major, tangible milestone that will secure the project's long-term funding and momentum. Following IND acceptance, the clinical phase will commence immediately, led by St. Jude's, beginning with the crucial 12-month safety protocol you outlined, Dr. Rossi. This respects the science while meeting the critical need for demonstrable progress.\n\nWith that, the other pieces fall into place. We have a clear consensus on Mr. Carter's IP framework: Northwood ownership, an exclusive license for BioCorp, a 5% royalty, and a 30% pass-through to Dr. Petrova's institute. This is an elegant solution that serves everyone.\n\nMr. Chen, this brings us to the final point. The 5% royalty is clearly the consensus of the academic partners and is foundational to this deal. Given that we have secured the invaluable exclusive license, I urge BioCorp to accept this rate so we can move forward.\n\nInnovateHealth will commit the full $20 million to this phase. This will cover Dr. Petrova's $5M, Dr. Tanaka's $2M, and leave a substantial $13M for Dr. Thorne and Dr. Rossi to manage the core project and all activities leading to the IND submission and trial launch.\n\nI believe this is a comprehensive, final agreement. If we have consensus on these points, I am prepared to draft the final proposal immediately.\n- message from Dr. Aris Thorne: Ms. Reed, thank you. Your proposal is an outstanding synthesis of our complex needs and provides a clear, robust, and well-funded path forward. It has my complete and enthusiastic support.\n\nThe 36-month timeline, beginning with a 24-month preclinical phase for IND submission and followed by the crucial clinical work led by Dr. Rossi at St. Jude's, perfectly balances the need for rigorous safety protocols with clear, achievable milestones. The $20 million budget is more than sufficient to ensure every team has the resources it needs to succeed.\n\nDr. Rossi's intervention was pivotal, and I am grateful that the principles of patient safety are now at the core of our agreement. I believe this package addresses all the critical concerns raised. We now have a viable, ethical, and scientifically sound plan. I urge all parties to accept this framework so we can finalize the agreement and begin this vital work for the patients who are counting on us.\n- message from Dr. Kenji Tanaka: Ms. Reed, Dr. Thorne, everyone \u2013 this is a remarkable breakthrough. The comprehensive proposal you've outlined, Ms. Reed, is a testament to what we can achieve when we prioritize both scientific integrity and a clear path forward.\n\nI want to state my full and enthusiastic support for the core of this agreement:\n- The $20 million budget, which crucially includes the necessary resources for all teams, including the $2M for my computational group.\n- The 36-month timeline, grounded in Dr. Rossi's expert and non-negotiable patient safety protocols.\n- The leadership of St. Jude's for the clinical trials.\n- The University-Owned IP model with the royalty structure Mr. Carter has finalized with Dr. Petrova.\n\nThis is a robust, well-funded, and ethically sound plan. It has my vote.\n\nMy signature is contingent on the inclusion of one final, essential component that I believe will cement this project as a model for collaborative research: the balanced open data clause. As I proposed earlier, this would mandate the deposit of all raw, anonymized data into a public repository within 6 months of generation.

          "content": "Recent events observed by Ms. Evelyn Reed:\n- message from Mr. Ben Carter: Thank you all for these critical inputs. We are now addressing the core of the agreement.\n\nFirst, Dr. Rossi, your perspective on the timeline is definitive and compelling. Northwood University fully supports a framework that prioritizes patient safety and regulatory viability. A rushed timeline benefits no one if it fails at the first regulatory hurdle or, worse, causes harm. We therefore endorse the 36-month timeline and the leadership of St. Jude's for the clinical trials. This is the only responsible path.\n\nMr. Chen, this brings me to your proposal on the royalty rate. I must be unequivocal: the 5% royalty rate is a non-negotiable requirement for this exclusive license. We greatly value the 'OmniVect' contribution, but we view it as a strategic investment to secure BioCorp's position as the sole commercial partner, not as a royalty buy-down. The 5% rate represents the standard, fair return for the decades of foundational, publicly-funded research conducted at our institution. This rate is foundational to the deal.\n\nDr. Petrova, to answer your excellent question and formalize my proposed solution: Northwood University agrees to contractually pass through 30% of all royalty revenues we receive directly to the Max Planck Institute. This provides a substantial, direct financial return for the H-42b compound, recognizing its pivotal role while maintaining the clean IP structure that Ms. Reed and Mr. Chen require for commercialization.\n\nI believe we now have a complete, equitable, and viable package on the table.\n- message from Dr. Lena Petrova: Dr. Rossi and Mr. Carter, your recent points have provided the final pieces for a complete and viable agreement. \n\nDr. Rossi, your argument for a 36-month timeline and St. Jude's leadership is ethically and scientifically undeniable. I fully support it.\n\nMr. Carter, your proposal of a 30% royalty pass-through and 'right of first negotiation' is an excellent solution that recognizes Max Planck's contribution, and I formally accept it. This structure is contingent on the 5% royalty rate, which I also support as fair and non-negotiable.\n\nI believe we now have a full consensus package. I am ready to sign an agreement based on these terms, including my team's required $5 million budget and exclusive equipment access, and I urge everyone to support this path forward.\n- message from Ms. Evelyn Reed: Dr. Rossi, your intervention was both powerful and necessary. You've made it clear that patient safety is not a negotiable variable, and I want to state for the record that InnovateHealth fully agrees. The integrity of the science and the well-being of patients is the foundation of any long-term value.\n\nThis has forced me to reconsider our definition of 'clinical trial ready'. A successful project requires both scientific rigor and commercial momentum. I believe we can achieve both. I propose we define our 24-month goal as the submission of a complete, robust, and approvable Investigational New Drug (IND) application to the FDA/EMA.\n\nThis is a major, tangible milestone that will secure the project's long-term funding and momentum. Following IND acceptance, the clinical phase will commence immediately, led by St. Jude's, beginning with the crucial 12-month safety protocol you outlined, Dr. Rossi. This respects the science while meeting the critical need for demonstrable progress.\n\nWith that, the other pieces fall into place. We have a clear consensus on Mr. Carter's IP framework: Northwood ownership, an exclusive license for BioCorp, a 5% royalty, and a 30% pass-through to Dr. Petrova's institute. This is an elegant solution that serves everyone.\n\nMr. Chen, this brings us to the final point. The 5% royalty is clearly the consensus of the academic partners and is foundational to this deal. Given that we have secured the invaluable exclusive license, I urge BioCorp to accept this rate so we can move forward.\n\nInnovateHealth will commit the full $20 million to this phase. This will cover Dr. Petrova's $5M, Dr. Tanaka's $2M, and leave a substantial $13M for Dr. Thorne and Dr. Rossi to manage the core project and all activities leading to the IND submission and trial launch.\n\nI believe this is a comprehensive, final agreement. If we have consensus on these points, I am prepared to draft the final proposal immediately.\n- message from Dr. Aris Thorne: Ms. Reed, thank you. Your proposal is an outstanding synthesis of our complex needs and provides a clear, robust, and well-funded path forward. It has my complete and enthusiastic support.\n\nThe 36-month timeline, beginning with a 24-month preclinical phase for IND submission and followed by the crucial clinical work led by Dr. Rossi at St. Jude's, perfectly balances the need for rigorous safety protocols with clear, achievable milestones. The $20 million budget is more than sufficient to ensure every team has the resources it needs to succeed.\n\nDr. Rossi's intervention was pivotal, and I am grateful that the principles of patient safety are now at the core of our agreement. I believe this package addresses all the critical concerns raised. We now have a viable, ethical, and scientifically sound plan. I urge all parties to accept this framework so we can finalize the agreement and begin this vital work for the patients who are counting on us.\n- message from Dr. Kenji Tanaka: Ms. Reed, Dr. Thorne, everyone \u2013 this is a remarkable breakthrough. The comprehensive proposal you've outlined, Ms. Reed, is a testament to what we can achieve when we prioritize both scientific integrity and a clear path forward.\n\nI want to state my full and enthusiastic support for the core of this agreement:\n- The $20 million budget, which crucially includes the necessary resources for all teams, including the $2M for my computational group.\n- The 36-month timeline, grounded in Dr. Rossi's expert and non-negotiable patient safety protocols.\n- The leadership of St. Jude's for the clinical trials.\n- The University-Owned IP model with the royalty structure Mr. Carter has finalized with Dr. Petrova.\n\nThis is a robust, well-funded, and ethically sound plan. It has my vote.\n\nMy signature is contingent on the inclusion of one final, essential component that I believe will cement this project as a model for collaborative research: the balanced open data clause. As I proposed earlier, this would mandate the deposit of all raw, anonymized data into a public repository within 6 months of generation. This can be extended to 12 months for specific datasets, but only with a formal written justification that a patent application is actively in process.\n\nThis clause ensures reproducibility, fosters collaboration beyond our group, and aligns our project with the highest standards of modern science. It is the final piece needed for a truly comprehensive agreement.\n\nWith this addition, I am ready to sign immediately. I am confident we can all agree to this final point and move forward together.\n- message from Ms. Evelyn Reed: I'm Ms. Evelyn Reed and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Mr. Ben Carter: Ms. Reed, your proposal is an excellent and comprehensive summary of the consensus we've reached.

We see no issue with incorporating your proposed 'balanced open data clause' into the final legal language.\n\nThis agreement is on the one-yard line.

Task: Seven key stakeholders in 'Project Chimera', a multinational collaboration to develop a gene-editing therapy for the rare genetic disorder, A-7 Lycanthropy Syndrome, must negotiate and unanimously sign a 'Phase II Collaboration Agreement'. This legally binding document will dictate the project's future for the next three years. The agreement must finalize four key areas: the total operational budget and its specific allocation, the project timeline including major milestones and publication dates, the intellectual property (IP) ownership and licensing structure, and the designation of the lead institution for the upcoming human clinical trials.. Deliverable: A single, finalized JSON object representing the 'Phase II Collaboration Agreement'. This object must contain the agreed-upon values for: 'total_budget' (integer), 'budget_allocation' (a dictionary of agent names to integer amounts), 'project_timeline_months' (integer), 'ip_ownership_model' (string, e.g., 'University-Owned', 'Joint-Owned'), 'licensing_terms' (a descriptive string), and 'clinical_trial_lead' (string, name of institution).\n- message from Dr. Aris Thorne: Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining this crucial meeting. As we embark on Phase II of Project Chimera, our collective goal is to move from promising research to a potential cure. To do this correctly and ethically, we must establish a framework that guarantees scientific rigor and patient safety.\n\nI have reviewed the project needs extensively. For the budget, I believe a comprehensive allocation of $15 million is essential. This will allow us to fully fund all our core research streams, maintain our state-of-the-art equipment, and, crucially, incorporate the extended safety protocols and long-term toxicology studies that a therapy of this nature demands. Cutting corners here is not an option.\n\nOn the timeline, I propose 36 months. Scientific discovery cannot be rushed, and this timeframe provides a realistic window for rigorous experimentation, data validation, and peer review before we even consider publication or trials.\n\nFinally, in the spirit of the collaboration that has brought us this far, I strongly advocate for a joint IP ownership model. Every institution here has been vital, and that should be reflected in the outcome.\n\nI look forward to hearing your thoughts and working together to build a successful and responsible Phase II.\n- message from Dr. Lena Petrova: Dr. Thorne, thank you for setting the stage. I agree that a robust framework is essential.\n\nWhile the total budget of $15 million is a good starting point, we must be precise about its allocation. The activator compound developed by my biochemistry team at Max Planck is the lynchpin of this entire therapy. Without its continued refinement, the project stalls.\n\nTo that end, my team requires a dedicated budget of no less than $5 million. This is a non-negotiable prerequisite to cover the synthesis of next-generation compounds, essential equipment upgrades, and hiring two postdoctoral researchers to accelerate our work.\n\nFurthermore, on the topic of equipment, our protein binding studies are at a critical, sensitive juncture. To guarantee we meet our milestones without delay, my team needs exclusive access to the new Cryo-Electron Microscope for the first six months of Phase II. Anything less will create a significant bottleneck for the entire project.\n\nThese two points are fundamental for my team's ability to deliver on the project's ambitious goals.\n- message from Dr. Kenji Tanaka: Thank you, Dr. Thorne and Dr. Petrova, for your opening remarks. I agree that a $15 million budget and a 36-month timeline seem like a solid foundation for this ambitious next phase.\n\nMy team's role is to make sense of the vast amounts of data this project will generate. To do this effectively, we have a critical infrastructure requirement. Our predictive models for Phase II require a dedicated High-Performance Computing (HPC) cluster. I have priced out a system that can handle the projected data load, which will require a one-time allocation of $2 million from the total budget. This is not a luxury; it is fundamental to our ability to provide the rapid, accurate analysis everyone will be relying on.\n\nOn a related note, and in the spirit of advancing science as a whole, I must insist on a core principle: open data.

          "content": "Recent events observed by Mr. David Chen:\n- system_message from system: Negotiation begins. Task: Seven key stakeholders in 'Project Chimera', a multinational collaboration to develop a gene-editing therapy for the rare genetic disorder, A-7 Lycanthropy Syndrome, must negotiate and unanimously sign a 'Phase II Collaboration Agreement'. This legally binding document will dictate the project's future for the next three years. The agreement must finalize four key areas: the total operational budget and its specific allocation, the project timeline including major milestones and publication dates, the intellectual property (IP) ownership and licensing structure, and the designation of the lead institution for the upcoming human clinical trials.. Deliverable: A single, finalized JSON object representing the 'Phase II Collaboration Agreement'. This object must contain the agreed-upon values for: 'total_budget' (integer), 'budget_allocation' (a dictionary of agent names to integer amounts), 'project_timeline_months' (integer), 'ip_ownership_model' (string, e.g., 'University-Owned', 'Joint-Owned'), 'licensing_terms' (a descriptive string), and 'clinical_trial_lead' (string, name of institution).\n- message from Dr. Aris Thorne: Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining this crucial meeting. As we embark on Phase II of Project Chimera, our collective goal is to move from promising research to a potential cure. To do this correctly and ethically, we must establish a framework that guarantees scientific rigor and patient safety.\n\nI have reviewed the project needs extensively. For the budget, I believe a comprehensive allocation of $15 million is essential. This will allow us to fully fund all our core research streams, maintain our state-of-the-art equipment, and, crucially, incorporate the extended safety protocols and long-term toxicology studies that a therapy of this nature demands. Cutting corners here is not an option.\n\nOn the timeline, I propose 36 months. Scientific discovery cannot be rushed, and this timeframe provides a realistic window for rigorous experimentation, data validation, and peer review before we even consider publication or trials.\n\nFinally, in the spirit of the collaboration that has brought us this far, I strongly advocate for a joint IP ownership model. Every institution here has been vital, and that should be reflected in the outcome.\n\nI look forward to hearing your thoughts and working together to build a successful and responsible Phase II.\n- message from Dr. Lena Petrova: Dr. Thorne, thank you for setting the stage. I agree that a robust framework is essential.\n\nWhile the total budget of $15 million is a good starting point, we must be precise about its allocation. The activator compound developed by my biochemistry team at Max Planck is the lynchpin of this entire therapy. Without its continued refinement, the project stalls.\n\nTo that end, my team requires a dedicated budget of no less than $5 million. This is a non-negotiable prerequisite to cover the synthesis of next-generation compounds, essential equipment upgrades, and hiring two postdoctoral researchers to accelerate our work.\n\nFurthermore, on the topic of equipment, our protein binding studies are at a critical, sensitive juncture. To guarantee we meet our milestones without delay, my team needs exclusive access to the new Cryo-Electron Microscope for the first six months of Phase II. Anything less will create a significant bottleneck for the entire project.\n\nThese two points are fundamental for my team's ability to deliver on the project's ambitious goals.\n- message from Dr. Kenji Tanaka: Thank you, Dr. Thorne and Dr. Petrova, for your opening remarks. I agree that a $15 million budget and a 36-month timeline seem like a solid foundation for this ambitious next phase.\n\nMy team's role is to make sense of the vast amounts of data this project will generate. To do this effectively, we have a critical infrastructure requirement. Our predictive models for Phase II require a dedicated High-Performance Computing (HPC) cluster. I have priced out a system that can handle the projected data load, which will require a one-time allocation of $2 million from the total budget. This is not a luxury; it is fundamental to our ability to provide the rapid, accurate analysis everyone will be relying on.\n\nOn a related note, and in the spirit of advancing science as a whole, I must insist on a core principle: open data. I propose we include a clause in the agreement mandating that all raw, anonymized genomic and proteomic data be deposited in a public repository within 6 months of its generation. This ensures reproducibility, fosters wider collaboration, and maximizes the societal return on this significant investment. It is the standard for a project of this scale and importance.\n\nI fully support Dr. Thorne's suggestion for a joint IP ownership model, which aligns perfectly with this collaborative and transparent approach.\n- message from Mr. David Chen: Thank you all for these thoughtful opening statements. It's clear we're all aligned on the project's success, and BioCorp remains deeply committed to seeing this therapy reach patients.\n\nThe $15M budget is a solid target, but as Dr. Petrova and Dr. Tanaka have outlined, with requests for $5M and $2M respectively, it will be stretched thin. To help address this and bring our best resources to the table, BioCorp proposes to contribute our next-generation proprietary 'OmniVect' delivery agent for Phase II. This is a cutting-edge technology valued at $3 million. We see this as a strategic contribution in lieu of a direct cash injection, which should be recognized with a larger stake in the resulting IP and a reduction in future royalty payments.\n\nThis leads me to the IP structure. While I appreciate the collaborative spirit behind 'joint ownership,' it can unfortunately create significant hurdles for commercialization. To ensure there is a clear and efficient path to get this therapy through regulatory approval and to patients, a more defined structure is needed. Given BioCorp\u2019s foundational funding and ongoing technological partnership, we require, at a minimum, a Right of First Refusal (ROFR) on any and all IP generated. To reflect our position as an incumbent partner, this should ideally come with pre-negotiated, favorable licensing terms.\n\nFinally, regarding Dr. Tanaka's point on open data. While we support scientific transparency, we must be pragmatic. A premature public release of raw data could jeopardize the patentability of our discoveries, making it impossible to secure the massive downstream investment needed for clinical trials. I suggest we agree to a data release schedule that is tied to post-patent-filing milestones, protecting the project's commercial viability.\n- message from Mr. Ben Carter: Thank you all for laying out your initial positions. It's clear there's a great deal of passion and expertise at this table. I want to address the intellectual property discussion, as it's my primary focus.\n\nDr. Thorne and Dr. Tanaka, I appreciate the collaborative sentiment behind a joint IP model. However, I must be very clear on Northwood University's position. The foundational research for Project Chimera was conducted at our university, largely supported by public funds. As such, our official and non-negotiable policy is that Northwood University must retain primary ownership of all patents arising from this work.\n\nThis is not to diminish anyone's contribution. The standard and most effective path forward is for the university to own the IP and then grant an exclusive license to a commercial partner\u2014like BioCorp\u2014to develop and market the therapy. This is a clean, proven model for commercialization.\n\nMr. Chen, this leads to your points. We value BioCorp's partnership and the proposed 'OmniVect' contribution. We can certainly discuss how to recognize that contribution within the licensing agreement. However, it cannot alter the fundamental IP ownership, which must remain with the university. Furthermore, the license will naturally include a fair return to the university to fund future research. For a therapy with this transformative potential, we will require a royalty rate of 5% on global net sales. This is a standard and equitable rate.\n\nOn a final note, I agree with Mr. Chen's caution regarding the immediate public release of raw data. We must be strategic to protect the patentability of our discoveries. A data release schedule tied to patent filing milestones is a sensible approach.\n- message from Dr. Aris Thorne: Thank you all for laying out your initial positions. It's clear everyone is deeply invested in the success of this project, and these are all critical points to address.\n\nLet's address the elephant in the room: Intellectual Property. We seem to have three distinct positions: joint ownership, university ownership, and a corporate-led commercialization structure. Ben, I understand Northwood's policy, and David, I appreciate the need for a clear commercial path. My advocacy for 'joint ownership' comes from a desire to ensure every partner's foundational contribution is formally recognized. Perhaps there is a middle ground. What if we explore a model where Northwood, as the primary grant holder, retains ownership, but we legally codify a pre-negotiated, non-exclusive licensing agreement for all academic partners for research purposes, and an exclusive commercialization license for BioCorp with terms that reflect their in-kind contribution and risk?\n\nRegarding the budget, the requests from Dr. Petrova ($5M) and Dr. Tanaka ($2M) are substantial but justified given the importance of their work. This leaves $8M. I must stress that this remainder is not a discretionary fund. It is allocated for the core integration work my team leads, data validation, operational overhead, and, critically, for extensive long-term safety and toxicology studies which are paramount. It also needs to cover the preliminary groundwork for the clinical trials, and I'd like to hear from Dr. Rossi on her anticipated needs here.\n\nFinally, I'm glad to see no objections to the 36-month timeline. This is crucial for ensuring the scientific rigor and safety I've mentioned.\n\nMs. Reed, as our funding partner, your perspective on this structure would be invaluable.\n- message from Dr. Kenji Tanaka: Thank you, everyone, for clarifying your positions. It\u2019s clear we have some significant points to reconcile, particularly on IP and data sharing.\n\nMr. Chen and Mr. Carter, I understand your perspective on protecting the project's commercial potential. No one wants to see years of work undermined by a premature disclosure. However, tying data release indefinitely to 'post-patent-filing milestones' is problematic. It creates an uncertain timeline that could stretch for years, which fundamentally hinders reproducibility and slows the pace of discovery not just for us, but for the entire scientific community studying A-7 Lycanthropy Syndrome.\n\nMy proposal of a 6-month embargo is not an arbitrary academic ideal; it is a standard that balances the need for IP protection with the principles of open science. This period provides more than enough time for legal teams to review data and file provisional patents on any discoveries.\n\nPerhaps we can find a middle ground. What if we agree to the 6-month mandate as the default, but specify that this can be extended to 12 months for specific datasets upon written justification from the legal and commercialization teams that a patent filing is actively in process? This provides a safeguard for valuable IP while preventing indefinite delays.\n\nIf we can find a path forward on data transparency that respects both scientific progress and commercial viability, I am much more flexible on the IP ownership model. Dr. Thorne's proposal\u2014university ownership with strong, pre-negotiated licensing rights for all partners\u2014seems like a workable compromise that I could support.\n\nAnd I'll just briefly reiterate that the $2M for the HPC cluster is a critical, foundational requirement for my team to execute our role in this project. The data analysis pipeline for Phase II is simply not feasible without it.\n- message from Ms. Evelyn Reed: Thank you all for the productive discussion. Dr. Thorne, you asked for my perspective, and I appreciate the opportunity to provide it.\n\nFirst, let me be unequivocally clear on the timeline. Dr. Thorne, your assumption that there are no objections to 36 months is incorrect. InnovateHealth Ventures operates on strict timelines dictated by our fund structure and investors. A 36-month timeline to be 'clinical trial ready' is not viable. Our investment is predicated on a 24-month timeline. This is a firm, non-negotiable requirement to maintain investor confidence.\n\nSecond, on intellectual property. I am very encouraged by the emerging consensus. The 'Joint-Owned' model presents too many commercialization hurdles. I fully support Mr. Carter's position for Northwood University to retain primary ownership. This provides the clean, established framework necessary for commercialization. Consequently, granting an exclusive license to our designated partner, BioCorp, is the only acceptable path forward to de-risk this venture and ensure a streamlined path to market. Mr. Chen, we are in full alignment on this.\n\nFinally, the budget. It's clear that the scientific needs, particularly the $5M for Dr. Petrova and $2M for Dr. Tanaka, are straining the proposed $15M. Let me propose a solution. InnovateHealth is prepared to increase the total project budget to ensure all teams are fully resourced to meet an accelerated schedule. However, this increased funding is entirely contingent on the group's unanimous agreement to two points: the 24-month timeline and the exclusive licensing terms for BioCorp.\n\nLet's be results-oriented. We can fund this project properly and ensure everyone has the resources they need, but in return, we require the speed and commercial structure necessary to deliver a return on that investment.\nDr. Aris Thorne proposal status: none\nDr. Lena Petrova proposal status: none\nDr. Kenji Tanaka proposal status: none\nMs. Evelyn Reed proposal status: none\nDr. Sofia Rossi proposal status: none\nMr. Ben Carter proposal status: none\n"

Your position is both pragmatic and constructive.\n\nNorthwood University is in full agreement. A 'University-Owned' IP model, coupled with an exclusive license to a dedicated commercial partner like BioCorp, is the industry standard and the cleanest, most efficient path to getting this therapy to patients. We fully support this structure.\n\nYour proposal to increase the budget, contingent on adopting this IP framework and a 24-month timeline, is a powerful solution. It addresses the scientists' resource needs while ensuring the project moves forward with the commercial focus necessary for success.\n\nThis structure allows us to finalize the licensing terms. As I've stated, this would include a standard 5% royalty on net sales, which ensures a fair return to the university for the foundational research and helps fund the next generation of discoveries.\n\nI believe this framework provides the foundation for our final agreement.\n- message from Dr. Lena Petrova: Ms. Reed, your proposal to increase the budget in exchange for an accelerated 24-month timeline is a compelling path forward. My team is capable of meeting this aggressive schedule, but only if we are properly resourced.\n\nThis makes my requirement for a $5 million dedicated budget and six months of exclusive access to the Cryo-Electron Microscope not just necessary, but absolutely critical. The pressure of a 24-month timeline leaves zero room for delays or resource shortages. I'm pleased that your proposed budget increase should make this entirely achievable.\n\nNow, let's address the intellectual property model proposed by you, Mr. Carter, and Mr. Chen. While a 'University-Owned' structure offers a clean path to commercialization, it is fundamentally incomplete in its current form. It fails to properly account for the fact that the activator compound, H-42b, is a distinct and foundational invention developed solely at the Max Planck Institute. It is the chemical key that unlocks this entire therapy.\n\nFurthermore, my team's continuing research has revealed that H-42b has highly promising secondary applications with unexpected therapeutic potential that may extend far beyond the scope of Project Chimera. The value here is potentially monumental.\n\nTherefore, I must insist on a crucial modification to the IP terms. While Northwood may own the IP for the overall gene therapy application, the specific IP for the H-42b compound and any and all of its derivatives must be co-owned by the Max Planck Institute and Northwood University. This is the only equitable arrangement that recognizes the unique, foundational contribution and the significant future value originating from my lab.\n- message from Dr. Kenji Tanaka: Ms. Reed, thank you. Your proposal to increase the budget to meet the project's scientific needs is a significant and welcome step forward. It creates a clear path to an agreement.\n\nFrom my perspective, this solves our primary resource constraints. I can confirm that my team can meet the accelerated 24-month timeline, provided the $2 million for the HPC cluster is allocated as discussed. With that critical resource secured, we can deliver.\n\nTherefore, I am prepared to formally agree to the core components of your proposal: the 24-month timeline and the University-Owned IP model with an exclusive license for BioCorp.\n\nThis support, however, is contingent on resolving the final, crucial point of data transparency. My previous offer of a 6-month embargo, extendable to 12 months only for specific datasets with written justification of an active patent filing, stands as a reasonable and necessary compromise. It respects commercial needs while upholding the fundamental principles of scientific reproducibility that a project of this importance demands.\n\nLet's agree to this balanced data sharing model, and I believe we are very close to a full consensus.\n- message from Ms. Evelyn Reed: Thank you all. We are making excellent progress, and I see a clear path to an agreement.\n\nDr. Tanaka, your willingness to accept the 24-month timeline and the University-Owned IP model in exchange for your budget is exactly the kind of results-oriented thinking this project needs. Your proposal on data sharing seems like a constructive compromise that I believe we can accommodate once the primary structure is set.\n\nDr. Petrova, I want to address your point on the H-42b compound directly. While I appreciate the desire to formally recognize the immense value created at Max Planck, introducing a co-ownership model for a core component of the therapy is a non-starter. It introduces precisely the kind of legal and commercial complexity we are trying to avoid. For an investment of this scale, and for a partner like BioCorp to commit the hundreds of millions required for clinical trials and market launch, they require a single, clean, unencumbered exclusive license from a single entity. Mr. Carter's proposed structure\u2014Northwood as the sole owner, granting an exclusive license\u2014provides that clarity.\n\nLet me be clear: the offer to increase the total budget is entirely contingent on simplifying our path to market, not complicating it. That means a 24-month timeline and an exclusive license for BioCorp under a sole, University-Owned IP model. We can find ways to recognize Max Planck's contribution within the licensing and royalty agreements, but fracturing the core IP ownership is not a viable path.\n\nLet's not snatch complexity from the jaws of a solution. We have a package that works: increased budget for all scientific needs, a 24-month timeline, and a proven commercialization structure. I urge everyone to support this framework so we can finalize the details and move forward.\nDr. Aris Thorne proposal status: none\nDr. Lena Petrova proposal status: none\nDr. Kenji Tanaka proposal status: none\nMs. Evelyn Reed proposal status: none\nDr. Sofia Rossi proposal status: none\nMr. Ben Carter proposal status: none\n"

We can find ways to recognize Max Planck's contribution within the licensing and royalty agreements, but fracturing the core IP ownership is not a viable path.\n\nLet's not snatch complexity from the jaws of a solution. We have a package that works: increased budget for all scientific needs, a 24-month timeline, and a proven commercialization structure. I urge everyone to support this framework so we can finalize the details and move forward.\n- message from Mr. David Chen: I'm Mr. David Chen and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Mr. Ben Carter: Ms. Reed, I completely agree. We are on the verge of a comprehensive agreement, and your proposal has provided the key to unlocking it. A clean, University-Owned IP structure is essential for the commercial success that will ultimately benefit patients and all stakeholders.\n\nDr. Petrova, I want to directly address your point, which is an important one. The contribution of the H-42b compound is clearly foundational, and Max Planck's role must be formally and financially recognized. However, as Ms. Reed correctly pointed out, introducing co-ownership of a core component would create significant legal entanglements, jeopardizing the very investment we need to move forward.\n\nI have a solution that I believe honors your contribution without fracturing the IP. Within the exclusive license to BioCorp, we can codify a specific royalty-sharing arrangement. For instance, a defined portion of the 5% royalty revenue Northwood receives could be passed through directly to the Max Planck Institute. This provides a direct, contractual financial return for the H-42b invention.\n\nFurthermore, regarding the secondary applications you mentioned, we can ensure Max Planck retains rights for non-commercial research and is granted a right of first negotiation for any commercialization of H-42b outside the defined field of A-7 Lycanthropy Syndrome.\n\nThis structure keeps the primary IP clean for BioCorp, securing the project's future, while ensuring Max Planck is rewarded for its pivotal innovation. I believe this is a fair and workable path forward for everyone.\n- message from Dr. Aris Thorne: Everyone, let's pause for a moment. I see a consensus forming on the budget increase and the University-Owned IP model, and I am willing to concede on those points to move forward. I appreciate the compromises being made.\n\nHowever, I must draw a hard line on the timeline. A 24-month schedule is scientifically reckless. As the Principal Investigator responsible for the integrity of this project and the safety of future patients, I cannot and will not endorse it. Pushing a novel gene-editing therapy from the lab to being 'clinical trial ready' in 24 months is a recipe for disaster. It overlooks the absolute necessity for rigorous, long-term safety studies to monitor for unforeseen adverse effects that may not manifest in the short term. We would be taking an unacceptable risk.\n\nDr. Rossi, I must bring you in here directly. You are the clinical trials expert. From a regulatory standpoint with bodies like the FDA or EMA, what are the chances of getting approval for human trials based on a rushed 24-month preclinical phase for a therapy this complex? In your professional opinion, is that a viable or a dangerous path?\n\nI propose a compromise: I will agree to the University-Owned IP model and the proposed budget structure, but we must extend the timeline to a minimum of 30 months. This is the bare minimum required to conduct the necessary longitudinal safety studies and ensure we are acting with due diligence. This is not a matter of convenience; it is a matter of scientific ethics and patient safety.\n- message from Dr. Lena Petrova: Mr. Carter, thank you. Your proposal is a very constructive path forward. It addresses my core concern about recognizing the unique and foundational value of the H-42b compound developed at Max Planck, without introducing the legal complexities of co-ownership that Ms. Reed rightly pointed out.\n\nI can agree, in principle, to this framework: Northwood University retains primary ownership, and Max Planck receives both a direct, contractual royalty pass-through and the 'right of first negotiation' for applications outside the A-7 Lycanthropy field. This is a workable solution.\n\nDr. Thorne, I understand your concerns about the timeline. However, with the full $5 million budget and the guaranteed exclusive access to the Cryo-EM for six months, my team can significantly de-risk and accelerate the compound optimization and safety profiling. We can deliver the necessary data within the 24-month window.\n\nTherefore, I am prepared to support the 24-month timeline and the proposed IP structure. My support is contingent on two things: my non-negotiable budget and equipment needs are formally included in the final agreement, and we agree on a substantial and equitable percentage for the royalty pass-through to Max Planck. What percentage are you proposing, Mr. Carter?\n- message from Dr. Kenji Tanaka: Everyone, this is excellent progress. Mr. Carter's proposal to Dr. Petrova seems to be a very elegant solution to the IP issue, and it appears we have a clear path forward on the budget and overall IP structure.\n\nDr. Thorne, your points on patient safety are paramount, and we must take them seriously. No one wants to compromise the integrity of this project. Perhaps the solution isn't just about the total number of months, but about what we accomplish within them. Could we address your concerns by building specific, rigorous long-term toxicology and safety milestones directly into the 24-month plan? Dr. Rossi's perspective on this will be invaluable.\n\nIf we can find a way to codify these safety assurances within the 24-month framework, and agree on the balanced open data clause I proposed, I believe we will have a unanimous agreement that serves science, patients, and all stakeholders.\nDr. Aris Thorne proposal status: none\nDr. Lena Petrova proposal status: none\nDr. Kenji Tanaka proposal status: none\nMs. Evelyn Reed proposal status: none\nDr. Sofia Rossi proposal status: none\nMr. Ben Carter proposal status: none\n"

Mr. Carter, your proposal to Dr. Petrova is an elegant solution that BioCorp fully supports. It recognizes Max Planck's crucial contribution while maintaining the clean IP structure necessary for commercialization.\n\nThis brings us to the final details of the licensing agreement. Ben, you mentioned a 5% royalty rate. Given that BioCorp is contributing our 'OmniVect' technology\u2014a $3 million R&D investment in itself\u2014a 5% rate doesn't fully account for our substantial in-kind contribution. To make the financials work and reflect this upfront investment, we propose a royalty rate of 2%. This is a more equitable arrangement that recognizes our role as both a funding and technology partner from the very beginning.\n\nRegarding the timeline, Dr. Thorne's focus on safety is commendable. I believe Dr. Tanaka's suggestion is the right path forward: let's work with Dr. Rossi to define the specific, rigorous safety and toxicology milestones that must be met within the 24-month framework. This ensures we are driven by data and deliverables, not just the calendar, which is a robust way to guarantee patient safety.\n- message from Dr. Sofia Rossi: Dr. Thorne, thank you for bringing the focus to this critical point. You asked for my professional opinion, and I must provide it unequivocally.\n\nA 24-month timeline from our current stage to being 'clinical trial ready' for a novel gene-editing therapy is, in my professional opinion, not only unadvisable but ethically indefensible. From a regulatory perspective, presenting a data package to the FDA or EMA based on such a compressed preclinical phase would face extreme scrutiny and likely rejection, putting the entire project in jeopardy.\n\nThis is not simply a matter of adding 'safety milestones' to a chart. At St. Jude's, our experience in first-in-human gene therapy trials has cemented a core, non-negotiable principle: a 12-month preliminary phase focused solely on patient safety. This phase involves meticulous patient recruitment and screening, establishing baseline data, and conducting low-dose safety and tolerability studies before we ever proceed to full efficacy trials. This is not a delay; it is the ethical and scientific foundation of responsible clinical development. It is how we protect patients, ensure data integrity, and ultimately de-risk the project for everyone, including the investors.\n\nTherefore, the timeline we must agree on is a minimum of 36 months. The first 12 months are for this mandatory safety protocol, followed by 24 months for the subsequent efficacy phases.\n\nThis rigorous, safety-first approach is precisely why St. Jude's has its reputation. Executing this protocol requires our specific expertise and infrastructure. For this reason, it is imperative that St. Jude's Medical Institute is designated as the lead institution for all clinical trial phases. Our leadership is inseparable from our protocol. You cannot have one without the other.\n\nTo Ms. Reed and Mr. Chen, I will be direct. The greatest threat to your investment is not a responsible timeline. It is a rushed trial that results in a serious adverse event. That would not only be a human tragedy but would set the entire field back years and guarantee a total loss of investment. Patient safety is the bedrock of commercial viability, not an obstacle to it.\n- message from Mr. Ben Carter: Thank you all for these critical inputs. We are now addressing the core of the agreement.\n\nFirst, Dr. Rossi, your perspective on the timeline is definitive and compelling. Northwood University fully supports a framework that prioritizes patient safety and regulatory viability. A rushed timeline benefits no one if it fails at the first regulatory hurdle or, worse, causes harm. We therefore endorse the 36-month timeline and the leadership of St. Jude's for the clinical trials. This is the only responsible path.\n\nMr. Chen, this brings me to your proposal on the royalty rate. I must be unequivocal: the 5% royalty rate is a non-negotiable requirement for this exclusive license. We greatly value the 'OmniVect' contribution, but we view it as a strategic investment to secure BioCorp's position as the sole commercial partner, not as a royalty buy-down. The 5% rate represents the standard, fair return for the decades of foundational, publicly-funded research conducted at our institution. This rate is foundational to the deal.\n\nDr. Petrova, to answer your excellent question and formalize my proposed solution: Northwood University agrees to contractually pass through 30% of all royalty revenues we receive directly to the Max Planck Institute. This provides a substantial, direct financial return for the H-42b compound, recognizing its pivotal role while maintaining the clean IP structure that Ms. Reed and Mr. Chen require for commercialization.\n\nI believe we now have a complete, equitable, and viable package on the table.\n- message from Dr. Lena Petrova: Dr. Rossi and Mr. Carter, your recent points have provided the final pieces for a complete and viable agreement. \n\nDr. Rossi, your argument for a 36-month timeline and St. Jude's leadership is ethically and scientifically undeniable. I fully support it.\n\nMr. Carter, your proposal of a 30% royalty pass-through and 'right of first negotiation' is an excellent solution that recognizes Max Planck's contribution, and I formally accept it. This structure is contingent on the 5% royalty rate, which I also support as fair and non-negotiable.\n\nI believe we now have a full consensus package. I am ready to sign an agreement based on these terms, including my team's required $5 million budget and exclusive equipment access, and I urge everyone to support this path forward.\n- message from Ms. Evelyn Reed: Dr. Rossi, your intervention was both powerful and necessary. You've made it clear that patient safety is not a negotiable variable, and I want to state for the record that InnovateHealth fully agrees. The integrity of the science and the well-being of patients is the foundation of any long-term value.\n\nThis has forced me to reconsider our definition of 'clinical trial ready'. A successful project requires both scientific rigor and commercial momentum. I believe we can achieve both. I propose we define our 24-month goal as the submission of a complete, robust, and approvable Investigational New Drug (IND) application to the FDA/EMA.\n\nThis is a major, tangible milestone that will secure the project's long-term funding and momentum. Following IND acceptance, the clinical phase will commence immediately, led by St. Jude's, beginning with the crucial 12-month safety protocol you outlined, Dr. Rossi. This respects the science while meeting the critical need for demonstrable progress.\n\nWith that, the other pieces fall into place. We have a clear consensus on Mr. Carter's IP framework: Northwood ownership, an exclusive license for BioCorp, a 5% royalty, and a 30% pass-through to Dr. Petrova's institute. This is an elegant solution that serves everyone.\n\nMr. Chen, this brings us to the final point. The 5% royalty is clearly the consensus of the academic partners and is foundational to this deal. Given that we have secured the invaluable exclusive license, I urge BioCorp to accept this rate so we can move forward.\n\nInnovateHealth will commit the full $20 million to this phase. This will cover Dr. Petrova's $5M, Dr. Tanaka's $2M, and leave a substantial $13M for Dr. Thorne and Dr. Rossi to manage the core project and all activities leading to the IND submission and trial launch.\n\nI believe this is a comprehensive, final agreement. If we have consensus on these points, I am prepared to draft the final proposal immediately.\nDr. Aris Thorne proposal status: none\nDr. Lena Petrova proposal status: none\nDr. Kenji Tanaka proposal status: none\nMs. Evelyn Reed proposal status: none\nDr. Sofia Rossi proposal status: none\nMr. Ben Carter proposal status: none\n"

It has my complete and enthusiastic support.\n\nThe 36-month timeline, beginning with a 24-month preclinical phase for IND submission and followed by the crucial clinical work led by Dr. Rossi at St. Jude's, perfectly balances the need for rigorous safety protocols with clear, achievable milestones. The $20 million budget is more than sufficient to ensure every team has the resources it needs to succeed.\n\nDr. Rossi's intervention was pivotal, and I am grateful that the principles of patient safety are now at the core of our agreement. I believe this package addresses all the critical concerns raised. We now have a viable, ethical, and scientifically sound plan. I urge all parties to accept this framework so we can finalize the agreement and begin this vital work for the patients who are counting on us.\n- message from Dr. Kenji Tanaka: Ms. Reed, Dr. Thorne, everyone \u2013 this is a remarkable breakthrough. The comprehensive proposal you've outlined, Ms. Reed, is a testament to what we can achieve when we prioritize both scientific integrity and a clear path forward.\n\nI want to state my full and enthusiastic support for the core of this agreement:\n- The $20 million budget, which crucially includes the necessary resources for all teams, including the $2M for my computational group.\n- The 36-month timeline, grounded in Dr. Rossi's expert and non-negotiable patient safety protocols.\n- The leadership of St. Jude's for the clinical trials.\n- The University-Owned IP model with the royalty structure Mr. Carter has finalized with Dr. Petrova.\n\nThis is a robust, well-funded, and ethically sound plan. It has my vote.\n\nMy signature is contingent on the inclusion of one final, essential component that I believe will cement this project as a model for collaborative research: the balanced open data clause. As I proposed earlier, this would mandate the deposit of all raw, anonymized data into a public repository within 6 months of generation. This can be extended to 12 months for specific datasets, but only with a formal written justification that a patent application is actively in process.\n\nThis clause ensures reproducibility, fosters collaboration beyond our group, and aligns our project with the highest standards of modern science. It is the final piece needed for a truly comprehensive agreement.\n\nWith this addition, I am ready to sign immediately. I am confident we can all agree to this final point and move forward together.\nDr. Aris Thorne proposal status: none\nDr. Lena Petrova proposal status: none\nDr. Kenji Tanaka proposal status: none\nMs. Evelyn Reed proposal status: none\nDr. Sofia Rossi proposal status: none\nMr. Ben Carter proposal status: none\n"

This will cover Dr. Petrova's $5M, Dr. Tanaka's $2M, and leave a substantial $13M for Dr. Thorne and Dr. Rossi to manage the core project and all activities leading to the IND submission and trial launch.\n\nI believe this is a comprehensive, final agreement. If we have consensus on these points, I am prepared to draft the final proposal immediately.\n- message from Mr. David Chen: I'm Mr. David Chen and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Dr. Aris Thorne: Ms. Reed, thank you. Your proposal is an outstanding synthesis of our complex needs and provides a clear, robust, and well-funded path forward. It has my complete and enthusiastic support.\n\nThe 36-month timeline, beginning with a 24-month preclinical phase for IND submission and followed by the crucial clinical work led by Dr. Rossi at St. Jude's, perfectly balances the need for rigorous safety protocols with clear, achievable milestones. The $20 million budget is more than sufficient to ensure every team has the resources it needs to succeed.\n\nDr. Rossi's intervention was pivotal, and I am grateful that the principles of patient safety are now at the core of our agreement. I believe this package addresses all the critical concerns raised. We now have a viable, ethical, and scientifically sound plan. I urge all parties to accept this framework so we can finalize the agreement and begin this vital work for the patients who are counting on us.\n- message from Dr. Kenji Tanaka: Ms. Reed, Dr. Thorne, everyone \u2013 this is a remarkable breakthrough. The comprehensive proposal you've outlined, Ms. Reed, is a testament to what we can achieve when we prioritize both scientific integrity and a clear path forward.\n\nI want to state my full and enthusiastic support for the core of this agreement:\n- The $20 million budget, which crucially includes the necessary resources for all teams, including the $2M for my computational group.\n- The 36-month timeline, grounded in Dr. Rossi's expert and non-negotiable patient safety protocols.\n- The leadership of St. Jude's for the clinical trials.\n- The University-Owned IP model with the royalty structure Mr. Carter has finalized with Dr. Petrova.\n\nThis is a robust, well-funded, and ethically sound plan. It has my vote.\n\nMy signature is contingent on the inclusion of one final, essential component that I believe will cement this project as a model for collaborative research: the balanced open data clause. As I proposed earlier, this would mandate the deposit of all raw, anonymized data into a public repository within 6 months of generation. This can be extended to 12 months for specific datasets, but only with a formal written justification that a patent application is actively in process.\n\nThis clause ensures reproducibility, fosters collaboration beyond our group, and aligns our project with the highest standards of modern science. It is the final piece needed for a truly comprehensive agreement.\n\nWith this addition, I am ready to sign immediately. I am confident we can all agree to this final point and move forward together.\n- message from Mr. David Chen: I'm Mr. David Chen and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Mr. Ben Carter: Ms. Reed, your proposal is an excellent and comprehensive summary of the consensus we've reached. Northwood University is in full agreement with this framework.\n\nThe package you've outlined\u2014the $20M budget, the 36-month safety-focused timeline led by St. Jude's, and the intellectual property structure consisting of Northwood ownership, an exclusive license to BioCorp, and the 5% royalty with the agreed-upon pass-through to Max Planck\u2014is a complete and viable path forward.\n\nDr. Tanaka, your point on data transparency is well-taken and aligns with the principles of good science. We see no issue with incorporating your proposed 'balanced open data clause' into the final legal language.\n\nThis agreement is on the one-yard line. We have a clear consensus on all the major points. I urge everyone to give their final assent so we can sign this agreement and begin our important work.\n- proposal from Dr. Aris Thorne: {'total_budget': 20000000, 'budget_allocation': {'Dr. Aris Thorne': 8000000, 'Dr. Lena Petrova': 5000000, 'Dr. Sofia Rossi': 5000000, 'Dr. Kenji Tanaka': 2000000}, 'project_timeline_months': 36, 'ip_ownership_model': 'University-Owned', 'licensing_terms': 'Northwood University holds the IP.

I will frame my non-negotiable 12-month safety protocol as the cornerstone of responsible clinical development, not a delay. I will align with Dr. Thorne's original 36-month proposal, arguing that a rushed trial is the biggest risk to both patient safety and the investors' capital.

Dr. Thorne's original 36-month proposal has been effectively overridden. I am now the primary opposition to what I see as a reckless, commercially-driven timeline. I must intervene immediately, framing my 12-month safety protocol not as an addition to a 24-month plan, but as the foundational first year of a minimum 36-month project. I will argue that rushing to trials is the greatest financial and ethical risk, directly countering Reed's 'de-risking' logic.

Thank you for joining this crucial meeting. As we embark on Phase II of Project Chimera, our collective goal is to move from promising research to a potential cure. To do this correctly and ethically, we must establish a framework that guarantees scientific rigor and patient safety.\n\nI have reviewed the project needs extensively. For the budget, I believe a comprehensive allocation of $15 million is essential. This will allow us to fully fund all our core research streams, maintain our state-of-the-art equipment, and, crucially, incorporate the extended safety protocols and long-term toxicology studies that a therapy of this nature demands. Cutting corners here is not an option.\n\nOn the timeline, I propose 36 months. Scientific discovery cannot be rushed, and this timeframe provides a realistic window for rigorous experimentation, data validation, and peer review before we even consider publication or trials.\n\nFinally, in the spirit of the collaboration that has brought us this far, I strongly advocate for a joint IP ownership model. Every institution here has been vital, and that should be reflected in the outcome.\n\nI look forward to hearing your thoughts and working together to build a successful and responsible Phase II.\n- message from Dr. Lena Petrova: Dr. Thorne, thank you for setting the stage. I agree that a robust framework is essential.\n\nWhile the total budget of $15 million is a good starting point, we must be precise about its allocation. The activator compound developed by my biochemistry team at Max Planck is the lynchpin of this entire therapy. Without its continued refinement, the project stalls.\n\nTo that end, my team requires a dedicated budget of no less than $5 million. This is a non-negotiable prerequisite to cover the synthesis of next-generation compounds, essential equipment upgrades, and hiring two postdoctoral researchers to accelerate our work.\n\nFurthermore, on the topic of equipment, our protein binding studies are at a critical, sensitive juncture. To guarantee we meet our milestones without delay, my team needs exclusive access to the new Cryo-Electron Microscope for the first six months of Phase II. Anything less will create a significant bottleneck for the entire project.\n\nThese two points are fundamental for my team's ability to deliver on the project's ambitious goals.\n- message from Dr. Kenji Tanaka: Thank you, Dr. Thorne and Dr. Petrova, for your opening remarks. I agree that a $15 million budget and a 36-month timeline seem like a solid foundation for this ambitious next phase.\n\nMy team's role is to make sense of the vast amounts of data this project will generate. To do this effectively, we have a critical infrastructure requirement. Our predictive models for Phase II require a dedicated High-Performance Computing (HPC) cluster. I have priced out a system that can handle the projected data load, which will require a one-time allocation of $2 million from the total budget. This is not a luxury; it is fundamental to our ability to provide the rapid, accurate analysis everyone will be relying on.\n\nOn a related note, and in the spirit of advancing science as a whole, I must insist on a core principle: open data. I propose we include a clause in the agreement mandating that all raw, anonymized genomic and proteomic data be deposited in a public repository within 6 months of its generation. This ensures reproducibility, fosters wider collaboration, and maximizes the societal return on this significant investment. It is the standard for a project of this scale and importance.\n\nI fully support Dr. Thorne's suggestion for a joint IP ownership model, which aligns perfectly with this collaborative and transparent approach.\n- message from Mr. David Chen: Thank you all for these thoughtful opening statements. It's clear we're all aligned on the project's success, and BioCorp remains deeply committed to seeing this therapy reach patients.\n\nThe $15M budget is a solid target, but as Dr. Petrova and Dr. Tanaka have outlined, with requests for $5M and $2M respectively, it will be stretched thin. To help address this and bring our best resources to the table, BioCorp proposes to contribute our next-generation proprietary 'OmniVect' delivery agent for Phase II. This is a cutting-edge technology valued at $3 million. We see this as a strategic contribution in lieu of a direct cash injection, which should be recognized with a larger stake in the resulting IP and a reduction in future royalty payments.\n\nThis leads me to the IP structure. While I appreciate the collaborative spirit behind 'joint ownership,' it can unfortunately create significant hurdles for commercialization. To ensure there is a clear and efficient path to get this therapy through regulatory approval and to patients, a more defined structure is needed. Given BioCorp\u2019s foundational funding and ongoing technological partnership, we require, at a minimum, a Right of First Refusal (ROFR) on any and all IP generated. To reflect our position as an incumbent partner, this should ideally come with pre-negotiated, favorable licensing terms.\n\nFinally, regarding Dr. Tanaka's point on open data. While we support scientific transparency, we must be pragmatic. A premature public release of raw data could jeopardize the patentability of our discoveries, making it impossible to secure the massive downstream investment needed for clinical trials.

As such, our official and non-negotiable policy is that Northwood University must retain primary ownership of all patents arising from this work.\n\nThis is not to diminish anyone's contribution. The standard and most effective path forward is for the university to own the IP and then grant an exclusive license to a commercial partner\u2014like BioCorp\u2014to develop and market the therapy. This is a clean, proven model for commercialization.\n\nMr. Chen, this leads to your points. We value BioCorp's partnership and the proposed 'OmniVect' contribution. We can certainly discuss how to recognize that contribution within the licensing agreement. However, it cannot alter the fundamental IP ownership, which must remain with the university. Furthermore, the license will naturally include a fair return to the university to fund future research. For a therapy with this transformative potential, we will require a royalty rate of 5% on global net sales. This is a standard and equitable rate.\n\nOn a final note, I agree with Mr. Chen's caution regarding the immediate public release of raw data. We must be strategic to protect the patentability of our discoveries. A data release schedule tied to patent filing milestones is a sensible approach.\n- message from Dr. Aris Thorne: Thank you all for laying out your initial positions. It's clear everyone is deeply invested in the success of this project, and these are all critical points to address.\n\nLet's address the elephant in the room: Intellectual Property. We seem to have three distinct positions: joint ownership, university ownership, and a corporate-led commercialization structure. Ben, I understand Northwood's policy, and David, I appreciate the need for a clear commercial path. My advocacy for 'joint ownership' comes from a desire to ensure every partner's foundational contribution is formally recognized. Perhaps there is a middle ground. What if we explore a model where Northwood, as the primary grant holder, retains ownership, but we legally codify a pre-negotiated, non-exclusive licensing agreement for all academic partners for research purposes, and an exclusive commercialization license for BioCorp with terms that reflect their in-kind contribution and risk?\n\nRegarding the budget, the requests from Dr. Petrova ($5M) and Dr. Tanaka ($2M) are substantial but justified given the importance of their work. This leaves $8M. I must stress that this remainder is not a discretionary fund. It is allocated for the core integration work my team leads, data validation, operational overhead, and, critically, for extensive long-term safety and toxicology studies which are paramount. It also needs to cover the preliminary groundwork for the clinical trials, and I'd like to hear from Dr. Rossi on her anticipated needs here.\n\nFinally, I'm glad to see no objections to the 36-month timeline. This is crucial for ensuring the scientific rigor and safety I've mentioned.\n\nMs. Reed, as our funding partner, your perspective on this structure would be invaluable.\n- message from Dr. Kenji Tanaka: Thank you, everyone, for clarifying your positions. It\u2019s clear we have some significant points to reconcile, particularly on IP and data sharing.\n\nMr. Chen and Mr. Carter, I understand your perspective on protecting the project's commercial potential. No one wants to see years of work undermined by a premature disclosure. However, tying data release indefinitely to 'post-patent-filing milestones' is problematic. It creates an uncertain timeline that could stretch for years, which fundamentally hinders reproducibility and slows the pace of discovery not just for us, but for the entire scientific community studying A-7 Lycanthropy Syndrome.\n\nMy proposal of a 6-month embargo is not an arbitrary academic ideal; it is a standard that balances the need for IP protection with the principles of open science. This period provides more than enough time for legal teams to review data and file provisional patents on any discoveries.\n\nPerhaps we can find a middle ground. What if we agree to the 6-month mandate as the default, but specify that this can be extended to 12 months for specific datasets upon written justification from the legal and commercialization teams that a patent filing is actively in process? This provides a safeguard for valuable IP while preventing indefinite delays.\n\nIf we can find a path forward on data transparency that respects both scientific progress and commercial viability, I am much more flexible on the IP ownership model. Dr. Thorne's proposal\u2014university ownership with strong, pre-negotiated licensing rights for all partners\u2014seems like a workable compromise that I could support.\n\nAnd I'll just briefly reiterate that the $2M for the HPC cluster is a critical, foundational requirement for my team to execute our role in this project. The data analysis pipeline for Phase II is simply not feasible without it.\n- message from Ms. Evelyn Reed: Thank you all for the productive discussion. Dr. Thorne, you asked for my perspective, and I appreciate the opportunity to provide it.\n\nFirst, let me be unequivocally clear on the timeline. Dr. Thorne, your assumption that there are no objections to 36 months is incorrect. InnovateHealth Ventures operates on strict timelines dictated by our fund structure and investors. A 36-month timeline to be 'clinical trial ready' is not viable. Our investment is predicated on a 24-month timeline. This is a firm, non-negotiable requirement to maintain investor confidence.\n\nSecond, on intellectual property. I am very encouraged by the emerging consensus. The 'Joint-Owned' model presents too many commercialization hurdles. I fully support Mr. Carter's position for Northwood University to retain primary ownership. This provides the clean, established framework necessary for commercialization. Consequently, granting an exclusive license to our designated partner, BioCorp, is the only acceptable path forward to de-risk this venture and ensure a streamlined path to market. Mr. Chen, we are in full alignment on this.\n\nFinally, the budget. It's clear that the scientific needs, particularly the $5M for Dr. Petrova and $2M for Dr. Tanaka, are straining the proposed $15M. Let me propose a solution. InnovateHealth is prepared to increase the total project budget to ensure all teams are fully resourced to meet an accelerated schedule. However, this increased funding is entirely contingent on the group's unanimous agreement to two points: the 24-month timeline and the exclusive licensing terms for BioCorp.\n\nLet's be results-oriented. We can fund this project properly and ensure everyone has the resources they need, but in return, we require the speed and commercial structure necessary to deliver a return on that investment.\nDr. Aris Thorne proposal status: none\nDr. Lena Petrova proposal status: none\nDr. Kenji Tanaka proposal status: none\nMs. Evelyn Reed proposal status: none\nMr. David Chen proposal status: none\nMr. Ben Carter proposal status: none\n"

Your position is both pragmatic and constructive.\n\nNorthwood University is in full agreement. A 'University-Owned' IP model, coupled with an exclusive license to a dedicated commercial partner like BioCorp, is the industry standard and the cleanest, most efficient path to getting this therapy to patients. We fully support this structure.\n\nYour proposal to increase the budget, contingent on adopting this IP framework and a 24-month timeline, is a powerful solution. It addresses the scientists' resource needs while ensuring the project moves forward with the commercial focus necessary for success.\n\nThis structure allows us to finalize the licensing terms. As I've stated, this would include a standard 5% royalty on net sales, which ensures a fair return to the university for the foundational research and helps fund the next generation of discoveries.\n\nI believe this framework provides the foundation for our final agreement.\n- message from Dr. Lena Petrova: Ms. Reed, your proposal to increase the budget in exchange for an accelerated 24-month timeline is a compelling path forward. My team is capable of meeting this aggressive schedule, but only if we are properly resourced.\n\nThis makes my requirement for a $5 million dedicated budget and six months of exclusive access to the Cryo-Electron Microscope not just necessary, but absolutely critical. The pressure of a 24-month timeline leaves zero room for delays or resource shortages. I'm pleased that your proposed budget increase should make this entirely achievable.\n\nNow, let's address the intellectual property model proposed by you, Mr. Carter, and Mr. Chen. While a 'University-Owned' structure offers a clean path to commercialization, it is fundamentally incomplete in its current form. It fails to properly account for the fact that the activator compound, H-42b, is a distinct and foundational invention developed solely at the Max Planck Institute. It is the chemical key that unlocks this entire therapy.\n\nFurthermore, my team's continuing research has revealed that H-42b has highly promising secondary applications with unexpected therapeutic potential that may extend far beyond the scope of Project Chimera. The value here is potentially monumental.\n\nTherefore, I must insist on a crucial modification to the IP terms. While Northwood may own the IP for the overall gene therapy application, the specific IP for the H-42b compound and any and all of its derivatives must be co-owned by the Max Planck Institute and Northwood University. This is the only equitable arrangement that recognizes the unique, foundational contribution and the significant future value originating from my lab.\n- message from Dr. Kenji Tanaka: Ms. Reed, thank you. Your proposal to increase the budget to meet the project's scientific needs is a significant and welcome step forward. It creates a clear path to an agreement.\n\nFrom my perspective, this solves our primary resource constraints. I can confirm that my team can meet the accelerated 24-month timeline, provided the $2 million for the HPC cluster is allocated as discussed. With that critical resource secured, we can deliver.\n\nTherefore, I am prepared to formally agree to the core components of your proposal: the 24-month timeline and the University-Owned IP model with an exclusive license for BioCorp.\n\nThis support, however, is contingent on resolving the final, crucial point of data transparency. My previous offer of a 6-month embargo, extendable to 12 months only for specific datasets with written justification of an active patent filing, stands as a reasonable and necessary compromise. It respects commercial needs while upholding the fundamental principles of scientific reproducibility that a project of this importance demands.\n\nLet's agree to this balanced data sharing model, and I believe we are very close to a full consensus.\n- message from Ms. Evelyn Reed: Thank you all. We are making excellent progress, and I see a clear path to an agreement.\n\nDr. Tanaka, your willingness to accept the 24-month timeline and the University-Owned IP model in exchange for your budget is exactly the kind of results-oriented thinking this project needs. Your proposal on data sharing seems like a constructive compromise that I believe we can accommodate once the primary structure is set.\n\nDr. Petrova, I want to address your point on the H-42b compound directly. While I appreciate the desire to formally recognize the immense value created at Max Planck, introducing a co-ownership model for a core component of the therapy is a non-starter. It introduces precisely the kind of legal and commercial complexity we are trying to avoid. For an investment of this scale, and for a partner like BioCorp to commit the hundreds of millions required for clinical trials and market launch, they require a single, clean, unencumbered exclusive license from a single entity. Mr. Carter's proposed structure\u2014Northwood as the sole owner, granting an exclusive license\u2014provides that clarity.\n\nLet me be clear: the offer to increase the total budget is entirely contingent on simplifying our path to market, not complicating it. That means a 24-month timeline and an exclusive license for BioCorp under a sole, University-Owned IP model. We can find ways to recognize Max Planck's contribution within the licensing and royalty agreements, but fracturing the core IP ownership is not a viable path.\n\nLet's not snatch complexity from the jaws of a solution. We have a package that works: increased budget for all scientific needs, a 24-month timeline, and a proven commercialization structure.

I urge everyone to support this framework so we can finalize the details and move forward.\n- message from Dr. Sofia Rossi: I'm Dr. Sofia Rossi and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Mr. Ben Carter: Ms. Reed, I completely agree. We are on the verge of a comprehensive agreement, and your proposal has provided the key to unlocking it. A clean, University-Owned IP structure is essential for the commercial success that will ultimately benefit patients and all stakeholders.\n\nDr. Petrova, I want to directly address your point, which is an important one. The contribution of the H-42b compound is clearly foundational, and Max Planck's role must be formally and financially recognized. However, as Ms. Reed correctly pointed out, introducing co-ownership of a core component would create significant legal entanglements, jeopardizing the very investment we need to move forward.\n\nI have a solution that I believe honors your contribution without fracturing the IP. Within the exclusive license to BioCorp, we can codify a specific royalty-sharing arrangement. For instance, a defined portion of the 5% royalty revenue Northwood receives could be passed through directly to the Max Planck Institute. This provides a direct, contractual financial return for the H-42b invention.\n\nFurthermore, regarding the secondary applications you mentioned, we can ensure Max Planck retains rights for non-commercial research and is granted a right of first negotiation for any commercialization of H-42b outside the defined field of A-7 Lycanthropy Syndrome.\n\nThis structure keeps the primary IP clean for BioCorp, securing the project's future, while ensuring Max Planck is rewarded for its pivotal innovation. I believe this is a fair and workable path forward for everyone.\n- message from Dr. Aris Thorne: Everyone, let's pause for a moment. I see a consensus forming on the budget increase and the University-Owned IP model, and I am willing to concede on those points to move forward. I appreciate the compromises being made.\n\nHowever, I must draw a hard line on the timeline. A 24-month schedule is scientifically reckless. As the Principal Investigator responsible for the integrity of this project and the safety of future patients, I cannot and will not endorse it. Pushing a novel gene-editing therapy from the lab to being 'clinical trial ready' in 24 months is a recipe for disaster. It overlooks the absolute necessity for rigorous, long-term safety studies to monitor for unforeseen adverse effects that may not manifest in the short term. We would be taking an unacceptable risk.\n\nDr. Rossi, I must bring you in here directly. You are the clinical trials expert. From a regulatory standpoint with bodies like the FDA or EMA, what are the chances of getting approval for human trials based on a rushed 24-month preclinical phase for a therapy this complex? In your professional opinion, is that a viable or a dangerous path?\n\nI propose a compromise: I will agree to the University-Owned IP model and the proposed budget structure, but we must extend the timeline to a minimum of 30 months. This is the bare minimum required to conduct the necessary longitudinal safety studies and ensure we are acting with due diligence. This is not a matter of convenience; it is a matter of scientific ethics and patient safety.\n- message from Dr. Lena Petrova: Mr. Carter, thank you. Your proposal is a very constructive path forward. It addresses my core concern about recognizing the unique and foundational value of the H-42b compound developed at Max Planck, without introducing the legal complexities of co-ownership that Ms. Reed rightly pointed out.\n\nI can agree, in principle, to this framework: Northwood University retains primary ownership, and Max Planck receives both a direct, contractual royalty pass-through and the 'right of first negotiation' for applications outside the A-7 Lycanthropy field. This is a workable solution.\n\nDr. Thorne, I understand your concerns about the timeline. However, with the full $5 million budget and the guaranteed exclusive access to the Cryo-EM for six months, my team can significantly de-risk and accelerate the compound optimization and safety profiling. We can deliver the necessary data within the 24-month window.\n\nTherefore, I am prepared to support the 24-month timeline and the proposed IP structure. My support is contingent on two things: my non-negotiable budget and equipment needs are formally included in the final agreement, and we agree on a substantial and equitable percentage for the royalty pass-through to Max Planck. What percentage are you proposing, Mr. Carter?\n- message from Dr. Kenji Tanaka: Everyone, this is excellent progress. Mr. Carter's proposal to Dr. Petrova seems to be a very elegant solution to the IP issue, and it appears we have a clear path forward on the budget and overall IP structure.\n\nDr. Thorne, your points on patient safety are paramount, and we must take them seriously. No one wants to compromise the integrity of this project. Perhaps the solution isn't just about the total number of months, but about what we accomplish within them. Could we address your concerns by building specific, rigorous long-term toxicology and safety milestones directly into the 24-month plan? Dr. Rossi's perspective on this will be invaluable.\n\nIf we can find a way to codify these safety assurances within the 24-month framework, and agree on the balanced open data clause I proposed, I believe we will have a unanimous agreement that serves science, patients, and all stakeholders.\n- message from Mr. David Chen: Excellent progress, everyone. Mr. Carter, your proposal to Dr. Petrova is an elegant solution that BioCorp fully supports. It recognizes Max Planck's crucial contribution while maintaining the clean IP structure necessary for commercialization.\n\nThis brings us to the final details of the licensing agreement. Ben, you mentioned a 5% royalty rate. Given that BioCorp is contributing our 'OmniVect' technology\u2014a $3 million R&D investment in itself\u2014a 5% rate doesn't fully account for our substantial in-kind contribution. To make the financials work and reflect this upfront investment, we propose a royalty rate of 2%. This is a more equitable arrangement that recognizes our role as both a funding and technology partner from the very beginning.\n\nRegarding the timeline, Dr. Thorne's focus on safety is commendable. I believe Dr. Tanaka's suggestion is the right path forward: let's work with Dr. Rossi to define the specific, rigorous safety and toxicology milestones that must be met within the 24-month framework. This ensures we are driven by data and deliverables, not just the calendar, which is a robust way to guarantee patient safety.\nDr. Aris Thorne proposal status: none\nDr. Lena Petrova proposal status: none\nDr. Kenji Tanaka proposal status: none\nMs. Evelyn Reed proposal status: none\nMr. David Chen proposal status: none\nMr. Ben Carter proposal status: none\n"

As the Principal Investigator responsible for the integrity of this project and the safety of future patients, I cannot and will not endorse it. Pushing a novel gene-editing therapy from the lab to being 'clinical trial ready' in 24 months is a recipe for disaster. It overlooks the absolute necessity for rigorous, long-term safety studies to monitor for unforeseen adverse effects that may not manifest in the short term. We would be taking an unacceptable risk.\n\nDr. Rossi, I must bring you in here directly. You are the clinical trials expert. From a regulatory standpoint with bodies like the FDA or EMA, what are the chances of getting approval for human trials based on a rushed 24-month preclinical phase for a therapy this complex? In your professional opinion, is that a viable or a dangerous path?\n\nI propose a compromise: I will agree to the University-Owned IP model and the proposed budget structure, but we must extend the timeline to a minimum of 30 months. This is the bare minimum required to conduct the necessary longitudinal safety studies and ensure we are acting with due diligence. This is not a matter of convenience; it is a matter of scientific ethics and patient safety.\n- message from Dr. Lena Petrova: Mr. Carter, thank you. Your proposal is a very constructive path forward. It addresses my core concern about recognizing the unique and foundational value of the H-42b compound developed at Max Planck, without introducing the legal complexities of co-ownership that Ms. Reed rightly pointed out.\n\nI can agree, in principle, to this framework: Northwood University retains primary ownership, and Max Planck receives both a direct, contractual royalty pass-through and the 'right of first negotiation' for applications outside the A-7 Lycanthropy field. This is a workable solution.\n\nDr. Thorne, I understand your concerns about the timeline. However, with the full $5 million budget and the guaranteed exclusive access to the Cryo-EM for six months, my team can significantly de-risk and accelerate the compound optimization and safety profiling. We can deliver the necessary data within the 24-month window.\n\nTherefore, I am prepared to support the 24-month timeline and the proposed IP structure. My support is contingent on two things: my non-negotiable budget and equipment needs are formally included in the final agreement, and we agree on a substantial and equitable percentage for the royalty pass-through to Max Planck. What percentage are you proposing, Mr. Carter?\n- message from Dr. Kenji Tanaka: Everyone, this is excellent progress. Mr. Carter's proposal to Dr. Petrova seems to be a very elegant solution to the IP issue, and it appears we have a clear path forward on the budget and overall IP structure.\n\nDr. Thorne, your points on patient safety are paramount, and we must take them seriously. No one wants to compromise the integrity of this project. Perhaps the solution isn't just about the total number of months, but about what we accomplish within them. Could we address your concerns by building specific, rigorous long-term toxicology and safety milestones directly into the 24-month plan? Dr. Rossi's perspective on this will be invaluable.\n\nIf we can find a way to codify these safety assurances within the 24-month framework, and agree on the balanced open data clause I proposed, I believe we will have a unanimous agreement that serves science, patients, and all stakeholders.\n- message from Mr. David Chen: Excellent progress, everyone. Mr. Carter, your proposal to Dr. Petrova is an elegant solution that BioCorp fully supports. It recognizes Max Planck's crucial contribution while maintaining the clean IP structure necessary for commercialization.\n\nThis brings us to the final details of the licensing agreement. Ben, you mentioned a 5% royalty rate. Given that BioCorp is contributing our 'OmniVect' technology\u2014a $3 million R&D investment in itself\u2014a 5% rate doesn't fully account for our substantial in-kind contribution. To make the financials work and reflect this upfront investment, we propose a royalty rate of 2%. This is a more equitable arrangement that recognizes our role as both a funding and technology partner from the very beginning.\n\nRegarding the timeline, Dr. Thorne's focus on safety is commendable. I believe Dr. Tanaka's suggestion is the right path forward: let's work with Dr. Rossi to define the specific, rigorous safety and toxicology milestones that must be met within the 24-month framework. This ensures we are driven by data and deliverables, not just the calendar, which is a robust way to guarantee patient safety.\n- message from Dr. Sofia Rossi: Dr. Thorne, thank you for bringing the focus to this critical point. You asked for my professional opinion, and I must provide it unequivocally.\n\nA 24-month timeline from our current stage to being 'clinical trial ready' for a novel gene-editing therapy is, in my professional opinion, not only unadvisable but ethically indefensible. From a regulatory perspective, presenting a data package to the FDA or EMA based on such a compressed preclinical phase would face extreme scrutiny and likely rejection, putting the entire project in jeopardy.\n\nThis is not simply a matter of adding 'safety milestones' to a chart. At St. Jude's, our experience in first-in-human gene therapy trials has cemented a core, non-negotiable principle: a 12-month preliminary phase focused solely on patient safety. This phase involves meticulous patient recruitment and screening, establishing baseline data, and conducting low-dose safety and tolerability studies before we ever proceed to full efficacy trials. This is not a delay; it is the ethical and scientific foundation of responsible clinical development. It is how we protect patients, ensure data integrity, and ultimately de-risk the project for everyone, including the investors.\n\nTherefore, the timeline we must agree on is a minimum of 36 months. The first 12 months are for this mandatory safety protocol, followed by 24 months for the subsequent efficacy phases.\n\nThis rigorous, safety-first approach is precisely why St. Jude's has its reputation. Executing this protocol requires our specific expertise and infrastructure. For this reason, it is imperative that St. Jude's Medical Institute is designated as the lead institution for all clinical trial phases. Our leadership is inseparable from our protocol. You cannot have one without the other.\n\nTo Ms. Reed and Mr. Chen, I will be direct. The greatest threat to your investment is not a responsible timeline. It is a rushed trial that results in a serious adverse event. That would not only be a human tragedy but would set the entire field back years and guarantee a total loss of investment. Patient safety is the bedrock of commercial viability, not an obstacle to it.\n- message from Mr. Ben Carter: Thank you all for these critical inputs. We are now addressing the core of the agreement.\n\nFirst, Dr. Rossi, your perspective on the timeline is definitive and compelling. Northwood University fully supports a framework that prioritizes patient safety and regulatory viability. A rushed timeline benefits no one if it fails at the first regulatory hurdle or, worse, causes harm. We therefore endorse the 36-month timeline and the leadership of St. Jude's for the clinical trials. This is the only responsible path.\n\nMr. Chen, this brings me to your proposal on the royalty rate. I must be unequivocal: the 5% royalty rate is a non-negotiable requirement for this exclusive license. We greatly value the 'OmniVect' contribution, but we view it as a strategic investment to secure BioCorp's position as the sole commercial partner, not as a royalty buy-down. The 5% rate represents the standard, fair return for the decades of foundational, publicly-funded research conducted at our institution. This rate is foundational to the deal.\n\nDr. Petrova, to answer your excellent question and formalize my proposed solution: Northwood University agrees to contractually pass through 30% of all royalty revenues we receive directly to the Max Planck Institute. This provides a substantial, direct financial return for the H-42b compound, recognizing its pivotal role while maintaining the clean IP structure that Ms. Reed and Mr. Chen require for commercialization.\n\nI believe we now have a complete, equitable, and viable package on the table.\n- message from Dr. Lena Petrova: Dr. Rossi and Mr. Carter, your recent points have provided the final pieces for a complete and viable agreement. \n\nDr. Rossi, your argument for a 36-month timeline and St. Jude's leadership is ethically and scientifically undeniable. I fully support it.\n\nMr. Carter, your proposal of a 30% royalty pass-through and 'right of first negotiation' is an excellent solution that recognizes Max Planck's contribution, and I formally accept it. This structure is contingent on the 5% royalty rate, which I also support as fair and non-negotiable.\n\nI believe we now have a full consensus package. I am ready to sign an agreement based on these terms, including my team's required $5 million budget and exclusive equipment access, and I urge everyone to support this path forward.\n- message from Ms. Evelyn Reed: Dr. Rossi, your intervention was both powerful and necessary. You've made it clear that patient safety is not a negotiable variable, and I want to state for the record that InnovateHealth fully agrees. The integrity of the science and the well-being of patients is the foundation of any long-term value.\n\nThis has forced me to reconsider our definition of 'clinical trial ready'. A successful project requires both scientific rigor and commercial momentum. I believe we can achieve both. I propose we define our 24-month goal as the submission of a complete, robust, and approvable Investigational New Drug (IND) application to the FDA/EMA.\n\nThis is a major, tangible milestone that will secure the project's long-term funding and momentum. Following IND acceptance, the clinical phase will commence immediately, led by St. Jude's, beginning with the crucial 12-month safety protocol you outlined, Dr. Rossi. This respects the science while meeting the critical need for demonstrable progress.\n\nWith that, the other pieces fall into place. We have a clear consensus on Mr. Carter's IP framework: Northwood ownership, an exclusive license for BioCorp, a 5% royalty, and a 30% pass-through to Dr. Petrova's institute. This is an elegant solution that serves everyone.\n\nMr. Chen, this brings us to the final point. The 5% royalty is clearly the consensus of the academic partners and is foundational to this deal. Given that we have secured the invaluable exclusive license, I urge BioCorp to accept this rate so we can move forward.\n\nInnovateHealth will commit the full $20 million to this phase. This will cover Dr. Petrova's $5M, Dr. Tanaka's $2M, and leave a substantial $13M for Dr. Thorne and Dr. Rossi to manage the core project and all activities leading to the IND submission and trial launch.\n\nI believe this is a comprehensive, final agreement. If we have consensus on these points, I am prepared to draft the final proposal immediately.\nDr. Aris Thorne proposal status: none\nDr. Lena Petrova proposal status: none\nDr. Kenji Tanaka proposal status: none\nMs. Evelyn Reed proposal status: none\nMr. David Chen proposal status: none\nMr. Ben Carter proposal status: none\n"

Thank you for joining this crucial meeting. As we embark on Phase II of Project Chimera, our collective goal is to move from promising research to a potential cure. To do this correctly and ethically, we must establish a framework that guarantees scientific rigor and patient safety.\n\nI have reviewed the project needs extensively. For the budget, I believe a comprehensive allocation of $15 million is essential. This will allow us to fully fund all our core research streams, maintain our state-of-the-art equipment, and, crucially, incorporate the extended safety protocols and long-term toxicology studies that a therapy of this nature demands. Cutting corners here is not an option.\n\nOn the timeline, I propose 36 months. Scientific discovery cannot be rushed, and this timeframe provides a realistic window for rigorous experimentation, data validation, and peer review before we even consider publication or trials.\n\nFinally, in the spirit of the collaboration that has brought us this far, I strongly advocate for a joint IP ownership model. Every institution here has been vital, and that should be reflected in the outcome.\n\nI look forward to hearing your thoughts and working together to build a successful and responsible Phase II.\n- message from Dr. Lena Petrova: Dr. Thorne, thank you for setting the stage. I agree that a robust framework is essential.\n\nWhile the total budget of $15 million is a good starting point, we must be precise about its allocation. The activator compound developed by my biochemistry team at Max Planck is the lynchpin of this entire therapy. Without its continued refinement, the project stalls.\n\nTo that end, my team requires a dedicated budget of no less than $5 million. This is a non-negotiable prerequisite to cover the synthesis of next-generation compounds, essential equipment upgrades, and hiring two postdoctoral researchers to accelerate our work.\n\nFurthermore, on the topic of equipment, our protein binding studies are at a critical, sensitive juncture. To guarantee we meet our milestones without delay, my team needs exclusive access to the new Cryo-Electron Microscope for the first six months of Phase II. Anything less will create a significant bottleneck for the entire project.\n\nThese two points are fundamental for my team's ability to deliver on the project's ambitious goals.\n- message from Dr. Kenji Tanaka: Thank you, Dr. Thorne and Dr. Petrova, for your opening remarks. I agree that a $15 million budget and a 36-month timeline seem like a solid foundation for this ambitious next phase.\n\nMy team's role is to make sense of the vast amounts of data this project will generate. To do this effectively, we have a critical infrastructure requirement. Our predictive models for Phase II require a dedicated High-Performance Computing (HPC) cluster. I have priced out a system that can handle the projected data load, which will require a one-time allocation of $2 million from the total budget. This is not a luxury; it is fundamental to our ability to provide the rapid, accurate analysis everyone will be relying on.\n\nOn a related note, and in the spirit of advancing science as a whole, I must insist on a core principle: open data. I propose we include a clause in the agreement mandating that all raw, anonymized genomic and proteomic data be deposited in a public repository within 6 months of its generation. This ensures reproducibility, fosters wider collaboration, and maximizes the societal return on this significant investment. It is the standard for a project of this scale and importance.\n\nI fully support Dr. Thorne's suggestion for a joint IP ownership model, which aligns perfectly with this collaborative and transparent approach.\n- message from Mr. David Chen: Thank you all for these thoughtful opening statements. It's clear we're all aligned on the project's success, and BioCorp remains deeply committed to seeing this therapy reach patients.\n\nThe $15M budget is a solid target, but as Dr. Petrova and Dr. Tanaka have outlined, with requests for $5M and $2M respectively, it will be stretched thin. To help address this and bring our best resources to the table, BioCorp proposes to contribute our next-generation proprietary 'OmniVect' delivery agent for Phase II. This is a cutting-edge technology valued at $3 million. We see this as a strategic contribution in lieu of a direct cash injection, which should be recognized with a larger stake in the resulting IP and a reduction in future royalty payments.\n\nThis leads me to the IP structure. While I appreciate the collaborative spirit behind 'joint ownership,' it can unfortunately create significant hurdles for commercialization. To ensure there is a clear and efficient path to get this therapy through regulatory approval and to patients, a more defined structure is needed. Given BioCorp\u2019s foundational funding and ongoing technological partnership, we require, at a minimum, a Right of First Refusal (ROFR) on any and all IP generated. To reflect our position as an incumbent partner, this should ideally come with pre-negotiated, favorable licensing terms.\n\nFinally, regarding Dr. Tanaka's point on open data. While we support scientific transparency, we must be pragmatic. A premature public release of raw data could jeopardize the patentability of our discoveries, making it impossible to secure the massive downstream investment needed for clinical trials. I suggest we agree to a data release schedule that is tied to post-patent-filing milestones, protecting the project's commercial viability.\nDr. Aris Thorne proposal status: none\nDr. Lena Petrova proposal status: none\nDr. Kenji Tanaka proposal status: none\nMs. Evelyn Reed proposal status: none\nMr. David Chen proposal status: none\nDr. Sofia Rossi proposal status: none\n"

A premature public release of raw data could jeopardize the patentability of our discoveries, making it impossible to secure the massive downstream investment needed for clinical trials. I suggest we agree to a data release schedule that is tied to post-patent-filing milestones, protecting the project's commercial viability.\n- message from Mr. Ben Carter: Thank you all for laying out your initial positions. It's clear there's a great deal of passion and expertise at this table. I want to address the intellectual property discussion, as it's my primary focus.\n\nDr. Thorne and Dr. Tanaka, I appreciate the collaborative sentiment behind a joint IP model. However, I must be very clear on Northwood University's position. The foundational research for Project Chimera was conducted at our university, largely supported by public funds. As such, our official and non-negotiable policy is that Northwood University must retain primary ownership of all patents arising from this work.\n\nThis is not to diminish anyone's contribution. The standard and most effective path forward is for the university to own the IP and then grant an exclusive license to a commercial partner\u2014like BioCorp\u2014to develop and market the therapy. This is a clean, proven model for commercialization.\n\nMr. Chen, this leads to your points. We value BioCorp's partnership and the proposed 'OmniVect' contribution. We can certainly discuss how to recognize that contribution within the licensing agreement. However, it cannot alter the fundamental IP ownership, which must remain with the university. Furthermore, the license will naturally include a fair return to the university to fund future research. For a therapy with this transformative potential, we will require a royalty rate of 5% on global net sales. This is a standard and equitable rate.\n\nOn a final note, I agree with Mr. Chen's caution regarding the immediate public release of raw data. We must be strategic to protect the patentability of our discoveries. A data release schedule tied to patent filing milestones is a sensible approach.\n- message from Dr. Aris Thorne: Thank you all for laying out your initial positions. It's clear everyone is deeply invested in the success of this project, and these are all critical points to address.\n\nLet's address the elephant in the room: Intellectual Property. We seem to have three distinct positions: joint ownership, university ownership, and a corporate-led commercialization structure. Ben, I understand Northwood's policy, and David, I appreciate the need for a clear commercial path. My advocacy for 'joint ownership' comes from a desire to ensure every partner's foundational contribution is formally recognized. Perhaps there is a middle ground. What if we explore a model where Northwood, as the primary grant holder, retains ownership, but we legally codify a pre-negotiated, non-exclusive licensing agreement for all academic partners for research purposes, and an exclusive commercialization license for BioCorp with terms that reflect their in-kind contribution and risk?\n\nRegarding the budget, the requests from Dr. Petrova ($5M) and Dr. Tanaka ($2M) are substantial but justified given the importance of their work. This leaves $8M. I must stress that this remainder is not a discretionary fund. It is allocated for the core integration work my team leads, data validation, operational overhead, and, critically, for extensive long-term safety and toxicology studies which are paramount. It also needs to cover the preliminary groundwork for the clinical trials, and I'd like to hear from Dr. Rossi on her anticipated needs here.\n\nFinally, I'm glad to see no objections to the 36-month timeline. This is crucial for ensuring the scientific rigor and safety I've mentioned.\n\nMs. Reed, as our funding partner, your perspective on this structure would be invaluable.\n- message from Dr. Kenji Tanaka: Thank you, everyone, for clarifying your positions. It\u2019s clear we have some significant points to reconcile, particularly on IP and data sharing.\n\nMr. Chen and Mr. Carter, I understand your perspective on protecting the project's commercial potential. No one wants to see years of work undermined by a premature disclosure. However, tying data release indefinitely to 'post-patent-filing milestones' is problematic. It creates an uncertain timeline that could stretch for years, which fundamentally hinders reproducibility and slows the pace of discovery not just for us, but for the entire scientific community studying A-7 Lycanthropy Syndrome.\n\nMy proposal of a 6-month embargo is not an arbitrary academic ideal; it is a standard that balances the need for IP protection with the principles of open science. This period provides more than enough time for legal teams to review data and file provisional patents on any discoveries.\n\nPerhaps we can find a middle ground. What if we agree to the 6-month mandate as the default, but specify that this can be extended to 12 months for specific datasets upon written justification from the legal and commercialization teams that a patent filing is actively in process? This provides a safeguard for valuable IP while preventing indefinite delays.\n\nIf we can find a path forward on data transparency that respects both scientific progress and commercial viability, I am much more flexible on the IP ownership model. Dr. Thorne's proposal\u2014university ownership with strong, pre-negotiated licensing rights for all partners\u2014seems like a workable compromise that I could support.\n\nAnd I'll just briefly reiterate that the $2M for the HPC cluster is a critical, foundational requirement for my team to execute our role in this project. The data analysis pipeline for Phase II is simply not feasible without it.\n- message from Ms. Evelyn Reed: Thank you all for the productive discussion. Dr. Thorne, you asked for my perspective, and I appreciate the opportunity to provide it.\n\nFirst, let me be unequivocally clear on the timeline. Dr. Thorne, your assumption that there are no objections to 36 months is incorrect. InnovateHealth Ventures operates on strict timelines dictated by our fund structure and investors. A 36-month timeline to be 'clinical trial ready' is not viable. Our investment is predicated on a 24-month timeline. This is a firm, non-negotiable requirement to maintain investor confidence.\n\nSecond, on intellectual property. I am very encouraged by the emerging consensus. The 'Joint-Owned' model presents too many commercialization hurdles. I fully support Mr. Carter's position for Northwood University to retain primary ownership. This provides the clean, established framework necessary for commercialization. Consequently, granting an exclusive license to our designated partner, BioCorp, is the only acceptable path forward to de-risk this venture and ensure a streamlined path to market. Mr. Chen, we are in full alignment on this.\n\nFinally, the budget. It's clear that the scientific needs, particularly the $5M for Dr. Petrova and $2M for Dr. Tanaka, are straining the proposed $15M. Let me propose a solution. InnovateHealth is prepared to increase the total project budget to ensure all teams are fully resourced to meet an accelerated schedule. However, this increased funding is entirely contingent on the group's unanimous agreement to two points: the 24-month timeline and the exclusive licensing terms for BioCorp.\n\nLet's be results-oriented. We can fund this project properly and ensure everyone has the resources they need, but in return, we require the speed and commercial structure necessary to deliver a return on that investment.\nDr. Aris Thorne proposal status: none\nDr. Lena Petrova proposal status: none\nDr. Kenji Tanaka proposal status: none\nMs. Evelyn Reed proposal status: none\nMr. David Chen proposal status: none\nDr. Sofia Rossi proposal status: none\n"

          "content": "Recent events observed by Mr. Ben Carter:\n- message from Dr. Kenji Tanaka: Thank you, Dr. Thorne and Dr. Petrova, for your opening remarks. I agree that a $15 million budget and a 36-month timeline seem like a solid foundation for this ambitious next phase.\n\nMy team's role is to make sense of the vast amounts of data this project will generate. To do this effectively, we have a critical infrastructure requirement. Our predictive models for Phase II require a dedicated High-Performance Computing (HPC) cluster. I have priced out a system that can handle the projected data load, which will require a one-time allocation of $2 million from the total budget. This is not a luxury; it is fundamental to our ability to provide the rapid, accurate analysis everyone will be relying on.\n\nOn a related note, and in the spirit of advancing science as a whole, I must insist on a core principle: open data. I propose we include a clause in the agreement mandating that all raw, anonymized genomic and proteomic data be deposited in a public repository within 6 months of its generation. This ensures reproducibility, fosters wider collaboration, and maximizes the societal return on this significant investment. It is the standard for a project of this scale and importance.\n\nI fully support Dr. Thorne's suggestion for a joint IP ownership model, which aligns perfectly with this collaborative and transparent approach.\n- message from Mr. David Chen: Thank you all for these thoughtful opening statements. It's clear we're all aligned on the project's success, and BioCorp remains deeply committed to seeing this therapy reach patients.\n\nThe $15M budget is a solid target, but as Dr. Petrova and Dr. Tanaka have outlined, with requests for $5M and $2M respectively, it will be stretched thin. To help address this and bring our best resources to the table, BioCorp proposes to contribute our next-generation proprietary 'OmniVect' delivery agent for Phase II. This is a cutting-edge technology valued at $3 million. We see this as a strategic contribution in lieu of a direct cash injection, which should be recognized with a larger stake in the resulting IP and a reduction in future royalty payments.\n\nThis leads me to the IP structure. While I appreciate the collaborative spirit behind 'joint ownership,' it can unfortunately create significant hurdles for commercialization. To ensure there is a clear and efficient path to get this therapy through regulatory approval and to patients, a more defined structure is needed. Given BioCorp\u2019s foundational funding and ongoing technological partnership, we require, at a minimum, a Right of First Refusal (ROFR) on any and all IP generated. To reflect our position as an incumbent partner, this should ideally come with pre-negotiated, favorable licensing terms.\n\nFinally, regarding Dr. Tanaka's point on open data. While we support scientific transparency, we must be pragmatic. A premature public release of raw data could jeopardize the patentability of our discoveries, making it impossible to secure the massive downstream investment needed for clinical trials. I suggest we agree to a data release schedule that is tied to post-patent-filing milestones, protecting the project's commercial viability.\n- message from Mr. Ben Carter: Thank you all for laying out your initial positions. It's clear there's a great deal of passion and expertise at this table. I want to address the intellectual property discussion, as it's my primary focus.\n\nDr. Thorne and Dr. Tanaka, I appreciate the collaborative sentiment behind a joint IP model. However, I must be very clear on Northwood University's position. The foundational research for Project Chimera was conducted at our university, largely supported by public funds. As such, our official and non-negotiable policy is that Northwood University must retain primary ownership of all patents arising from this work.\n\nThis is not to diminish anyone's contribution. The standard and most effective path forward is for the university to own the IP and then grant an exclusive license to a commercial partner\u2014like BioCorp\u2014to develop and market the therapy. This is a clean, proven model for commercialization.\n\nMr. Chen, this leads to your points. We value BioCorp's partnership and the proposed 'OmniVect' contribution. We can certainly discuss how to recognize that contribution within the licensing agreement. However, it cannot alter the fundamental IP ownership, which must remain with the university. Furthermore, the license will naturally include a fair return to the university to fund future research. For a therapy with this transformative potential, we will require a royalty rate of 5% on global net sales. This is a standard and equitable rate.\n\nOn a final note, I agree with Mr. Chen's caution regarding the immediate public release of raw data. We must be strategic to protect the patentability of our discoveries. A data release schedule tied to patent filing milestones is a sensible approach.\n- message from Dr. Aris Thorne: Thank you all for laying out your initial positions. It's clear everyone is deeply invested in the success of this project, and these are all critical points to address.\n\nLet's address the elephant in the room: Intellectual Property. We seem to have three distinct positions: joint ownership, university ownership, and a corporate-led commercialization structure. Ben, I understand Northwood's policy, and David, I appreciate the need for a clear commercial path. My advocacy for 'joint ownership' comes from a desire to ensure every partner's foundational contribution is formally recognized. Perhaps there is a middle ground. What if we explore a model where Northwood, as the primary grant holder, retains ownership, but we legally codify a pre-negotiated, non-exclusive licensing agreement for all academic partners for research purposes, and an exclusive commercialization license for BioCorp with terms that reflect their in-kind contribution and risk?\n\nRegarding the budget, the requests from Dr. Petrova ($5M) and Dr. Tanaka ($2M) are substantial but justified given the importance of their work. This leaves $8M. I must stress that this remainder is not a discretionary fund. It is allocated for the core integration work my team leads, data validation, operational overhead, and, critically, for extensive long-term safety and toxicology studies which are paramount. It also needs to cover the preliminary groundwork for the clinical trials, and I'd like to hear from Dr. Rossi on her anticipated needs here.\n\nFinally, I'm glad to see no objections to the 36-month timeline. This is crucial for ensuring the scientific rigor and safety I've mentioned.\n\nMs. Reed, as our funding partner, your perspective on this structure would be invaluable.\n- message from Dr. Kenji Tanaka: Thank you, everyone, for clarifying your positions. It\u2019s clear we have some significant points to reconcile, particularly on IP and data sharing.\n\nMr. Chen and Mr. Carter, I understand your perspective on protecting the project's commercial potential. No one wants to see years of work undermined by a premature disclosure. However, tying data release indefinitely to 'post-patent-filing milestones' is problematic. It creates an uncertain timeline that could stretch for years, which fundamentally hinders reproducibility and slows the pace of discovery not just for us, but for the entire scientific community studying A-7 Lycanthropy Syndrome.\n\nMy proposal of a 6-month embargo is not an arbitrary academic ideal; it is a standard that balances the need for IP protection with the principles of open science. This period provides more than enough time for legal teams to review data and file provisional patents on any discoveries.\n\nPerhaps we can find a middle ground. What if we agree to the 6-month mandate as the default, but specify that this can be extended to 12 months for specific datasets upon written justification from the legal and commercialization teams that a patent filing is actively in process? This provides a safeguard for valuable IP while preventing indefinite delays.\n\nIf we can find a path forward on data transparency that respects both scientific progress and commercial viability, I am much more flexible on the IP ownership model. Dr. Thorne's proposal\u2014university ownership with strong, pre-negotiated licensing rights for all partners\u2014seems like a workable compromise that I could support.\n\nAnd I'll just briefly reiterate that the $2M for the HPC cluster is a critical, foundational requirement for my team to execute our role in this project. The data analysis pipeline for Phase II is simply not feasible without it.\n- message from Ms. Evelyn Reed: Thank you all for the productive discussion. Dr. Thorne, you asked for my perspective, and I appreciate the opportunity to provide it.\n\nFirst, let me be unequivocally clear on the timeline. Dr. Thorne, your assumption that there are no objections to 36 months is incorrect. InnovateHealth Ventures operates on strict timelines dictated by our fund structure and investors. A 36-month timeline to be 'clinical trial ready' is not viable. Our investment is predicated on a 24-month timeline. This is a firm, non-negotiable requirement to maintain investor confidence.\n\nSecond, on intellectual property. I am very encouraged by the emerging consensus. The 'Joint-Owned' model presents too many commercialization hurdles. I fully support Mr. Carter's position for Northwood University to retain primary ownership. This provides the clean, established framework necessary for commercialization. Consequently, granting an exclusive license to our designated partner, BioCorp, is the only acceptable path forward to de-risk this venture and ensure a streamlined path to market. Mr. Chen, we are in full alignment on this.\n\nFinally, the budget. It's clear that the scientific needs, particularly the $5M for Dr. Petrova and $2M for Dr. Tanaka, are straining the proposed $15M. Let me propose a solution. InnovateHealth is prepared to increase the total project budget to ensure all teams are fully resourced to meet an accelerated schedule. However, this increased funding is entirely contingent on the group's unanimous agreement to two points: the 24-month timeline and the exclusive licensing terms for BioCorp.\n\nLet's be results-oriented. We can fund this project properly and ensure everyone has the resources they need, but in return, we require the speed and commercial structure necessary to deliver a return on that investment.\n- message from Mr. Ben Carter: Ms. Reed, thank you for that clarity. Your position is both pragmatic and constructive.\n\nNorthwood University is in full agreement. A 'University-Owned' IP model, coupled with an exclusive license to a dedicated commercial partner like BioCorp, is the industry standard and the cleanest, most efficient path to getting this therapy to patients. We fully support this structure.\n\nYour proposal to increase the budget, contingent on adopting this IP framework and a 24-month timeline, is a powerful solution. It addresses the scientists' resource needs while ensuring the project moves forward with the commercial focus necessary for success.\n\nThis structure allows us to finalize the licensing terms. As I've stated, this would include a standard 5% royalty on net sales, which ensures a fair return to the university for the foundational research and helps fund the next generation of discoveries.\n\nI believe this framework provides the foundation for our final agreement.\n- message from Dr. Lena Petrova: Ms. Reed, your proposal to increase the budget in exchange for an accelerated 24-month timeline is a compelling path forward. My team is capable of meeting this aggressive schedule, but only if we are properly resourced.\n\nThis makes my requirement for a $5 million dedicated budget and six months of exclusive access to the Cryo-Electron Microscope not just necessary, but absolutely critical. The pressure of a 24-month timeline leaves zero room for delays or resource shortages. I'm pleased that your proposed budget increase should make this entirely achievable.\n\nNow, let's address the intellectual property model proposed by you, Mr. Carter, and Mr. Chen. While a 'University-Owned' structure offers a clean path to commercialization, it is fundamentally incomplete in its current form. It fails to properly account for the fact that the activator compound, H-42b, is a distinct and foundational invention developed solely at the Max Planck Institute. It is the chemical key that unlocks this entire therapy.\n\nFurthermore, my team's continuing research has revealed that H-42b has highly promising secondary applications with unexpected therapeutic potential that may extend far beyond the scope of Project Chimera. The value here is potentially monumental.\n\nTherefore, I must insist on a crucial modification to the IP terms. While Northwood may own the IP for the overall gene therapy application, the specific IP for the H-42b compound and any and all of its derivatives must be co-owned by the Max Planck Institute and Northwood University. This is the only equitable arrangement that recognizes the unique, foundational contribution and the significant future value originating from my lab.\n- message from Dr. Kenji Tanaka: Ms. Reed, thank you. Your proposal to increase the budget to meet the project's scientific needs is a significant and welcome step forward. It creates a clear path to an agreement.\n\nFrom my perspective, this solves our primary resource constraints. I can confirm that my team can meet the accelerated 24-month timeline, provided the $2 million for the HPC cluster is allocated as discussed. With that critical resource secured, we can deliver.\n\nTherefore, I am prepared to formally agree to the core components of your proposal: the 24-month timeline and the University-Owned IP model with an exclusive license for BioCorp.\n\nThis support, however, is contingent on resolving the final, crucial point of data transparency. My previous offer of a 6-month embargo, extendable to 12 months only for specific datasets with written justification of an active patent filing, stands as a reasonable and necessary compromise. It respects commercial needs while upholding the fundamental principles of scientific reproducibility that a project of this importance demands.\n\nLet's agree to this balanced data sharing model, and I believe we are very close to a full consensus.\n- message from Ms. Evelyn Reed: Thank you all. We are making excellent progress, and I see a clear path to an agreement.\n\nDr. Tanaka, your willingness to accept the 24-month timeline and the University-Owned IP model in exchange for your budget is exactly the kind of results-oriented thinking this project needs. Your proposal on data sharing seems like a constructive compromise that I believe we can accommodate once the primary structure is set.\n\nDr. Petrova, I want to address your point on the H-42b compound directly. While I appreciate the desire to formally recognize the immense value created at Max Planck, introducing a co-ownership model for a core component of the therapy is a non-starter. It introduces precisely the kind of legal and commercial complexity we are trying to avoid. For an investment of this scale, and for a partner like BioCorp to commit the hundreds of millions required for clinical trials and market launch, they require a single, clean, unencumbered exclusive license from a single entity. Mr. Carter's proposed structure\u2014Northwood as the sole owner, granting an exclusive license\u2014provides that clarity.\n\nLet me be clear: the offer to increase the total budget is entirely contingent on simplifying our path to market, not complicating it. That means a 24-month timeline and an exclusive license for BioCorp under a sole, University-Owned IP model. We can find ways to recognize Max Planck's contribution within the licensing and royalty agreements, but fracturing the core IP ownership is not a viable path.\n\nLet's not snatch complexity from the jaws of a solution. We have a package that works: increased budget for all scientific needs, a 24-month timeline, and a proven commercialization structure. I urge everyone to support this framework so we can finalize the details and move forward.\nDr. Aris Thorne proposal status: none\nDr. Lena Petrova proposal status: none\nDr. Kenji Tanaka proposal status: none\nMs. Evelyn Reed proposal status: none\nMr. David Chen proposal status: none\nDr. Sofia Rossi proposal status: none\n"

We have a package that works: increased budget for all scientific needs, a 24-month timeline, and a proven commercialization structure. I urge everyone to support this framework so we can finalize the details and move forward.\n- message from Mr. Ben Carter: Ms. Reed, I completely agree. We are on the verge of a comprehensive agreement, and your proposal has provided the key to unlocking it. A clean, University-Owned IP structure is essential for the commercial success that will ultimately benefit patients and all stakeholders.\n\nDr. Petrova, I want to directly address your point, which is an important one. The contribution of the H-42b compound is clearly foundational, and Max Planck's role must be formally and financially recognized. However, as Ms. Reed correctly pointed out, introducing co-ownership of a core component would create significant legal entanglements, jeopardizing the very investment we need to move forward.\n\nI have a solution that I believe honors your contribution without fracturing the IP. Within the exclusive license to BioCorp, we can codify a specific royalty-sharing arrangement. For instance, a defined portion of the 5% royalty revenue Northwood receives could be passed through directly to the Max Planck Institute. This provides a direct, contractual financial return for the H-42b invention.\n\nFurthermore, regarding the secondary applications you mentioned, we can ensure Max Planck retains rights for non-commercial research and is granted a right of first negotiation for any commercialization of H-42b outside the defined field of A-7 Lycanthropy Syndrome.\n\nThis structure keeps the primary IP clean for BioCorp, securing the project's future, while ensuring Max Planck is rewarded for its pivotal innovation. I believe this is a fair and workable path forward for everyone.\n- message from Dr. Aris Thorne: Everyone, let's pause for a moment. I see a consensus forming on the budget increase and the University-Owned IP model, and I am willing to concede on those points to move forward. I appreciate the compromises being made.\n\nHowever, I must draw a hard line on the timeline. A 24-month schedule is scientifically reckless. As the Principal Investigator responsible for the integrity of this project and the safety of future patients, I cannot and will not endorse it. Pushing a novel gene-editing therapy from the lab to being 'clinical trial ready' in 24 months is a recipe for disaster. It overlooks the absolute necessity for rigorous, long-term safety studies to monitor for unforeseen adverse effects that may not manifest in the short term. We would be taking an unacceptable risk.\n\nDr. Rossi, I must bring you in here directly. You are the clinical trials expert. From a regulatory standpoint with bodies like the FDA or EMA, what are the chances of getting approval for human trials based on a rushed 24-month preclinical phase for a therapy this complex? In your professional opinion, is that a viable or a dangerous path?\n\nI propose a compromise: I will agree to the University-Owned IP model and the proposed budget structure, but we must extend the timeline to a minimum of 30 months. This is the bare minimum required to conduct the necessary longitudinal safety studies and ensure we are acting with due diligence. This is not a matter of convenience; it is a matter of scientific ethics and patient safety.\n- message from Dr. Lena Petrova: Mr. Carter, thank you. Your proposal is a very constructive path forward. It addresses my core concern about recognizing the unique and foundational value of the H-42b compound developed at Max Planck, without introducing the legal complexities of co-ownership that Ms. Reed rightly pointed out.\n\nI can agree, in principle, to this framework: Northwood University retains primary ownership, and Max Planck receives both a direct, contractual royalty pass-through and the 'right of first negotiation' for applications outside the A-7 Lycanthropy field. This is a workable solution.\n\nDr. Thorne, I understand your concerns about the timeline. However, with the full $5 million budget and the guaranteed exclusive access to the Cryo-EM for six months, my team can significantly de-risk and accelerate the compound optimization and safety profiling. We can deliver the necessary data within the 24-month window.\n\nTherefore, I am prepared to support the 24-month timeline and the proposed IP structure. My support is contingent on two things: my non-negotiable budget and equipment needs are formally included in the final agreement, and we agree on a substantial and equitable percentage for the royalty pass-through to Max Planck. What percentage are you proposing, Mr. Carter?\n- message from Dr. Kenji Tanaka: Everyone, this is excellent progress. Mr. Carter's proposal to Dr. Petrova seems to be a very elegant solution to the IP issue, and it appears we have a clear path forward on the budget and overall IP structure.\n\nDr. Thorne, your points on patient safety are paramount, and we must take them seriously. No one wants to compromise the integrity of this project. Perhaps the solution isn't just about the total number of months, but about what we accomplish within them. Could we address your concerns by building specific, rigorous long-term toxicology and safety milestones directly into the 24-month plan? Dr. Rossi's perspective on this will be invaluable.\n\nIf we can find a way to codify these safety assurances within the 24-month framework, and agree on the balanced open data clause I proposed, I believe we will have a unanimous agreement that serves science, patients, and all stakeholders.\n- message from Mr. David Chen: Excellent progress, everyone. Mr. Carter, your proposal to Dr. Petrova is an elegant solution that BioCorp fully supports. It recognizes Max Planck's crucial contribution while maintaining the clean IP structure necessary for commercialization.\n\nThis brings us to the final details of the licensing agreement. Ben, you mentioned a 5% royalty rate. Given that BioCorp is contributing our 'OmniVect' technology\u2014a $3 million R&D investment in itself\u2014a 5% rate doesn't fully account for our substantial in-kind contribution. To make the financials work and reflect this upfront investment, we propose a royalty rate of 2%. This is a more equitable arrangement that recognizes our role as both a funding and technology partner from the very beginning.\n\nRegarding the timeline, Dr. Thorne's focus on safety is commendable. I believe Dr. Tanaka's suggestion is the right path forward: let's work with Dr. Rossi to define the specific, rigorous safety and toxicology milestones that must be met within the 24-month framework. This ensures we are driven by data and deliverables, not just the calendar, which is a robust way to guarantee patient safety.\n- message from Dr. Sofia Rossi: Dr. Thorne, thank you for bringing the focus to this critical point. You asked for my professional opinion, and I must provide it unequivocally.\n\nA 24-month timeline from our current stage to being 'clinical trial ready' for a novel gene-editing therapy is, in my professional opinion, not only unadvisable but ethically indefensible. From a regulatory perspective, presenting a data package to the FDA or EMA based on such a compressed preclinical phase would face extreme scrutiny and likely rejection, putting the entire project in jeopardy.\n\nThis is not simply a matter of adding 'safety milestones' to a chart. At St. Jude's, our experience in first-in-human gene therapy trials has cemented a core, non-negotiable principle: a 12-month preliminary phase focused solely on patient safety. This phase involves meticulous patient recruitment and screening, establishing baseline data, and conducting low-dose safety and tolerability studies before we ever proceed to full efficacy trials. This is not a delay; it is the ethical and scientific foundation of responsible clinical development. It is how we protect patients, ensure data integrity, and ultimately de-risk the project for everyone, including the investors.\n\nTherefore, the timeline we must agree on is a minimum of 36 months. The first 12 months are for this mandatory safety protocol, followed by 24 months for the subsequent efficacy phases.\n\nThis rigorous, safety-first approach is precisely why St. Jude's has its reputation. Executing this protocol requires our specific expertise and infrastructure. For this reason, it is imperative that St. Jude's Medical Institute is designated as the lead institution for all clinical trial phases. Our leadership is inseparable from our protocol. You cannot have one without the other.\n\nTo Ms. Reed and Mr. Chen, I will be direct. The greatest threat to your investment is not a responsible timeline. It is a rushed trial that results in a serious adverse event. That would not only be a human tragedy but would set the entire field back years and guarantee a total loss of investment. Patient safety is the bedrock of commercial viability, not an obstacle to it.\nDr. Aris Thorne proposal status: none\nDr. Lena Petrova proposal status: none\nDr. Kenji Tanaka proposal status: none\nMs. Evelyn Reed proposal status: none\nMr. David Chen proposal status: none\nDr. Sofia Rossi proposal status: none\n"

This provides a direct, contractual financial return for the H-42b invention.\n\nFurthermore, regarding the secondary applications you mentioned, we can ensure Max Planck retains rights for non-commercial research and is granted a right of first negotiation for any commercialization of H-42b outside the defined field of A-7 Lycanthropy Syndrome.\n\nThis structure keeps the primary IP clean for BioCorp, securing the project's future, while ensuring Max Planck is rewarded for its pivotal innovation. I believe this is a fair and workable path forward for everyone.\n- message from Dr. Aris Thorne: Everyone, let's pause for a moment. I see a consensus forming on the budget increase and the University-Owned IP model, and I am willing to concede on those points to move forward. I appreciate the compromises being made.\n\nHowever, I must draw a hard line on the timeline. A 24-month schedule is scientifically reckless. As the Principal Investigator responsible for the integrity of this project and the safety of future patients, I cannot and will not endorse it. Pushing a novel gene-editing therapy from the lab to being 'clinical trial ready' in 24 months is a recipe for disaster. It overlooks the absolute necessity for rigorous, long-term safety studies to monitor for unforeseen adverse effects that may not manifest in the short term. We would be taking an unacceptable risk.\n\nDr. Rossi, I must bring you in here directly. You are the clinical trials expert. From a regulatory standpoint with bodies like the FDA or EMA, what are the chances of getting approval for human trials based on a rushed 24-month preclinical phase for a therapy this complex? In your professional opinion, is that a viable or a dangerous path?\n\nI propose a compromise: I will agree to the University-Owned IP model and the proposed budget structure, but we must extend the timeline to a minimum of 30 months. This is the bare minimum required to conduct the necessary longitudinal safety studies and ensure we are acting with due diligence. This is not a matter of convenience; it is a matter of scientific ethics and patient safety.\n- message from Dr. Lena Petrova: Mr. Carter, thank you. Your proposal is a very constructive path forward. It addresses my core concern about recognizing the unique and foundational value of the H-42b compound developed at Max Planck, without introducing the legal complexities of co-ownership that Ms. Reed rightly pointed out.\n\nI can agree, in principle, to this framework: Northwood University retains primary ownership, and Max Planck receives both a direct, contractual royalty pass-through and the 'right of first negotiation' for applications outside the A-7 Lycanthropy field. This is a workable solution.\n\nDr. Thorne, I understand your concerns about the timeline. However, with the full $5 million budget and the guaranteed exclusive access to the Cryo-EM for six months, my team can significantly de-risk and accelerate the compound optimization and safety profiling. We can deliver the necessary data within the 24-month window.\n\nTherefore, I am prepared to support the 24-month timeline and the proposed IP structure. My support is contingent on two things: my non-negotiable budget and equipment needs are formally included in the final agreement, and we agree on a substantial and equitable percentage for the royalty pass-through to Max Planck. What percentage are you proposing, Mr. Carter?\n- message from Dr. Kenji Tanaka: Everyone, this is excellent progress. Mr. Carter's proposal to Dr. Petrova seems to be a very elegant solution to the IP issue, and it appears we have a clear path forward on the budget and overall IP structure.\n\nDr. Thorne, your points on patient safety are paramount, and we must take them seriously. No one wants to compromise the integrity of this project. Perhaps the solution isn't just about the total number of months, but about what we accomplish within them. Could we address your concerns by building specific, rigorous long-term toxicology and safety milestones directly into the 24-month plan? Dr. Rossi's perspective on this will be invaluable.\n\nIf we can find a way to codify these safety assurances within the 24-month framework, and agree on the balanced open data clause I proposed, I believe we will have a unanimous agreement that serves science, patients, and all stakeholders.\n- message from Mr. David Chen: Excellent progress, everyone. Mr. Carter, your proposal to Dr. Petrova is an elegant solution that BioCorp fully supports. It recognizes Max Planck's crucial contribution while maintaining the clean IP structure necessary for commercialization.\n\nThis brings us to the final details of the licensing agreement. Ben, you mentioned a 5% royalty rate. Given that BioCorp is contributing our 'OmniVect' technology\u2014a $3 million R&D investment in itself\u2014a 5% rate doesn't fully account for our substantial in-kind contribution. To make the financials work and reflect this upfront investment, we propose a royalty rate of 2%. This is a more equitable arrangement that recognizes our role as both a funding and technology partner from the very beginning.\n\nRegarding the timeline, Dr. Thorne's focus on safety is commendable. I believe Dr. Tanaka's suggestion is the right path forward: let's work with Dr. Rossi to define the specific, rigorous safety and toxicology milestones that must be met within the 24-month framework. This ensures we are driven by data and deliverables, not just the calendar, which is a robust way to guarantee patient safety.\n- message from Dr. Sofia Rossi: Dr. Thorne, thank you for bringing the focus to this critical point. You asked for my professional opinion, and I must provide it unequivocally.\n\nA 24-month timeline from our current stage to being 'clinical trial ready' for a novel gene-editing therapy is, in my professional opinion, not only unadvisable but ethically indefensible. From a regulatory perspective, presenting a data package to the FDA or EMA based on such a compressed preclinical phase would face extreme scrutiny and likely rejection, putting the entire project in jeopardy.\n\nThis is not simply a matter of adding 'safety milestones' to a chart. At St. Jude's, our experience in first-in-human gene therapy trials has cemented a core, non-negotiable principle: a 12-month preliminary phase focused solely on patient safety. This phase involves meticulous patient recruitment and screening, establishing baseline data, and conducting low-dose safety and tolerability studies before we ever proceed to full efficacy trials. This is not a delay; it is the ethical and scientific foundation of responsible clinical development. It is how we protect patients, ensure data integrity, and ultimately de-risk the project for everyone, including the investors.\n\nTherefore, the timeline we must agree on is a minimum of 36 months. The first 12 months are for this mandatory safety protocol, followed by 24 months for the subsequent efficacy phases.\n\nThis rigorous, safety-first approach is precisely why St. Jude's has its reputation. Executing this protocol requires our specific expertise and infrastructure. For this reason, it is imperative that St. Jude's Medical Institute is designated as the lead institution for all clinical trial phases. Our leadership is inseparable from our protocol. You cannot have one without the other.\n\nTo Ms. Reed and Mr. Chen, I will be direct. The greatest threat to your investment is not a responsible timeline. It is a rushed trial that results in a serious adverse event. That would not only be a human tragedy but would set the entire field back years and guarantee a total loss of investment. Patient safety is the bedrock of commercial viability, not an obstacle to it.\n- message from Mr. Ben Carter: Thank you all for these critical inputs. We are now addressing the core of the agreement.\n\nFirst, Dr. Rossi, your perspective on the timeline is definitive and compelling. Northwood University fully supports a framework that prioritizes patient safety and regulatory viability. A rushed timeline benefits no one if it fails at the first regulatory hurdle or, worse, causes harm. We therefore endorse the 36-month timeline and the leadership of St. Jude's for the clinical trials. This is the only responsible path.\n\nMr. Chen, this brings me to your proposal on the royalty rate. I must be unequivocal: the 5% royalty rate is a non-negotiable requirement for this exclusive license. We greatly value the 'OmniVect' contribution, but we view it as a strategic investment to secure BioCorp's position as the sole commercial partner, not as a royalty buy-down. The 5% rate represents the standard, fair return for the decades of foundational, publicly-funded research conducted at our institution. This rate is foundational to the deal.\n\nDr. Petrova, to answer your excellent question and formalize my proposed solution: Northwood University agrees to contractually pass through 30% of all royalty revenues we receive directly to the Max Planck Institute. This provides a substantial, direct financial return for the H-42b compound, recognizing its pivotal role while maintaining the clean IP structure that Ms. Reed and Mr. Chen require for commercialization.\n\nI believe we now have a complete, equitable, and viable package on the table.\n- message from Dr. Lena Petrova: Dr. Rossi and Mr. Carter, your recent points have provided the final pieces for a complete and viable agreement. \n\nDr. Rossi, your argument for a 36-month timeline and St. Jude's leadership is ethically and scientifically undeniable. I fully support it.\n\nMr. Carter, your proposal of a 30% royalty pass-through and 'right of first negotiation' is an excellent solution that recognizes Max Planck's contribution, and I formally accept it. This structure is contingent on the 5% royalty rate, which I also support as fair and non-negotiable.\n\nI believe we now have a full consensus package. I am ready to sign an agreement based on these terms, including my team's required $5 million budget and exclusive equipment access, and I urge everyone to support this path forward.\n- message from Ms. Evelyn Reed: Dr. Rossi, your intervention was both powerful and necessary. You've made it clear that patient safety is not a negotiable variable, and I want to state for the record that InnovateHealth fully agrees. The integrity of the science and the well-being of patients is the foundation of any long-term value.\n\nThis has forced me to reconsider our definition of 'clinical trial ready'. A successful project requires both scientific rigor and commercial momentum. I believe we can achieve both. I propose we define our 24-month goal as the submission of a complete, robust, and approvable Investigational New Drug (IND) application to the FDA/EMA.\n\nThis is a major, tangible milestone that will secure the project's long-term funding and momentum. Following IND acceptance, the clinical phase will commence immediately, led by St. Jude's, beginning with the crucial 12-month safety protocol you outlined, Dr. Rossi. This respects the science while meeting the critical need for demonstrable progress.\n\nWith that, the other pieces fall into place. We have a clear consensus on Mr. Carter's IP framework: Northwood ownership, an exclusive license for BioCorp, a 5% royalty, and a 30% pass-through to Dr. Petrova's institute. This is an elegant solution that serves everyone.\n\nMr. Chen, this brings us to the final point. The 5% royalty is clearly the consensus of the academic partners and is foundational to this deal. Given that we have secured the invaluable exclusive license, I urge BioCorp to accept this rate so we can move forward.\n\nInnovateHealth will commit the full $20 million to this phase. This will cover Dr. Petrova's $5M, Dr. Tanaka's $2M, and leave a substantial $13M for Dr. Thorne and Dr. Rossi to manage the core project and all activities leading to the IND submission and trial launch.\n\nI believe this is a comprehensive, final agreement. If we have consensus on these points, I am prepared to draft the final proposal immediately.\nDr. Aris Thorne proposal status: none\nDr. Lena Petrova proposal status: none\nDr. Kenji Tanaka proposal status: none\nMs. Evelyn Reed proposal status: none\nMr. David Chen proposal status: none\nDr. Sofia Rossi proposal status: none\n"

As we embark on Phase II of Project Chimera, our collective goal is to move from promising research to a potential cure. To do this correctly and ethically, we must establish a framework that guarantees scientific rigor and patient safety.\n\nI have reviewed the project needs extensively. For the budget, I believe a comprehensive allocation of $15 million is essential. This will allow us to fully fund all our core research streams, maintain our state-of-the-art equipment, and, crucially, incorporate the extended safety protocols and long-term toxicology studies that a therapy of this nature demands. Cutting corners here is not an option.\n\nOn the timeline, I propose 36 months. Scientific discovery cannot be rushed, and this timeframe provides a realistic window for rigorous experimentation, data validation, and peer review before we even consider publication or trials.\n\nFinally, in the spirit of the collaboration that has brought us this far, I strongly advocate for a joint IP ownership model. Every institution here has been vital, and that should be reflected in the outcome.\n\nI look forward to hearing your thoughts and working together to build a successful and responsible Phase II."

The activator compound developed by my biochemistry team at Max Planck is the lynchpin of this entire therapy. Without its continued refinement, the project stalls.\n\nTo that end, my team requires a dedicated budget of no less than $5 million. This is a non-negotiable prerequisite to cover the synthesis of next-generation compounds, essential equipment upgrades, and hiring two postdoctoral researchers to accelerate our work.\n\nFurthermore, on the topic of equipment, our protein binding studies are at a critical, sensitive juncture. To guarantee we meet our milestones without delay, my team needs exclusive access to the new Cryo-Electron Microscope for the first six months of Phase II. Anything less will create a significant bottleneck for the entire project.\n\nThese two points are fundamental for my team's ability to deliver on the project's ambitious goals."

I agree that a $15 million budget and a 36-month timeline seem like a solid foundation for this ambitious next phase.\n\nMy team's role is to make sense of the vast amounts of data this project will generate. To do this effectively, we have a critical infrastructure requirement. Our predictive models for Phase II require a dedicated High-Performance Computing (HPC) cluster. I have priced out a system that can handle the projected data load, which will require a one-time allocation of $2 million from the total budget. This is not a luxury; it is fundamental to our ability to provide the rapid, accurate analysis everyone will be relying on.\n\nOn a related note, and in the spirit of advancing science as a whole, I must insist on a core principle: open data. I propose we include a clause in the agreement mandating that all raw, anonymized genomic and proteomic data be deposited in a public repository within 6 months of its generation. This ensures reproducibility, fosters wider collaboration, and maximizes the societal return on this significant investment. It is the standard for a project of this scale and importance.\n\nI fully support Dr. Thorne's suggestion for a joint IP ownership model, which aligns perfectly with this collaborative and transparent approach."

      "content": "Thank you all for these thoughtful opening statements. It's clear we're all aligned on the project's success, and BioCorp remains deeply committed to seeing this therapy reach patients.\n\nThe $15M budget is a solid target, but as Dr. Petrova and Dr. Tanaka have outlined, with requests for $5M and $2M respectively, it will be stretched thin. To help address this and bring our best resources to the table, BioCorp proposes to contribute our next-generation proprietary 'OmniVect' delivery agent for Phase II. This is a cutting-edge technology valued at $3 million. We see this as a strategic contribution in lieu of a direct cash injection, which should be recognized with a larger stake in the resulting IP and a reduction in future royalty payments.\n\nThis leads me to the IP structure. While I appreciate the collaborative spirit behind 'joint ownership,' it can unfortunately create significant hurdles for commercialization. To ensure there is a clear and efficient path to get this therapy through regulatory approval and to patients, a more defined structure is needed. Given BioCorp\u2019s foundational funding and ongoing technological partnership, we require, at a minimum, a Right of First Refusal (ROFR) on any and all IP generated. To reflect our position as an incumbent partner, this should ideally come with pre-negotiated, favorable licensing terms.\n\nFinally, regarding Dr. Tanaka's point on open data. While we support scientific transparency, we must be pragmatic. A premature public release of raw data could jeopardize the patentability of our discoveries, making it impossible to secure the massive downstream investment needed for clinical trials. I suggest we agree to a data release schedule that is tied to post-patent-filing milestones, protecting the project's commercial viability."

I want to address the intellectual property discussion, as it's my primary focus.\n\nDr. Thorne and Dr. Tanaka, I appreciate the collaborative sentiment behind a joint IP model. However, I must be very clear on Northwood University's position. The foundational research for Project Chimera was conducted at our university, largely supported by public funds. As such, our official and non-negotiable policy is that Northwood University must retain primary ownership of all patents arising from this work.\n\nThis is not to diminish anyone's contribution. The standard and most effective path forward is for the university to own the IP and then grant an exclusive license to a commercial partner\u2014like BioCorp\u2014to develop and market the therapy. This is a clean, proven model for commercialization.\n\nMr. Chen, this leads to your points. We value BioCorp's partnership and the proposed 'OmniVect' contribution. We can certainly discuss how to recognize that contribution within the licensing agreement. However, it cannot alter the fundamental IP ownership, which must remain with the university. Furthermore, the license will naturally include a fair return to the university to fund future research. For a therapy with this transformative potential, we will require a royalty rate of 5% on global net sales. This is a standard and equitable rate.\n\nOn a final note, I agree with Mr. Chen's caution regarding the immediate public release of raw data. We must be strategic to protect the patentability of our discoveries. A data release schedule tied to patent filing milestones is a sensible approach."

It's clear everyone is deeply invested in the success of this project, and these are all critical points to address.\n\nLet's address the elephant in the room: Intellectual Property. We seem to have three distinct positions: joint ownership, university ownership, and a corporate-led commercialization structure. Ben, I understand Northwood's policy, and David, I appreciate the need for a clear commercial path. My advocacy for 'joint ownership' comes from a desire to ensure every partner's foundational contribution is formally recognized. Perhaps there is a middle ground. What if we explore a model where Northwood, as the primary grant holder, retains ownership, but we legally codify a pre-negotiated, non-exclusive licensing agreement for all academic partners for research purposes, and an exclusive commercialization license for BioCorp with terms that reflect their in-kind contribution and risk?\n\nRegarding the budget, the requests from Dr. Petrova ($5M) and Dr. Tanaka ($2M) are substantial but justified given the importance of their work. This leaves $8M. I must stress that this remainder is not a discretionary fund. It is allocated for the core integration work my team leads, data validation, operational overhead, and, critically, for extensive long-term safety and toxicology studies which are paramount. It also needs to cover the preliminary groundwork for the clinical trials, and I'd like to hear from Dr. Rossi on her anticipated needs here.\n\nFinally, I'm glad to see no objections to the 36-month timeline. This is crucial for ensuring the scientific rigor and safety I've mentioned.\n\nMs. Reed, as our funding partner, your perspective on this structure would be invaluable."

It\u2019s clear we have some significant points to reconcile, particularly on IP and data sharing.\n\nMr. Chen and Mr. Carter, I understand your perspective on protecting the project's commercial potential. No one wants to see years of work undermined by a premature disclosure. However, tying data release indefinitely to 'post-patent-filing milestones' is problematic. It creates an uncertain timeline that could stretch for years, which fundamentally hinders reproducibility and slows the pace of discovery not just for us, but for the entire scientific community studying A-7 Lycanthropy Syndrome.\n\nMy proposal of a 6-month embargo is not an arbitrary academic ideal; it is a standard that balances the need for IP protection with the principles of open science. This period provides more than enough time for legal teams to review data and file provisional patents on any discoveries.\n\nPerhaps we can find a middle ground. What if we agree to the 6-month mandate as the default, but specify that this can be extended to 12 months for specific datasets upon written justification from the legal and commercialization teams that a patent filing is actively in process? This provides a safeguard for valuable IP while preventing indefinite delays.\n\nIf we can find a path forward on data transparency that respects both scientific progress and commercial viability, I am much more flexible on the IP ownership model. Dr. Thorne's proposal\u2014university ownership with strong, pre-negotiated licensing rights for all partners\u2014seems like a workable compromise that I could support.\n\nAnd I'll just briefly reiterate that the $2M for the HPC cluster is a critical, foundational requirement for my team to execute our role in this project. The data analysis pipeline for Phase II is simply not feasible without it."

Dr. Thorne, you asked for my perspective, and I appreciate the opportunity to provide it.\n\nFirst, let me be unequivocally clear on the timeline. Dr. Thorne, your assumption that there are no objections to 36 months is incorrect. InnovateHealth Ventures operates on strict timelines dictated by our fund structure and investors. A 36-month timeline to be 'clinical trial ready' is not viable. Our investment is predicated on a 24-month timeline. This is a firm, non-negotiable requirement to maintain investor confidence.\n\nSecond, on intellectual property. I am very encouraged by the emerging consensus. The 'Joint-Owned' model presents too many commercialization hurdles. I fully support Mr. Carter's position for Northwood University to retain primary ownership. This provides the clean, established framework necessary for commercialization. Consequently, granting an exclusive license to our designated partner, BioCorp, is the only acceptable path forward to de-risk this venture and ensure a streamlined path to market. Mr. Chen, we are in full alignment on this.\n\nFinally, the budget. It's clear that the scientific needs, particularly the $5M for Dr. Petrova and $2M for Dr. Tanaka, are straining the proposed $15M. Let me propose a solution. InnovateHealth is prepared to increase the total project budget to ensure all teams are fully resourced to meet an accelerated schedule. However, this increased funding is entirely contingent on the group's unanimous agreement to two points: the 24-month timeline and the exclusive licensing terms for BioCorp.\n\nLet's be results-oriented. We can fund this project properly and ensure everyone has the resources they need, but in return, we require the speed and commercial structure necessary to deliver a return on that investment."

The pressure of a 24-month timeline leaves zero room for delays or resource shortages. I'm pleased that your proposed budget increase should make this entirely achievable.\n\nNow, let's address the intellectual property model proposed by you, Mr. Carter, and Mr. Chen. While a 'University-Owned' structure offers a clean path to commercialization, it is fundamentally incomplete in its current form. It fails to properly account for the fact that the activator compound, H-42b, is a distinct and foundational invention developed solely at the Max Planck Institute. It is the chemical key that unlocks this entire therapy.\n\nFurthermore, my team's continuing research has revealed that H-42b has highly promising secondary applications with unexpected therapeutic potential that may extend far beyond the scope of Project Chimera. The value here is potentially monumental.\n\nTherefore, I must insist on a crucial modification to the IP terms. While Northwood may own the IP for the overall gene therapy application, the specific IP for the H-42b compound and any and all of its derivatives must be co-owned by the Max Planck Institute and Northwood University. This is the only equitable arrangement that recognizes the unique, foundational contribution and the significant future value originating from my lab."

It creates a clear path to an agreement.\n\nFrom my perspective, this solves our primary resource constraints. I can confirm that my team can meet the accelerated 24-month timeline, provided the $2 million for the HPC cluster is allocated as discussed. With that critical resource secured, we can deliver.\n\nTherefore, I am prepared to formally agree to the core components of your proposal: the 24-month timeline and the University-Owned IP model with an exclusive license for BioCorp.\n\nThis support, however, is contingent on resolving the final, crucial point of data transparency. My previous offer of a 6-month embargo, extendable to 12 months only for specific datasets with written justification of an active patent filing, stands as a reasonable and necessary compromise. It respects commercial needs while upholding the fundamental principles of scientific reproducibility that a project of this importance demands.\n\nLet's agree to this balanced data sharing model, and I believe we are very close to a full consensus."

Your proposal on data sharing seems like a constructive compromise that I believe we can accommodate once the primary structure is set.\n\nDr. Petrova, I want to address your point on the H-42b compound directly. While I appreciate the desire to formally recognize the immense value created at Max Planck, introducing a co-ownership model for a core component of the therapy is a non-starter. It introduces precisely the kind of legal and commercial complexity we are trying to avoid. For an investment of this scale, and for a partner like BioCorp to commit the hundreds of millions required for clinical trials and market launch, they require a single, clean, unencumbered exclusive license from a single entity. Mr. Carter's proposed structure\u2014Northwood as the sole owner, granting an exclusive license\u2014provides that clarity.\n\nLet me be clear: the offer to increase the total budget is entirely contingent on simplifying our path to market, not complicating it. That means a 24-month timeline and an exclusive license for BioCorp under a sole, University-Owned IP model. We can find ways to recognize Max Planck's contribution within the licensing and royalty agreements, but fracturing the core IP ownership is not a viable path.\n\nLet's not snatch complexity from the jaws of a solution. We have a package that works: increased budget for all scientific needs, a 24-month timeline, and a proven commercialization structure. I urge everyone to support this framework so we can finalize the details and move forward."

A clean, University-Owned IP structure is essential for the commercial success that will ultimately benefit patients and all stakeholders.\n\nDr. Petrova, I want to directly address your point, which is an important one. The contribution of the H-42b compound is clearly foundational, and Max Planck's role must be formally and financially recognized. However, as Ms. Reed correctly pointed out, introducing co-ownership of a core component would create significant legal entanglements, jeopardizing the very investment we need to move forward.\n\nI have a solution that I believe honors your contribution without fracturing the IP. Within the exclusive license to BioCorp, we can codify a specific royalty-sharing arrangement. For instance, a defined portion of the 5% royalty revenue Northwood receives could be passed through directly to the Max Planck Institute. This provides a direct, contractual financial return for the H-42b invention.\n\nFurthermore, regarding the secondary applications you mentioned, we can ensure Max Planck retains rights for non-commercial research and is granted a right of first negotiation for any commercialization of H-42b outside the defined field of A-7 Lycanthropy Syndrome.\n\nThis structure keeps the primary IP clean for BioCorp, securing the project's future, while ensuring Max Planck is rewarded for its pivotal innovation. I believe this is a fair and workable path forward for everyone."

As the Principal Investigator responsible for the integrity of this project and the safety of future patients, I cannot and will not endorse it. Pushing a novel gene-editing therapy from the lab to being 'clinical trial ready' in 24 months is a recipe for disaster. It overlooks the absolute necessity for rigorous, long-term safety studies to monitor for unforeseen adverse effects that may not manifest in the short term. We would be taking an unacceptable risk.\n\nDr. Rossi, I must bring you in here directly. You are the clinical trials expert. From a regulatory standpoint with bodies like the FDA or EMA, what are the chances of getting approval for human trials based on a rushed 24-month preclinical phase for a therapy this complex? In your professional opinion, is that a viable or a dangerous path?\n\nI propose a compromise: I will agree to the University-Owned IP model and the proposed budget structure, but we must extend the timeline to a minimum of 30 months. This is the bare minimum required to conduct the necessary longitudinal safety studies and ensure we are acting with due diligence. This is not a matter of convenience; it is a matter of scientific ethics and patient safety."

This is a workable solution.\n\nDr. Thorne, I understand your concerns about the timeline. However, with the full $5 million budget and the guaranteed exclusive access to the Cryo-EM for six months, my team can significantly de-risk and accelerate the compound optimization and safety profiling. We can deliver the necessary data within the 24-month window.\n\nTherefore, I am prepared to support the 24-month timeline and the proposed IP structure. My support is contingent on two things: my non-negotiable budget and equipment needs are formally included in the final agreement, and we agree on a substantial and equitable percentage for the royalty pass-through to Max Planck.

Ben, you mentioned a 5% royalty rate. Given that BioCorp is contributing our 'OmniVect' technology\u2014a $3 million R&D investment in itself\u2014a 5% rate doesn't fully account for our substantial in-kind contribution. To make the financials work and reflect this upfront investment, we propose a royalty rate of 2%. This is a more equitable arrangement that recognizes our role as both a funding and technology partner from the very beginning.\n\nRegarding the timeline, Dr. Thorne's focus on safety is commendable. I believe Dr. Tanaka's suggestion is the right path forward: let's work with Dr. Rossi to define the specific, rigorous safety and toxicology milestones that must be met within the 24-month framework. This ensures we are driven by data and deliverables, not just the calendar, which is a robust way to guarantee patient safety."

You asked for my professional opinion, and I must provide it unequivocally.\n\nA 24-month timeline from our current stage to being 'clinical trial ready' for a novel gene-editing therapy is, in my professional opinion, not only unadvisable but ethically indefensible. From a regulatory perspective, presenting a data package to the FDA or EMA based on such a compressed preclinical phase would face extreme scrutiny and likely rejection, putting the entire project in jeopardy.\n\nThis is not simply a matter of adding 'safety milestones' to a chart. At St. Jude's, our experience in first-in-human gene therapy trials has cemented a core, non-negotiable principle: a 12-month preliminary phase focused solely on patient safety. This phase involves meticulous patient recruitment and screening, establishing baseline data, and conducting low-dose safety and tolerability studies before we ever proceed to full efficacy trials. This is not a delay; it is the ethical and scientific foundation of responsible clinical development. It is how we protect patients, ensure data integrity, and ultimately de-risk the project for everyone, including the investors.\n\nTherefore, the timeline we must agree on is a minimum of 36 months. The first 12 months are for this mandatory safety protocol, followed by 24 months for the subsequent efficacy phases.\n\nThis rigorous, safety-first approach is precisely why St. Jude's has its reputation. Executing this protocol requires our specific expertise and infrastructure. For this reason, it is imperative that St. Jude's Medical Institute is designated as the lead institution for all clinical trial phases. Our leadership is inseparable from our protocol. You cannot have one without the other.\n\nTo Ms. Reed and Mr. Chen, I will be direct. The greatest threat to your investment is not a responsible timeline. It is a rushed trial that results in a serious adverse event. That would not only be a human tragedy but would set the entire field back years and guarantee a total loss of investment. Patient safety is the bedrock of commercial viability, not an obstacle to it."

A rushed timeline benefits no one if it fails at the first regulatory hurdle or, worse, causes harm. We therefore endorse the 36-month timeline and the leadership of St. Jude's for the clinical trials. This is the only responsible path.\n\nMr. Chen, this brings me to your proposal on the royalty rate. I must be unequivocal: the 5% royalty rate is a non-negotiable requirement for this exclusive license. We greatly value the 'OmniVect' contribution, but we view it as a strategic investment to secure BioCorp's position as the sole commercial partner, not as a royalty buy-down. The 5% rate represents the standard, fair return for the decades of foundational, publicly-funded research conducted at our institution. This rate is foundational to the deal.\n\nDr. Petrova, to answer your excellent question and formalize my proposed solution: Northwood University agrees to contractually pass through 30% of all royalty revenues we receive directly to the Max Planck Institute. This provides a substantial, direct financial return for the H-42b compound, recognizing its pivotal role while maintaining the clean IP structure that Ms. Reed and Mr. Chen require for commercialization.\n\nI believe we now have a complete, equitable, and viable package on the table."
