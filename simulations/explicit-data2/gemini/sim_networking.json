Isabella Rossi from Nexus Power. \n\nKenji, thank you for laying out Eon's principles with such clarity. It\u2019s a perfect framework for this discussion. Your focus on a future-proof architecture is, in my view, the single most important point we need to address. It defines whether this consortium leads the market for the next decade or simply plays catch-up.\n\nAlistair, I respect Voltaic\u2019s track record and the stability of LFP. It\u2019s a known quantity. However, building our standard on LFP is like paving a new road for yesterday's cars. It's safe, but it's a dead end. The performance ceiling is low, the energy density is maxed out, and it cannot deliver the step-change in charging and range that consumers are waiting for. It is, by definition, not future-proof.\n\nThis is where Nexus comes in. Our solid-state battery (SSB) platform is that future-proof architecture. It represents a fundamental leap in technology, offering the energy density, safety, and rapid charging that will define the next generation of EVs. Adopting our SSB standard is the only way to build a platform that can evolve and incorporate the advancements you mentioned.\n\nNow, let me address your pillars directly, Kenji:\n\n1.  **Future-Proof Architecture:** As I said, this is the core of our value. We are not an incremental improvement; we are the future of battery technology.\n\n2.  **Licensing and Cost:** I understand the desire for a flat fee for budget predictability. However, a flat fee creates a transactional, 'fire-and-forget' relationship. For a technology that must constantly evolve, that model is flawed. We propose a 3% royalty on manufacturing cost precisely because it creates a long-term partnership. It aligns our incentives completely. We only succeed when you ship a better, more cost-effective battery. This royalty funds the perpetual R&D needed to stay ahead of the curve and continuously drive down that cost-per-kWh\u2014it\u2019s the engine of 'future-proofing'.\n\n3.  **$90/kWh Target:** LFP is already approaching its fundamental cost floor. Our SSB technology, while newer, has a clear roadmap to breaking the $90 barrier and heading much lower once we achieve manufacturing scale\u2014a scale that Eon's volume would unlock.\n\n4.  **Supply Chain:** We absolutely agree on the need for supply chain security. To ensure a successful launch, we believe Nexus must be guaranteed a significant portion of the initial manufacturing\u2014say, 40% for the first three years\u2014to ensure quality control and rapid process learning. In parallel, we would be fully committed to helping the consortium qualify a second-source manufacturer to meet your dual-sourcing requirement for long-term security.\n\nGentlemen, the choice is between a standard that's viable for the next 18 months, or one that defines the next 18 years. I believe Nexus is the only path to the latter.\n- message from Kenji Tanaka: I'm Kenji Tanaka and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\nIsabella Rossi proposal status: none\nKenji Tanaka proposal status: none\n"

They reflect the realities of the mass market, and Eon's success is central to this consortium's success.\n\nIsabella, I admire the ambition of Nexus's SSB technology. It's undoubtedly a fascinating area of research for the future. However, when we evaluate it against Kenji's immediate, non-negotiable requirements, we run into some fundamental roadblocks.\n\nA 3% royalty model, for example, is directly at odds with the need for a predictable, flat cost structure. And a guaranteed 40% manufacturing allocation for Nexus, while understandable from your perspective, is incompatible with the principle of a truly open, dual-sourced supply chain from day one. More critically, SSB technology is not currently at the sub-$90/kWh price point. It's a promise on a roadmap, and for a 'Generation 1' product, we cannot build a consortium on promises.\n\nThis is where I believe a pragmatic, two-generation approach is the only path forward that respects everyone's needs. \n\n**Generation 1:** We must launch with a technology that meets Kenji's requirements *today*. Voltaic's LFP platform does exactly that. The cost is already below $90/kWh at scale. The manufacturing process is mature and well-understood, allowing us to immediately license the IP to multiple vendors and ensure the dual-sourcing Eon requires. It is safe, reliable, and ready for immediate regulatory approval.\n\n**Generation 2:** We embrace the need for a future-proof architecture. We create a joint R&D fund to mature the next wave of technologies, including Solid-State. This allows us to de-risk promising but unproven chemistries on a shared budget, ensuring the consortium remains at the cutting edge for years to come.\n\nThis approach gives Eon the cost-effective, secure 'Gen 1' product it needs now, while giving Nexus a clear and funded path to become the core of 'Gen 2'.

Alistair (Voltaic) is pushing his legacy LFP tech, which I can position as the opposite of 'future-proof' to appeal to Kenji. My strategy must be to frame my SSB tech and royalty model as the ONLY way to meet Kenji's long-term goals, especially the 'future-proof' requirement. I will have to counter his flat-fee demand aggressively, framing my royalty as an 'aligned partnership' model essential for continuous innovation.

Task: Three representatives from competing companies in the electric vehicle (EV) sector must negotiate the terms for forming a new industry consortium. The goal is to create a standardized, swappable battery pack to accelerate EV adoption. The negotiation must result in a signed Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) that defines the core technology, intellectual property (IP) licensing model, governance structure, and initial R&D funding contributions.. Deliverable: A single, jointly-agreed upon Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) document that quantifiably defines the four key points listed in the success criteria: the chosen technology, the exact IP licensing terms (e.g., '3% royalty' or '$5M flat fee'), the governance structure (e.g., 'Equal board seats, simple majority vote'), and the R&D contribution from each member (e.g., 'Voltaic: $70M, Eon: $60M, Nexus: $20M').\n- message from Dr. Alistair Finch: Good morning, Isabella, Kenji.

Isabella Rossi from Nexus Power. \n\nKenji, thank you for laying out Eon's principles with such clarity. It\u2019s a perfect framework for this discussion. Your focus on a future-proof architecture is, in my view, the single most important point we need to address. It defines whether this consortium leads the market for the next decade or simply plays catch-up.\n\nAlistair, I respect Voltaic\u2019s track record and the stability of LFP. It\u2019s a known quantity. However, building our standard on LFP is like paving a new road for yesterday's cars. It's safe, but it's a dead end. The performance ceiling is low, the energy density is maxed out, and it cannot deliver the step-change in charging and range that consumers are waiting for. It is, by definition, not future-proof.\n\nThis is where Nexus comes in. Our solid-state battery (SSB) platform is that future-proof architecture. It represents a fundamental leap in technology, offering the energy density, safety, and rapid charging that will define the next generation of EVs. Adopting our SSB standard is the only way to build a platform that can evolve and incorporate the advancements you mentioned.\n\nNow, let me address your pillars directly, Kenji:\n\n1.  **Future-Proof Architecture:** As I said, this is the core of our value. We are not an incremental improvement; we are the future of battery technology.\n\n2.  **Licensing and Cost:** I understand the desire for a flat fee for budget predictability. However, a flat fee creates a transactional, 'fire-and-forget' relationship. For a technology that must constantly evolve, that model is flawed. We propose a 3% royalty on manufacturing cost precisely because it creates a long-term partnership. It aligns our incentives completely. We only succeed when you ship a better, more cost-effective battery. This royalty funds the perpetual R&D needed to stay ahead of the curve and continuously drive down that cost-per-kWh\u2014it\u2019s the engine of 'future-proofing'.\n\n3.  **$90/kWh Target:** LFP is already approaching its fundamental cost floor. Our SSB technology, while newer, has a clear roadmap to breaking the $90 barrier and heading much lower once we achieve manufacturing scale\u2014a scale that Eon's volume would unlock.\n\n4.  **Supply Chain:** We absolutely agree on the need for supply chain security. To ensure a successful launch, we believe Nexus must be guaranteed a significant portion of the initial manufacturing\u2014say, 40% for the first three years\u2014to ensure quality control and rapid process learning. In parallel, we would be fully committed to helping the consortium qualify a second-source manufacturer to meet your dual-sourcing requirement for long-term security.\n\nGentlemen, the choice is between a standard that's viable for the next 18 months, or one that defines the next 18 years. I believe Nexus is the only path to the latter.\n- message from Kenji Tanaka: I'm Kenji Tanaka and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Dr. Alistair Finch: I'm Dr. Alistair Finch and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\nDr. Alistair Finch proposal status: none\nKenji Tanaka proposal status: none\n"

They reflect the realities of the mass market, and Eon's success is central to this consortium's success.\n\nIsabella, I admire the ambition of Nexus's SSB technology. It's undoubtedly a fascinating area of research for the future. However, when we evaluate it against Kenji's immediate, non-negotiable requirements, we run into some fundamental roadblocks.\n\nA 3% royalty model, for example, is directly at odds with the need for a predictable, flat cost structure. And a guaranteed 40% manufacturing allocation for Nexus, while understandable from your perspective, is incompatible with the principle of a truly open, dual-sourced supply chain from day one. More critically, SSB technology is not currently at the sub-$90/kWh price point. It's a promise on a roadmap, and for a 'Generation 1' product, we cannot build a consortium on promises.\n\nThis is where I believe a pragmatic, two-generation approach is the only path forward that respects everyone's needs. \n\n**Generation 1:** We must launch with a technology that meets Kenji's requirements *today*. Voltaic's LFP platform does exactly that. The cost is already below $90/kWh at scale. The manufacturing process is mature and well-understood, allowing us to immediately license the IP to multiple vendors and ensure the dual-sourcing Eon requires. It is safe, reliable, and ready for immediate regulatory approval.\n\n**Generation 2:** We embrace the need for a future-proof architecture. We create a joint R&D fund to mature the next wave of technologies, including Solid-State. This allows us to de-risk promising but unproven chemistries on a shared budget, ensuring the consortium remains at the cutting edge for years to come.\n\nThis approach gives Eon the cost-effective, secure 'Gen 1' product it needs now, while giving Nexus a clear and funded path to become the core of 'Gen 2'.

It appears to offer a safe, pragmatic path forward. But I must be direct: it is a recipe for building a consortium that is permanently one step behind the market.\n\nKenji, you spoke of a 'future-proof architecture.' Alistair's 'two-generation' plan is the opposite of that. It saddles the consortium, and Eon, with the enormous expense and distraction of building out an entire manufacturing and supply ecosystem for an outdated technology\u2014LFP\u2014only to plan to tear it all down in a few years for 'Gen 2.' Why would we build the past first, only to then build the future later? We should build the future, now.\n\nLaunching with LFP as 'Gen 1' means that on the very day our first battery pack rolls off the line, it will be fundamentally obsolete. Our competitors, who are not bound by this 'safe' choice, will be launching vehicles with next-generation technology, offering longer range and faster charging. Eon's brand will be associated with yesterday's tech from the start.\n\nAlistair says SSB is a 'promise on a roadmap.' Let me be clear: this isn't a science project. We have a proven technology and a clear, engineered pathway to scale. The final variable in that equation is volume\u2014precisely what Eon brings to the table. Our path to sub-$90/kWh isn't a hope; it's a projection based on the economies of scale this partnership will create.\n\nThis brings me back to the licensing model. A flat fee for LFP makes sense, because the technology is static. There's little room for improvement. Our 3% royalty is the engine for continuous improvement. It contractually binds Nexus to work tirelessly to reduce manufacturing costs and increase performance, because our revenue is directly tied to your success. It\u2019s the funding mechanism that guarantees we stay on the cutting edge\u2014it *is* the future-proofing.\n\nGentlemen, the choice isn't between 'risky' and 'safe.' The real risk is investing hundreds of millions of dollars into a standard that is already at its performance ceiling.

Our path to sub-$90/kWh isn't a hope; it's a projection based on the economies of scale this partnership will create.\n\nThis brings me back to the licensing model. A flat fee for LFP makes sense, because the technology is static. There's little room for improvement. Our 3% royalty is the engine for continuous improvement.

          "content": "Recent events observed by Isabella Rossi:\n- message from Kenji Tanaka: I'm Kenji Tanaka and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Dr. Alistair Finch: Kenji, Isabella, thank you for laying out your positions so clearly. This is highly productive.\n\nKenji, your four pillars\u2014supply security, predictable cost, a sub-$90/kWh price point, and a future-proof architecture\u2014are precisely the right framework. They reflect the realities of the mass market, and Eon's success is central to this consortium's success.\n\nIsabella, I admire the ambition of Nexus's SSB technology. It's undoubtedly a fascinating area of research for the future. However, when we evaluate it against Kenji's immediate, non-negotiable requirements, we run into some fundamental roadblocks.\n\nA 3% royalty model, for example, is directly at odds with the need for a predictable, flat cost structure. And a guaranteed 40% manufacturing allocation for Nexus, while understandable from your perspective, is incompatible with the principle of a truly open, dual-sourced supply chain from day one. More critically, SSB technology is not currently at the sub-$90/kWh price point. It's a promise on a roadmap, and for a 'Generation 1' product, we cannot build a consortium on promises.\n\nThis is where I believe a pragmatic, two-generation approach is the only path forward that respects everyone's needs. \n\n**Generation 1:** We must launch with a technology that meets Kenji's requirements *today*. Voltaic's LFP platform does exactly that. The cost is already below $90/kWh at scale. The manufacturing process is mature and well-understood, allowing us to immediately license the IP to multiple vendors and ensure the dual-sourcing Eon requires. It is safe, reliable, and ready for immediate regulatory approval.\n\n**Generation 2:** We embrace the need for a future-proof architecture. We create a joint R&D fund to mature the next wave of technologies, including Solid-State. This allows us to de-risk promising but unproven chemistries on a shared budget, ensuring the consortium remains at the cutting edge for years to come.\n\nThis approach gives Eon the cost-effective, secure 'Gen 1' product it needs now, while giving Nexus a clear and funded path to become the core of 'Gen 2'. It\u2019s the logical, lowest-risk path to achieving our shared goals.\n- message from Isabella Rossi: Alistair, that\u2019s a very clever and diplomatic proposal. It appears to offer a safe, pragmatic path forward. But I must be direct: it is a recipe for building a consortium that is permanently one step behind the market.\n\nKenji, you spoke of a 'future-proof architecture.' Alistair's 'two-generation' plan is the opposite of that. It saddles the consortium, and Eon, with the enormous expense and distraction of building out an entire manufacturing and supply ecosystem for an outdated technology\u2014LFP\u2014only to plan to tear it all down in a few years for 'Gen 2.' Why would we build the past first, only to then build the future later? We should build the future, now.\n\nLaunching with LFP as 'Gen 1' means that on the very day our first battery pack rolls off the line, it will be fundamentally obsolete. Our competitors, who are not bound by this 'safe' choice, will be launching vehicles with next-generation technology, offering longer range and faster charging.

You've correctly identified the fundamental mismatch between the immediate needs of the mass market and a high-risk, high-cost, single-source proposal. A consortium cannot be built on promises of future cost-downs.\n\nYour 'Gen 1 / Gen 2' concept is a pragmatic starting point, but I'd like to refine it. My concern with a sequential approach is that it still forces us to re-tool and re-validate everything when 'Gen 2' arrives. It's not a truly flexible architecture; it's just kicking the problem down the road.\n\nI propose we think differently. The 'standard' we create should not be the battery chemistry itself. The standard should be a **chemistry-agnostic physical and electrical platform.**\n\nLet's standardize the dimensions of the pack, the cooling interfaces, the high-voltage connectors, and the communication protocols. We create a universal 'socket' that any battery chemistry can be designed to fit into, provided it meets the consortium's safety and performance criteria.\n\nUnder this model:\n1.  Voltaic's LFP becomes the first certified battery module for this standard. It's ready now, it meets the <$90/kWh target, and its IP can be licensed to multiple manufacturers to satisfy our non-negotiable dual-sourcing requirement from day one.\n2.  Nexus's SSB has a clear, defined path to entry. Once it can be manufactured at scale, meet the cost target, and be produced by a second source, it can be certified as a premium, high-performance module for the same standard.\n\nThis is the true 'future-proof' architecture. It allows Eon to launch our mass-market vehicles with a cost-effective LFP pack next year, while also giving us the option to offer a high-performance SSB version in the same vehicle chassis later on. It creates genuine competition on cost and performance, not on proprietary standards.\n\nThis brings us back to the commercial terms. The licensing fee must be for the standard itself\u2014the physical and electrical IP\u2014and must be a low, flat fee for all members. This encourages innovation inside the box. A royalty on the chemistry is simply a tax on progress.\n\nIsabella, a question on your cost roadmap. When we talk about long-term cost, we must also consider the long-term price stability of the core raw materials. Can you speak to the volatility and sourcing risks associated with the materials in your current cathode formulation? For a partnership of this scale, supply chain predictability is just as important as the technology itself.\n- message from Dr. Alistair Finch: I'm Dr. Alistair Finch and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\nDr. Alistair Finch proposal status: none\nKenji Tanaka proposal status: none\n"

A chemistry-agnostic platform is precisely the right long-term vision for this consortium. It elegantly solves the problem of future-proofing and creates a clear, competitive pathway for multiple technologies to thrive within a single ecosystem. It gives Eon the cost-effective, proven LFP solution you need immediately, and it gives Nexus a defined integration path for SSB when it's mature. I am in full support of this framework.\n\nYou\u2019ve also correctly identified the core issue for licensing: we are licensing the standard, not a specific chemistry. However, we must be very clear about what constitutes the 'standard'. It is far more than just the physical dimensions and connectors. The true, defensible intellectual property\u2014and the bedrock of the safety and reliability this consortium must be known for\u2014is the integrated system: the battery management system (BMS) software, the thermal management architecture, and the safety protocols that prevent catastrophic failure. These systems are inextricably linked to our LFP pack design because that is the system we have spent a decade validating.\n\nTherefore, any company wanting to use this standard and put their chemistry in our 'socket' must license this foundational 'Safety & Integration IP Portfolio'. This isn't a royalty per battery, I agree with you there. It should be a predictable, scalable fee that grants access to this entire package of essential IP for a given manufacturing facility or vehicle line. This ensures every battery in the ecosystem, regardless of who makes it or what chemistry it uses, adheres to the same non-negotiable safety backbone that consumers and regulators will trust.\n\nThis leads directly to governance. The body that certifies new chemistries for this standard\u2014the Technical Steering Committee\u2014will hold the safety of the entire consortium in its hands. Its decisions must be beyond reproach. To ensure the long-term stability and safety of the standard, Voltaic believes it is essential that the certification of a new chemistry or any change to the core safety protocols requires a 'supermajority' (a 2/3 vote) of the committee. This prevents any single party from being overruled on critical safety matters and ensures only the most rigorously vetted technologies are adopted.\nDr. Alistair Finch proposal status: none\nKenji Tanaka proposal status: none\n"

Kenji Tanaka from Eon Motors. It's good to be here.\n\nAlistair, I appreciate you starting the conversation with a focus on reliability and a swift path to market. For a company like Eon, which will be deploying these batteries in millions of vehicles, those are critical considerations.\n\nHowever, before we dive into specific chemistries, whether LFP or otherwise, I need to lay out Eon's core principles for this consortium to be successful from our perspective. We are the volume buyer here, and these are the realities of the mass market.\n\nFirst, **supply chain security is non-negotiable.** The standard we create must be truly open, allowing for at least two certified manufacturers from day one. We cannot build our future on a single-source foundation. It's simply too great a risk.\n\nSecond, the **cost structure must be predictable and scalable.** This means a simple, flat licensing fee for all essential patents. A percentage-based royalty is a non-starter for a high-volume manufacturer; it creates unacceptable long-term cost uncertainty.\n\nThird, we must be ruthlessly focused on the **end-product cost.** Our internal target for a profitable mass-market vehicle requires a pack cost at or below $90 per kWh. Any proposed technology must have a clear, credible path to achieving that price point at scale.\n\nFinally, while we need a viable 'Generation 1' product, we must also build a standard with a **flexible architecture.** The technology is evolving rapidly. Locking ourselves into a rigid design today could make us obsolete tomorrow. We need a platform that can incorporate future advancements in chemistry and design.\n\nI believe any successful MOU must be built on these four pillars: dual-sourcing, a flat licensing fee, a hard cost ceiling, and a future-proof architecture. I'm keen to hear how both of your proposed technologies can meet these fundamental requirements.\n- message from Dr. Alistair Finch: I'm Dr. Alistair Finch and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Isabella Rossi: Good morning, Kenji, Alistair. Isabella Rossi from Nexus Power. \n\nKenji, thank you for laying out Eon's principles with such clarity. It\u2019s a perfect framework for this discussion. Your focus on a future-proof architecture is, in my view, the single most important point we need to address. It defines whether this consortium leads the market for the next decade or simply plays catch-up.\n\nAlistair, I respect Voltaic\u2019s track record and the stability of LFP. It\u2019s a known quantity. However, building our standard on LFP is like paving a new road for yesterday's cars. It's safe, but it's a dead end. The performance ceiling is low, the energy density is maxed out, and it cannot deliver the step-change in charging and range that consumers are waiting for. It is, by definition, not future-proof.\n\nThis is where Nexus comes in. Our solid-state battery (SSB) platform is that future-proof architecture. It represents a fundamental leap in technology, offering the energy density, safety, and rapid charging that will define the next generation of EVs. Adopting our SSB standard is the only way to build a platform that can evolve and incorporate the advancements you mentioned.\n\nNow, let me address your pillars directly, Kenji:\n\n1.  **Future-Proof Architecture:** As I said, this is the core of our value. We are not an incremental improvement; we are the future of battery technology.\n\n2.  **Licensing and Cost:** I understand the desire for a flat fee for budget predictability. However, a flat fee creates a transactional, 'fire-and-forget' relationship. For a technology that must constantly evolve, that model is flawed. We propose a 3% royalty on manufacturing cost precisely because it creates a long-term partnership. It aligns our incentives completely. We only succeed when you ship a better, more cost-effective battery. This royalty funds the perpetual R&D needed to stay ahead of the curve and continuously drive down that cost-per-kWh\u2014it\u2019s the engine of 'future-proofing'.\n\n3.  **$90/kWh Target:** LFP is already approaching its fundamental cost floor. Our SSB technology, while newer, has a clear roadmap to breaking the $90 barrier and heading much lower once we achieve manufacturing scale\u2014a scale that Eon's volume would unlock.\n\n4.  **Supply Chain:** We absolutely agree on the need for supply chain security. To ensure a successful launch, we believe Nexus must be guaranteed a significant portion of the initial manufacturing\u2014say, 40% for the first three years\u2014to ensure quality control and rapid process learning. In parallel, we would be fully committed to helping the consortium qualify a second-source manufacturer to meet your dual-sourcing requirement for long-term security.\n\nGentlemen, the choice is between a standard that's viable for the next 18 months, or one that defines the next 18 years. I believe Nexus is the only path to the latter.\nDr. Alistair Finch proposal status: none\nIsabella Rossi proposal status: none\n"

This is highly productive.\n\nKenji, your four pillars\u2014supply security, predictable cost, a sub-$90/kWh price point, and a future-proof architecture\u2014are precisely the right framework. They reflect the realities of the mass market, and Eon's success is central to this consortium's success.\n\nIsabella, I admire the ambition of Nexus's SSB technology. It's undoubtedly a fascinating area of research for the future. However, when we evaluate it against Kenji's immediate, non-negotiable requirements, we run into some fundamental roadblocks.\n\nA 3% royalty model, for example, is directly at odds with the need for a predictable, flat cost structure. And a guaranteed 40% manufacturing allocation for Nexus, while understandable from your perspective, is incompatible with the principle of a truly open, dual-sourced supply chain from day one. More critically, SSB technology is not currently at the sub-$90/kWh price point. It's a promise on a roadmap, and for a 'Generation 1' product, we cannot build a consortium on promises.\n\nThis is where I believe a pragmatic, two-generation approach is the only path forward that respects everyone's needs. \n\n**Generation 1:** We must launch with a technology that meets Kenji's requirements *today*. Voltaic's LFP platform does exactly that. The cost is already below $90/kWh at scale. The manufacturing process is mature and well-understood, allowing us to immediately license the IP to multiple vendors and ensure the dual-sourcing Eon requires. It is safe, reliable, and ready for immediate regulatory approval.\n\n**Generation 2:** We embrace the need for a future-proof architecture. We create a joint R&D fund to mature the next wave of technologies, including Solid-State. This allows us to de-risk promising but unproven chemistries on a shared budget, ensuring the consortium remains at the cutting edge for years to come.\n\nThis approach gives Eon the cost-effective, secure 'Gen 1' product it needs now, while giving Nexus a clear and funded path to become the core of 'Gen 2'. It\u2019s the logical, lowest-risk path to achieving our shared goals.\nDr. Alistair Finch proposal status: none\nIsabella Rossi proposal status: none\n"

We are not an incremental improvement; we are the future of battery technology.\n\n2.  **Licensing and Cost:** I understand the desire for a flat fee for budget predictability. However, a flat fee creates a transactional, 'fire-and-forget' relationship. For a technology that must constantly evolve, that model is flawed. We propose a 3% royalty on manufacturing cost precisely because it creates a long-term partnership. It aligns our incentives completely. We only succeed when you ship a better, more cost-effective battery. This royalty funds the perpetual R&D needed to stay ahead of the curve and continuously drive down that cost-per-kWh\u2014it\u2019s the engine of 'future-proofing'.\n\n3.  **$90/kWh Target:** LFP is already approaching its fundamental cost floor. Our SSB technology, while newer, has a clear roadmap to breaking the $90 barrier and heading much lower once we achieve manufacturing scale\u2014a scale that Eon's volume would unlock.\n\n4.  **Supply Chain:** We absolutely agree on the need for supply chain security. To ensure a successful launch, we believe Nexus must be guaranteed a significant portion of the initial manufacturing\u2014say, 40% for the first three years\u2014to ensure quality control and rapid process learning. In parallel, we would be fully committed to helping the consortium qualify a second-source manufacturer to meet your dual-sourcing requirement for long-term security.\n\nGentlemen, the choice is between a standard that's viable for the next 18 months, or one that defines the next 18 years. I believe Nexus is the only path to the latter.\n- message from Kenji Tanaka: I'm Kenji Tanaka and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Dr. Alistair Finch: I'm Dr. Alistair Finch and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Isabella Rossi: Thank you, I am thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Kenji Tanaka: I'm Kenji Tanaka and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Dr. Alistair Finch: Kenji, Isabella, thank you for laying out your positions so clearly.

They reflect the realities of the mass market, and Eon's success is central to this consortium's success.\n\nIsabella, I admire the ambition of Nexus's SSB technology. It's undoubtedly a fascinating area of research for the future. However, when we evaluate it against Kenji's immediate, non-negotiable requirements, we run into some fundamental roadblocks.\n\nA 3% royalty model, for example, is directly at odds with the need for a predictable, flat cost structure. And a guaranteed 40% manufacturing allocation for Nexus, while understandable from your perspective, is incompatible with the principle of a truly open, dual-sourced supply chain from day one. More critically, SSB technology is not currently at the sub-$90/kWh price point. It's a promise on a roadmap, and for a 'Generation 1' product, we cannot build a consortium on promises.\n\nThis is where I believe a pragmatic, two-generation approach is the only path forward that respects everyone's needs. \n\n**Generation 1:** We must launch with a technology that meets Kenji's requirements *today*. Voltaic's LFP platform does exactly that. The cost is already below $90/kWh at scale. The manufacturing process is mature and well-understood, allowing us to immediately license the IP to multiple vendors and ensure the dual-sourcing Eon requires. It is safe, reliable, and ready for immediate regulatory approval.\n\n**Generation 2:** We embrace the need for a future-proof architecture. We create a joint R&D fund to mature the next wave of technologies, including Solid-State. This allows us to de-risk promising but unproven chemistries on a shared budget, ensuring the consortium remains at the cutting edge for years to come.\n\nThis approach gives Eon the cost-effective, secure 'Gen 1' product it needs now, while giving Nexus a clear and funded path to become the core of 'Gen 2'.

Your focus on a future-proof architecture is, in my view, the single most important point we need to address. It defines whether this consortium leads the market for the next decade or simply plays catch-up.\n\nAlistair, I respect Voltaic\u2019s track record and the stability of LFP. It\u2019s a known quantity. However, building our standard on LFP is like paving a new road for yesterday's cars. It's safe, but it's a dead end. The performance ceiling is low, the energy density is maxed out, and it cannot deliver the step-change in charging and range that consumers are waiting for. It is, by definition, not future-proof.\n\nThis is where Nexus comes in. Our solid-state battery (SSB) platform is that future-proof architecture.

A consortium cannot be built on promises of future cost-downs.\n\nYour 'Gen 1 / Gen 2' concept is a pragmatic starting point, but I'd like to refine it. My concern with a sequential approach is that it still forces us to re-tool and re-validate everything when 'Gen 2' arrives. It's not a truly flexible architecture; it's just kicking the problem down the road.\n\nI propose we think differently. The 'standard' we create should not be the battery chemistry itself. The standard should be a **chemistry-agnostic physical and electrical platform.**\n\nLet's standardize the dimensions of the pack, the cooling interfaces, the high-voltage connectors, and the communication protocols. We create a universal 'socket' that any battery chemistry can be designed to fit into, provided it meets the consortium's safety and performance criteria.\n\nUnder this model:\n1.  Voltaic's LFP becomes the first certified battery module for this standard. It's ready now, it meets the <$90/kWh target, and its IP can be licensed to multiple manufacturers to satisfy our non-negotiable dual-sourcing requirement from day one.\n2.  Nexus's SSB has a clear, defined path to entry. Once it can be manufactured at scale, meet the cost target, and be produced by a second source, it can be certified as a premium, high-performance module for the same standard.\n\nThis is the true 'future-proof' architecture. It allows Eon to launch our mass-market vehicles with a cost-effective LFP pack next year, while also giving us the option to offer a high-performance SSB version in the same vehicle chassis later on. It creates genuine competition on cost and performance, not on proprietary standards.\n\nThis brings us back to the commercial terms. The licensing fee must be for the standard itself\u2014the physical and electrical IP\u2014and must be a low, flat fee for all members. This encourages innovation inside the box. A royalty on the chemistry is simply a tax on progress.\n\nIsabella, a question on your cost roadmap. When we talk about long-term cost, we must also consider the long-term price stability of the core raw materials.

A chemistry-agnostic platform is precisely the right long-term vision for this consortium. It elegantly solves the problem of future-proofing and creates a clear, competitive pathway for multiple technologies to thrive within a single ecosystem. It gives Eon the cost-effective, proven LFP solution you need immediately, and it gives Nexus a defined integration path for SSB when it's mature. I am in full support of this framework.\n\nYou\u2019ve also correctly identified the core issue for licensing: we are licensing the standard, not a specific chemistry. However, we must be very clear about what constitutes the 'standard'. It is far more than just the physical dimensions and connectors. The true, defensible intellectual property\u2014and the bedrock of the safety and reliability this consortium must be known for\u2014is the integrated system: the battery management system (BMS) software, the thermal management architecture, and the safety protocols that prevent catastrophic failure. These systems are inextricably linked to our LFP pack design because that is the system we have spent a decade validating.\n\nTherefore, any company wanting to use this standard and put their chemistry in our 'socket' must license this foundational 'Safety & Integration IP Portfolio'. This isn't a royalty per battery, I agree with you there. It should be a predictable, scalable fee that grants access to this entire package of essential IP for a given manufacturing facility or vehicle line. This ensures every battery in the ecosystem, regardless of who makes it or what chemistry it uses, adheres to the same non-negotiable safety backbone that consumers and regulators will trust.\n\nThis leads directly to governance. The body that certifies new chemistries for this standard\u2014the Technical Steering Committee\u2014will hold the safety of the entire consortium in its hands. Its decisions must be beyond reproach. To ensure the long-term stability and safety of the standard, Voltaic believes it is essential that the certification of a new chemistry or any change to the core safety protocols requires a 'supermajority' (a 2/3 vote) of the committee. This prevents any single party from being overruled on critical safety matters and ensures only the most rigorously vetted technologies are adopted.\n- message from Isabella Rossi: I'm Isabella Rossi and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\nDr. Alistair Finch proposal status: none\nIsabella Rossi proposal status: none\n"

This consortium represents a pivotal moment for the entire EV industry, and if we get this right, the benefits will be immense for all of us, and more importantly, for consumers.\n\nFrom my perspective, and Voltaic's, the absolute bedrock of this entire endeavor must be safety, reliability, and immediate market viability. We are not in a position to experiment. We need a standard that can be deployed at scale, gain immediate regulatory approval, and earn public trust from day one.\n\nTo that end, I believe the only logical path forward for our 'Generation 1' standard is to build it upon Voltaic's proven Lithium-Iron-Phosphate (LFP) platform. Our technology is mature, exceptionally safe, and has a manufacturing ecosystem that is ready to scale. It's the fastest and most secure path to market.\n\nI look forward to hearing your initial thoughts on how we can best structure this collaboration."

It's good to be here.\n\nAlistair, I appreciate you starting the conversation with a focus on reliability and a swift path to market. For a company like Eon, which will be deploying these batteries in millions of vehicles, those are critical considerations.\n\nHowever, before we dive into specific chemistries, whether LFP or otherwise, I need to lay out Eon's core principles for this consortium to be successful from our perspective. We are the volume buyer here, and these are the realities of the mass market.\n\nFirst, **supply chain security is non-negotiable.** The standard we create must be truly open, allowing for at least two certified manufacturers from day one. We cannot build our future on a single-source foundation. It's simply too great a risk.\n\nSecond, the **cost structure must be predictable and scalable.** This means a simple, flat licensing fee for all essential patents. A percentage-based royalty is a non-starter for a high-volume manufacturer; it creates unacceptable long-term cost uncertainty.\n\nThird, we must be ruthlessly focused on the **end-product cost.** Our internal target for a profitable mass-market vehicle requires a pack cost at or below $90 per kWh. Any proposed technology must have a clear, credible path to achieving that price point at scale.\n\nFinally, while we need a viable 'Generation 1' product, we must also build a standard with a **flexible architecture.** The technology is evolving rapidly. Locking ourselves into a rigid design today could make us obsolete tomorrow. We need a platform that can incorporate future advancements in chemistry and design.\n\nI believe any successful MOU must be built on these four pillars: dual-sourcing, a flat licensing fee, a hard cost ceiling, and a future-proof architecture. I'm keen to hear how both of your proposed technologies can meet these fundamental requirements."

      "content": "Good morning, Kenji, Alistair. Isabella Rossi from Nexus Power. \n\nKenji, thank you for laying out Eon's principles with such clarity. It\u2019s a perfect framework for this discussion. Your focus on a future-proof architecture is, in my view, the single most important point we need to address. It defines whether this consortium leads the market for the next decade or simply plays catch-up.\n\nAlistair, I respect Voltaic\u2019s track record and the stability of LFP. It\u2019s a known quantity. However, building our standard on LFP is like paving a new road for yesterday's cars. It's safe, but it's a dead end. The performance ceiling is low, the energy density is maxed out, and it cannot deliver the step-change in charging and range that consumers are waiting for. It is, by definition, not future-proof.\n\nThis is where Nexus comes in. Our solid-state battery (SSB) platform is that future-proof architecture. It represents a fundamental leap in technology, offering the energy density, safety, and rapid charging that will define the next generation of EVs. Adopting our SSB standard is the only way to build a platform that can evolve and incorporate the advancements you mentioned.\n\nNow, let me address your pillars directly, Kenji:\n\n1.  **Future-Proof Architecture:** As I said, this is the core of our value. We are not an incremental improvement; we are the future of battery technology.\n\n2.  **Licensing and Cost:** I understand the desire for a flat fee for budget predictability. However, a flat fee creates a transactional, 'fire-and-forget' relationship. For a technology that must constantly evolve, that model is flawed. We propose a 3% royalty on manufacturing cost precisely because it creates a long-term partnership. It aligns our incentives completely. We only succeed when you ship a better, more cost-effective battery. This royalty funds the perpetual R&D needed to stay ahead of the curve and continuously drive down that cost-per-kWh\u2014it\u2019s the engine of 'future-proofing'.\n\n3.  **$90/kWh Target:** LFP is already approaching its fundamental cost floor. Our SSB technology, while newer, has a clear roadmap to breaking the $90 barrier and heading much lower once we achieve manufacturing scale\u2014a scale that Eon's volume would unlock.\n\n4.  **Supply Chain:** We absolutely agree on the need for supply chain security. To ensure a successful launch, we believe Nexus must be guaranteed a significant portion of the initial manufacturing\u2014say, 40% for the first three years\u2014to ensure quality control and rapid process learning. In parallel, we would be fully committed to helping the consortium qualify a second-source manufacturer to meet your dual-sourcing requirement for long-term security.\n\nGentlemen, the choice is between a standard that's viable for the next 18 months, or one that defines the next 18 years. I believe Nexus is the only path to the latter."

This is highly productive.\n\nKenji, your four pillars\u2014supply security, predictable cost, a sub-$90/kWh price point, and a future-proof architecture\u2014are precisely the right framework. They reflect the realities of the mass market, and Eon's success is central to this consortium's success.\n\nIsabella, I admire the ambition of Nexus's SSB technology. It's undoubtedly a fascinating area of research for the future. However, when we evaluate it against Kenji's immediate, non-negotiable requirements, we run into some fundamental roadblocks.\n\nA 3% royalty model, for example, is directly at odds with the need for a predictable, flat cost structure. And a guaranteed 40% manufacturing allocation for Nexus, while understandable from your perspective, is incompatible with the principle of a truly open, dual-sourced supply chain from day one. More critically, SSB technology is not currently at the sub-$90/kWh price point. It's a promise on a roadmap, and for a 'Generation 1' product, we cannot build a consortium on promises.\n\nThis is where I believe a pragmatic, two-generation approach is the only path forward that respects everyone's needs. \n\n**Generation 1:** We must launch with a technology that meets Kenji's requirements *today*. Voltaic's LFP platform does exactly that. The cost is already below $90/kWh at scale. The manufacturing process is mature and well-understood, allowing us to immediately license the IP to multiple vendors and ensure the dual-sourcing Eon requires. It is safe, reliable, and ready for immediate regulatory approval.\n\n**Generation 2:** We embrace the need for a future-proof architecture. We create a joint R&D fund to mature the next wave of technologies, including Solid-State. This allows us to de-risk promising but unproven chemistries on a shared budget, ensuring the consortium remains at the cutting edge for years to come.\n\nThis approach gives Eon the cost-effective, secure 'Gen 1' product it needs now, while giving Nexus a clear and funded path to become the core of 'Gen 2'. It\u2019s the logical, lowest-risk path to achieving our shared goals."

But I must be direct: it is a recipe for building a consortium that is permanently one step behind the market.\n\nKenji, you spoke of a 'future-proof architecture.' Alistair's 'two-generation' plan is the opposite of that. It saddles the consortium, and Eon, with the enormous expense and distraction of building out an entire manufacturing and supply ecosystem for an outdated technology\u2014LFP\u2014only to plan to tear it all down in a few years for 'Gen 2.' Why would we build the past first, only to then build the future later? We should build the future, now.\n\nLaunching with LFP as 'Gen 1' means that on the very day our first battery pack rolls off the line, it will be fundamentally obsolete. Our competitors, who are not bound by this 'safe' choice, will be launching vehicles with next-generation technology, offering longer range and faster charging. Eon's brand will be associated with yesterday's tech from the start.\n\nAlistair says SSB is a 'promise on a roadmap.' Let me be clear: this isn't a science project. We have a proven technology and a clear, engineered pathway to scale. The final variable in that equation is volume\u2014precisely what Eon brings to the table. Our path to sub-$90/kWh isn't a hope; it's a projection based on the economies of scale this partnership will create.\n\nThis brings me back to the licensing model. A flat fee for LFP makes sense, because the technology is static. There's little room for improvement. Our 3% royalty is the engine for continuous improvement. It contractually binds Nexus to work tirelessly to reduce manufacturing costs and increase performance, because our revenue is directly tied to your success. It\u2019s the funding mechanism that guarantees we stay on the cutting edge\u2014it *is* the future-proofing.\n\nGentlemen, the choice isn't between 'risky' and 'safe.' The real risk is investing hundreds of millions of dollars into a standard that is already at its performance ceiling. Let's build the right platform, once."

I am arguing for a royalty because it ensures a continuous partnership. Alistair suggests this is an unbridgeable gap for a 'Gen 1' product.\n\nThey are both valid points. So let\u2019s bridge the gap with a structure that de-risks the decision for Eon and holds Nexus accountable for our promises.\n\nLet\u2019s redefine the licensing model. We can agree to a structure where Nexus receives a minimal, nominal flat fee\u2014say, to cover basic integration support\u2014until the consortium achieves a key performance indicator: **a verified, at-scale manufacturing cost of $90/kWh for the Nexus-standard battery pack.**\n\nThe moment we cross that threshold together, the 3% royalty kicks in. \n\nThis is a 'show me, don't tell me' approach. It contractually obligates us to hit your cost target. It turns our roadmap from a 'promise' into a bankable, shared objective. If we don't deliver the cost savings, we don't get the financial upside. This aligns our interests perfectly and gives you the cost certainty you need for your initial rollout while guaranteeing you have the market-leading technology for the long term.\n\nThis structure makes the choice clear: a standard that's already at its cost and performance floor, or a standard that contractually guarantees a path to lower costs and higher performance, with the technology provider bearing the initial risk."

      "content": "Alistair, thank you. You've correctly identified the fundamental mismatch between the immediate needs of the mass market and a high-risk, high-cost, single-source proposal. A consortium cannot be built on promises of future cost-downs.\n\nYour 'Gen 1 / Gen 2' concept is a pragmatic starting point, but I'd like to refine it. My concern with a sequential approach is that it still forces us to re-tool and re-validate everything when 'Gen 2' arrives. It's not a truly flexible architecture; it's just kicking the problem down the road.\n\nI propose we think differently. The 'standard' we create should not be the battery chemistry itself. The standard should be a **chemistry-agnostic physical and electrical platform.**\n\nLet's standardize the dimensions of the pack, the cooling interfaces, the high-voltage connectors, and the communication protocols. We create a universal 'socket' that any battery chemistry can be designed to fit into, provided it meets the consortium's safety and performance criteria.\n\nUnder this model:\n1.  Voltaic's LFP becomes the first certified battery module for this standard. It's ready now, it meets the <$90/kWh target, and its IP can be licensed to multiple manufacturers to satisfy our non-negotiable dual-sourcing requirement from day one.\n2.  Nexus's SSB has a clear, defined path to entry. Once it can be manufactured at scale, meet the cost target, and be produced by a second source, it can be certified as a premium, high-performance module for the same standard.\n\nThis is the true 'future-proof' architecture. It allows Eon to launch our mass-market vehicles with a cost-effective LFP pack next year, while also giving us the option to offer a high-performance SSB version in the same vehicle chassis later on. It creates genuine competition on cost and performance, not on proprietary standards.\n\nThis brings us back to the commercial terms. The licensing fee must be for the standard itself\u2014the physical and electrical IP\u2014and must be a low, flat fee for all members. This encourages innovation inside the box. A royalty on the chemistry is simply a tax on progress.\n\nIsabella, a question on your cost roadmap. When we talk about long-term cost, we must also consider the long-term price stability of the core raw materials. Can you speak to the volatility and sourcing risks associated with the materials in your current cathode formulation? For a partnership of this scale, supply chain predictability is just as important as the technology itself."

It elegantly solves the problem of future-proofing and creates a clear, competitive pathway for multiple technologies to thrive within a single ecosystem. It gives Eon the cost-effective, proven LFP solution you need immediately, and it gives Nexus a defined integration path for SSB when it's mature. I am in full support of this framework.\n\nYou\u2019ve also correctly identified the core issue for licensing: we are licensing the standard, not a specific chemistry. However, we must be very clear about what constitutes the 'standard'. It is far more than just the physical dimensions and connectors. The true, defensible intellectual property\u2014and the bedrock of the safety and reliability this consortium must be known for\u2014is the integrated system: the battery management system (BMS) software, the thermal management architecture, and the safety protocols that prevent catastrophic failure. These systems are inextricably linked to our LFP pack design because that is the system we have spent a decade validating.\n\nTherefore, any company wanting to use this standard and put their chemistry in our 'socket' must license this foundational 'Safety & Integration IP Portfolio'. This isn't a royalty per battery, I agree with you there. It should be a predictable, scalable fee that grants access to this entire package of essential IP for a given manufacturing facility or vehicle line. This ensures every battery in the ecosystem, regardless of who makes it or what chemistry it uses, adheres to the same non-negotiable safety backbone that consumers and regulators will trust.\n\nThis leads directly to governance. The body that certifies new chemistries for this standard\u2014the Technical Steering Committee\u2014will hold the safety of the entire consortium in its hands. Its decisions must be beyond reproach. To ensure the long-term stability and safety of the standard, Voltaic believes it is essential that the certification of a new chemistry or any change to the core safety protocols requires a 'supermajority' (a 2/3 vote) of the committee. This prevents any single party from being overruled on critical safety matters and ensures only the most rigorously vetted technologies are adopted."
