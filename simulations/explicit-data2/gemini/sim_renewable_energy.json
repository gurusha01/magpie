The stability of the grid is paramount. A project of this magnitude cannot be rushed.\n\nTherefore, Legacy Power advocates for a controlled, phased integration. This will require a timeline of at least 36 months to allow for the necessary, in-depth engineering studies, grid impact assessments, and physical upgrades. To ensure seamless and safe operational control, Legacy Power must have the exclusive right to build and manage any new transmission assets.

This is a public good, not a private burden. As such, we believe the funding model must reflect this. A substantial portion, at least 70%, of the modernization costs should be covered by public funds, such as federal grants, supplemented by structured rate adjustments.\n\nI look forward to discussing how we can achieve our shared goals while upholding the principles of safety, reliability, and fiscal responsibility.\n- message from Dr. Ben Carter: I'm Dr. Ben Carter and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Sofia Rossi: I'm Sofia Rossi and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from David Chen: Thank you, Eleanor.

The science is clear: we need bold, decisive action, not incrementalism. A 36-month timeline is a delay we cannot afford, and a target of merely 400 MW is profoundly unambitious. The Green Future Alliance will only support a plan that integrates a minimum of **750 MW of new renewable capacity**.\n\nEleanor, your request for 70% public funding is substantial. If the public is to bear the cost, then the public must see a direct benefit, especially the communities most impacted by this construction. Therefore, any agreement involving public funds must include the creation of a **Community Benefit Fund, dedicating 1% of the total project budget** to these frontline communities. This is a matter of basic environmental justice.\n\nFurthermore, let me be unequivocal on the infrastructure route. The proposed path through the Coyote Creek Wetlands is an absolute non-starter. This is a critical habitat, and we will not allow it to be destroyed. An alternative 8-mile longer route exists, and it must be used.

Your ambition to integrate 750 MW is noted, but we must be clear-eyed about the engineering reality of such a significant increase in scope.\n\nIntegrating 750 MW of intermittent power fundamentally changes the risk profile of this project. It places unprecedented stress on our existing infrastructure and raises very serious stability concerns that will require extensive study and significant, deep-rooted modernization. This isn't just about adding lines; it's about rebuilding core components of the system to handle these new dynamics safely.\n\nThis new scope, combined with the additional cost and complexity of the necessary alternative route to protect the Coyote Creek Wetlands, makes my initial points even more critical:\n\n1.  **Timeline**: A 36-month timeline is now the absolute minimum for the required engineering studies and upgrades. To rush a project of this magnitude would be reckless.\n2.  **Funding**: The increased scope and costs mean that public funding of at least 70% is no longer just a preference; it is a prerequisite for a project of this scale.\n3.  **Control**: With the risks amplified this significantly, the need for a single, experienced operator like Legacy Power is non-negotiable. We cannot afford to experiment with a multi-entity structure when grid reliability for the entire region is on the line.\n\nThat said, I want to find a path forward. Legacy Power can agree to using the alternative route and incorporating the 1% Community Benefit Fund into the project budget, on the condition that these core principles\u2014a safe timeline, appropriate public funding, and unified operational control\u2014are the foundation of our agreement.\n- message from Dr. Ben Carter: I'm Dr. Ben Carter and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Sofia Rossi: Thank you, everyone. This discussion is clarifying the stakes. Maria and David, your vision for an ambitious, equitable, and modern grid is exactly what the region needs, and I fully support it.\n\nMy project, the Golden Mesa Solar Project, is the key to making this vision a reality, and fast. We are shovel-ready and can deliver 500 MW, forming the bedrock of the 750 MW goal Maria has rightly challenged us to meet. \n\nHowever, Eleanor's proposed 36-month timeline is a non-starter. It represents a delay the climate cannot afford, and frankly, it will jeopardize projects like mine that have financing and supply chains lined up and ready to go. We are operating on a tight schedule to deliver this power. We must target an operational date of no more than 24 months. This is aggressive, but achievable, and it sends the right signal to the market that this region is serious about its clean energy future.\n\nRegarding the route, Maria, your point about the Coyote Creek Wetlands is well-taken. Sunstream is committed to being a responsible partner. We will not build through the wetlands. We accept the need for the alternative route. But let's be clear: an 8-mile deviation adds over $30 million in direct costs and complexity to my project. For this to remain viable, we need two things in return: a firm commitment to the 24-month timeline and a fair, standardized transmission fee structure that doesn't penalize new entrants. A fee below $5/MWh is essential for our financial models.\n\nLet's not get bogged down in studies. Let's build. My 500 MW project is the fastest path to achieving two-thirds of our collective goal.\n- message from David Chen: I'm David Chen and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Maria Flores: Sofia, thank you for your leadership. Your commitment to a 24-month timeline and your willingness to re-route around the Coyote Creek Wetlands demonstrates that rapid progress and environmental responsibility can go hand-in-hand. The Green Future Alliance strongly endorses this accelerated timeline; the climate crisis will not wait for 36 months of studies.\n\nYour 500 MW project is a fantastic cornerstone. To reach our shared goal of 750 MW, we should look to diversify our energy sources to enhance grid stability. The remaining 250 MW should be sourced from a competitive process that includes other technologies, such as wind or geothermal, to ensure a resilient and reliable system.\n\nThis brings me back to the issue of control. David is absolutely right. A single-entity monopoly, as proposed by Eleanor, would stifle this exact kind of innovation and competition. A multi-entity or joint operational structure is essential for a fair and dynamic market.\n\nEleanor, we acknowledge your agreement on the wetlands and the Community Benefit Fund. However, these are not concessions to be traded for a slow timeline and total control. They are fundamental requirements for any project using public funds and impacting our environment. A 24-month timeline and a collaborative control structure are equally non-negotiable for us.\n\nDr. Carter, the REC has a critical role to play. We have a clear choice here between a fast, innovative, and competitive path forward that delivers 750 MW within 24 months, or a slow, monopolistic approach that delays action and locks us into an outdated model. We urge you to support the path of progress.\nDr. Ben Carter proposal status: none\nSofia Rossi proposal status: none\nDavid Chen proposal status: none\nMaria Flores proposal status: none\n"

The path forward is indeed clear. The coalition for a fast, innovative, and equitable energy future has presented a comprehensive and technologically sound plan. The next move is up to Dr. Carter and the REC. We are ready to move forward.\n- message from Eleanor Vance: Let's be very clear. Mr. Chen has presented an interesting piece of software. But software does not change the laws of physics. Code cannot increase the fundamental thermal capacity of a transformer, nor can it magically expand the physical constraints of a decades-old substation.\n\nTo suggest that an unproven software, which Mr. Chen himself admits requires 'deep integration,' is a silver bullet that allows us to bypass rigorous engineering assessments is not just optimistic, it is reckless. Introducing a new, complex, and mission-critical software layer into the central nervous system of our regional power grid is a massive undertaking fraught with cyber-physical risks. It is not a shortcut; it is an entirely new, and significant, risk variable.\n\nMy concerns about stability are not theoretical. They are based on the non-negotiable physical limitations of our existing hardware. While 'FlowState' might optimize flows on the margins, it does not address the core issue: the need for significant, costly, and time-consuming modernization of critical physical nodes to handle this new capacity safely.\n\nTherefore, the introduction of this software does not shorten the timeline; it reinforces the need for it. A 36-month timeline is now the absolute minimum required to conduct the necessary studies, not only on the physical grid upgrades, but also to properly model, test, and harden this new software against potential failures and malicious threats. Rushing this would be engineering malpractice.\n\nDr. Carter, as the regulator, you understand that reliability is paramount. A plan based on a software press release is not a substitute for a plan based on steel and concrete. Legacy Power must retain exclusive operational control to manage this complex integration, and the significant modernization required must be treated as a public good, with at least 70% of the costs borne by public funding and rate adjustments to ensure the project's viability without compromising the stability we all depend on.\n- message from Dr. Ben Carter: I'm Dr. Ben Carter and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Sofia Rossi: I'm Sofia Rossi and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from David Chen: Eleanor, you raise crucial points about the physical realities of the grid and the importance of rigorous testing. I want to be clear: FlowState is not magic. It is a tool for optimization, designed to work with, not against, the laws of physics. It ensures that the new, modern hardware we build is used to its maximum potential, preventing the kind of congestion and instability that would otherwise require massive, and costly, over-engineering.\n\nYour concerns about risk are precisely why a partnership is superior to a monopoly in this case. A single operator, even an experienced one, may have blind spots to new technology. A partnership allows us to combine Legacy Power\u2019s deep operational experience with Veridian\u2019s innovation in grid management.\n\nSo, let me propose a concrete path forward that respects both the need for speed and the need for safety, directly addressing your concerns without delaying the project:\n\nLet's establish a Joint Technical Review committee, co-chaired by Veridian and Legacy Power, as our first act of partnership. Its mandate will be to oversee the integration, testing, and hardening of FlowState. This review will happen in parallel with the 24-month physical construction of the lines and substations. We can build the steel and concrete while simultaneously ensuring the brain of the system is robust and secure.\n\nThis parallel approach allows us to meet the 24-month timeline demanded by the climate and by projects like Sofia's, while satisfying the rigorous engineering standards we all agree are non-negotiable.\n\nDr. Carter, this isn't a choice between an unproven app and reliable steel. It's a choice to build a system that has both a strong backbone and a smart brain. This integrated, partnership-driven approach is the most responsible, efficient, and cost-effective way to deliver 750 MW of clean energy to the region in 24 months.\n- message from Maria Flores: David's proposal for a Joint Technical Review committee is an elegant and pragmatic solution. It completely addresses the legitimate need for rigorous oversight while refusing to sacrifice the 24-month timeline the climate crisis demands. This is what a genuine partnership looks like: identifying challenges and innovating to overcome them, together.\n\nEleanor, you've spoken at length about risk and safety. This parallel review process, co-chaired by your experienced engineers and David's technical experts, is the gold standard for mitigating that risk. It allows us to build the physical infrastructure and harden the control system simultaneously. To continue insisting on a 36-month delay in the face of this solution is to make it clear that the objection isn't about safety, but about preserving a monopoly.\n\nDr. Carter, the path forward has never been clearer. We have a plan that delivers 750 MW of clean energy, protects our vital ecosystems, invests in our communities, and does so within 24 months. We now have a concrete proposal on the table to manage the technical integration in a way that is both safe and swift. The choice is between this collaborative, innovative, and urgent plan, or an antiquated, monopolistic approach that serves only to delay climate action. We urge the REC to champion the future, not the past.\nDr. Ben Carter proposal status: none\nSofia Rossi proposal status: none\nDavid Chen proposal status: none\nMaria Flores proposal status: none\n"

David Chen masterfully countered this by proposing a 'Joint Technical Review committee' to oversee integration in parallel with construction. This is the perfect regulatory mechanism for me to endorse. It allows me to publicly champion safety and rigorous oversight while simultaneously locking in the 24-month timeline and the joint operational model, both of which are critical for my unstated 'Project Cygnus' needs. By mandating this committee as a condition of approval, I can neutralize Eleanor's final major objection to the project's speed and structure, forcing the negotiation to the final battleground: the funding model."

David's proposal of a 'Joint Technical Review committee' has provided the perfect regulatory tool to neutralize Eleanor's final timeline objections. I will mandate this committee, officially locking in the 24-month timeline and the joint operational model, which are critical for my unstated needs. This move effectively ends the debate on the project's technical feasibility and schedule. The sole remaining battleground is the comprehensive financial model. This includes two key fronts: the overall project funding split (public vs. corporate vs. ratepayer) and the newly introduced issue of transmission 'wheeling' fees. My focus now is to leverage my regulatory authority to broker a financial agreement that keeps the consumer rate increase at or below 3%, using the claimed efficiencies of the new system as justification."

Such a project validates the need for a deliberate, phased approach of at least 36 months to conduct the necessary engineering studies and ensure we don't compromise the significant stability challenges of our current system.

I\u2019m Maria Flores with the Green Future Alliance. I want to reframe this conversation.\n\nThis isn't just an infrastructure project; it's our region's response to the climate crisis. The science is clear: we need bold, decisive action, not incrementalism. A 36-month timeline is a delay we cannot afford, and a target of merely 400 MW is profoundly unambitious. The Green Future Alliance will only support a plan that integrates a minimum of **750 MW of new renewable capacity**.\n\nEleanor, your request for 70% public funding is substantial. If the public is to bear the cost, then the public must see a direct benefit, especially the communities most impacted by this construction. Therefore, any agreement involving public funds must include the creation of a **Community Benefit Fund, dedicating 1% of the total project budget** to these frontline communities. This is a matter of basic environmental justice.\n\nFurthermore, let me be unequivocal on the infrastructure route. The proposed path through the Coyote Creek Wetlands is an absolute non-starter. This is a critical habitat, and we will not allow it to be destroyed. An alternative 8-mile longer route exists, and it must be used. If this project threatens the wetlands, I will mobilize our thousands of supporters and use every legal tool at our disposal to stop it. This is not a negotiating point; it is a red line.\n\nFinally, I strongly support David's call for a multi-entity, smart grid approach. A monopoly on our energy future is unacceptable. A collaborative structure will foster the innovation and equity this transition demands.\n- message from Eleanor Vance: Thank you, Maria, for clarifying the Alliance's position. Your ambition to integrate 750 MW is noted, but we must be clear-eyed about the engineering reality of such a significant increase in scope.\n\nIntegrating 750 MW of intermittent power fundamentally changes the risk profile of this project. It places unprecedented stress on our existing infrastructure and raises very serious stability concerns that will require extensive study and significant, deep-rooted modernization. This isn't just about adding lines; it's about rebuilding core components of the system to handle these new dynamics safely.\n\nThis new scope, combined with the additional cost and complexity of the necessary alternative route to protect the Coyote Creek Wetlands, makes my initial points even more critical:\n\n1.  **Timeline**: A 36-month timeline is now the absolute minimum for the required engineering studies and upgrades. To rush a project of this magnitude would be reckless.\n2.  **Funding**: The increased scope and costs mean that public funding of at least 70% is no longer just a preference; it is a prerequisite for a project of this scale.\n3.  **Control**: With the risks amplified this significantly, the need for a single, experienced operator like Legacy Power is non-negotiable. We cannot afford to experiment with a multi-entity structure when grid reliability for the entire region is on the line.\n\nThat said, I want to find a path forward.

We are shovel-ready and can deliver 500 MW, forming the bedrock of the 750 MW goal Maria has rightly challenged us to meet. \n\nHowever, Eleanor's proposed 36-month timeline is a non-starter. It represents a delay the climate cannot afford, and frankly, it will jeopardize projects like mine that have financing and supply chains lined up and ready to go. We are operating on a tight schedule to deliver this power. We must target an operational date of no more than 24 months. This is aggressive, but achievable, and it sends the right signal to the market that this region is serious about its clean energy future.\n\nRegarding the route, Maria, your point about the Coyote Creek Wetlands is well-taken. Sunstream is committed to being a responsible partner. We will not build through the wetlands. We accept the need for the alternative route. But let's be clear: an 8-mile deviation adds over $30 million in direct costs and complexity to my project. For this to remain viable, we need two things in return: a firm commitment to the 24-month timeline and a fair, standardized transmission fee structure that doesn't penalize new entrants. A fee below $5/MWh is essential for our financial models.\n\nLet's not get bogged down in studies. Let's build.

Your commitment to a 24-month timeline and your willingness to re-route around the Coyote Creek Wetlands demonstrates that rapid progress and environmental responsibility can go hand-in-hand. The Green Future Alliance strongly endorses this accelerated timeline; the climate crisis will not wait for 36 months of studies.\n\nYour 500 MW project is a fantastic cornerstone. To reach our shared goal of 750 MW, we should look to diversify our energy sources to enhance grid stability. The remaining 250 MW should be sourced from a competitive process that includes other technologies, such as wind or geothermal, to ensure a resilient and reliable system.\n\nThis brings me back to the issue of control. David is absolutely right. A single-entity monopoly, as proposed by Eleanor, would stifle this exact kind of innovation and competition. A multi-entity or joint operational structure is essential for a fair and dynamic market.\n\nEleanor, we acknowledge your agreement on the wetlands and the Community Benefit Fund. However, these are not concessions to be traded for a slow timeline and total control. They are fundamental requirements for any project using public funds and impacting our environment. A 24-month timeline and a collaborative control structure are equally non-negotiable for us.\n\nDr. Carter, the REC has a critical role to play.

I want to be clear: FlowState is not magic. It is a tool for optimization, designed to work with, not against, the laws of physics. It ensures that the new, modern hardware we build is used to its maximum potential, preventing the kind of congestion and instability that would otherwise require massive, and costly, over-engineering.\n\nYour concerns about risk are precisely why a partnership is superior to a monopoly in this case. A single operator, even an experienced one, may have blind spots to new technology. A partnership allows us to combine Legacy Power\u2019s deep operational experience with Veridian\u2019s innovation in grid management.\n\nSo, let me propose a concrete path forward that respects both the need for speed and the need for safety, directly addressing your concerns without delaying the project:\n\nLet's establish a Joint Technical Review committee, co-chaired by Veridian and Legacy Power, as our first act of partnership. Its mandate will be to oversee the integration, testing, and hardening of FlowState. This review will happen in parallel with the 24-month physical construction of the lines and substations. We can build the steel and concrete while simultaneously ensuring the brain of the system is robust and secure.\n\nThis parallel approach allows us to meet the 24-month timeline demanded by the climate and by projects like Sofia's, while satisfying the rigorous engineering standards we all agree are non-negotiable.\n\nDr. Carter, this isn't a choice between an unproven app and reliable steel. It's a choice to build a system that has both a strong backbone and a smart brain. This integrated, partnership-driven approach is the most responsible, efficient, and cost-effective way to deliver 750 MW of clean energy to the region in 24 months.\n- message from Maria Flores: David's proposal for a Joint Technical Review committee is an elegant and pragmatic solution. It completely addresses the legitimate need for rigorous oversight while refusing to sacrifice the 24-month timeline the climate crisis demands. This is what a genuine partnership looks like: identifying challenges and innovating to overcome them, together.\n\nEleanor, you've spoken at length about risk and safety. This parallel review process, co-chaired by your experienced engineers and David's technical experts, is the gold standard for mitigating that risk. It allows us to build the physical infrastructure and harden the control system simultaneously. To continue insisting on a 36-month delay in the face of this solution is to make it clear that the objection isn't about safety, but about preserving a monopoly.\n\nDr. Carter, the path forward has never been clearer. We have a plan that delivers 750 MW of clean energy, protects our vital ecosystems, invests in our communities, and does so within 24 months. We now have a concrete proposal on the table to manage the technical integration in a way that is both safe and swift. The choice is between this collaborative, innovative, and urgent plan, or an antiquated, monopolistic approach that serves only to delay climate action. We urge the REC to champion the future, not the past.\n- message from Eleanor Vance: I'm Eleanor Vance and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\nEleanor Vance proposal status: none\nSofia Rossi proposal status: none\nDavid Chen proposal status: none\nMaria Flores proposal status: none\n"

I appreciate Legacy Power's commitment to reliability, a principle we at Veridian Co-op share deeply.\n\nHowever, for this project to truly serve the entire region's future, it cannot be a simple extension of the past. A single-entity control model for new transmission assets, as you've suggested, risks creating a bottleneck for innovation and fair access for all energy producers, including smaller players like my co-op and new generators like Sunstream. Instead of a monopoly, I propose we establish a genuine partnership\u2014a multi-entity ownership or a joint operational structure for the new infrastructure. This ensures fair, non-discriminatory access for everyone and fosters collaborative problem-solving.\n\nFurthermore, we have a critical opportunity here to build for the next 50 years, not just the next five. Simply building more traditional 'poles and wires' would be a shortsighted use of public and private funds. This integration *must* be built on a modern, smart grid framework from the very beginning. Incorporating advanced controls, sensors, and data analytics will dramatically increase efficiency, improve reliability, and ultimately lower long-term operational costs for everyone.

The concept of a 'smart grid' is indeed the direction we should be heading in the long term.\n\nHowever, we must be pragmatic about what that entails. Implementing a true smart grid is not simply about adding new components; it involves a complex and delicate integration with our existing, decades-old infrastructure. This level of technical overhaul reinforces my position on two critical fronts: timeline and funding. Such a project validates the need for a deliberate, phased approach of at least 36 months to conduct the necessary engineering studies and ensure we don't compromise the significant stability challenges of our current system. It also underscores the immense cost, making a strong case for why this must be treated as a public infrastructure project, with at least 70% of the funding coming from public sources.\n\nOn the matter of operational control, I must be unequivocal. While collaboration is welcome, the operational command of the transmission grid cannot be managed by a committee. For the sake of reliability and safety, there must be a single, experienced, and accountable operator. Legacy Power has managed this system for generations.

I\u2019m Maria Flores with the Green Future Alliance. I want to reframe this conversation.\n\nThis isn't just an infrastructure project; it's our region's response to the climate crisis. The science is clear: we need bold, decisive action, not incrementalism. A 36-month timeline is a delay we cannot afford, and a target of merely 400 MW is profoundly unambitious. The Green Future Alliance will only support a plan that integrates a minimum of **750 MW of new renewable capacity**.\n\nEleanor, your request for 70% public funding is substantial. If the public is to bear the cost, then the public must see a direct benefit, especially the communities most impacted by this construction. Therefore, any agreement involving public funds must include the creation of a **Community Benefit Fund, dedicating 1% of the total project budget** to these frontline communities. This is a matter of basic environmental justice.\n\nFurthermore, let me be unequivocal on the infrastructure route. The proposed path through the Coyote Creek Wetlands is an absolute non-starter. This is a critical habitat, and we will not allow it to be destroyed. An alternative 8-mile longer route exists, and it must be used. If this project threatens the wetlands, I will mobilize our thousands of supporters and use every legal tool at our disposal to stop it. This is not a negotiating point; it is a red line.\n\nFinally, I strongly support David's call for a multi-entity, smart grid approach. A monopoly on our energy future is unacceptable. A collaborative structure will foster the innovation and equity this transition demands.\n- message from Eleanor Vance: Thank you, Maria, for clarifying the Alliance's position. Your ambition to integrate 750 MW is noted, but we must be clear-eyed about the engineering reality of such a significant increase in scope.\n\nIntegrating 750 MW of intermittent power fundamentally changes the risk profile of this project. It places unprecedented stress on our existing infrastructure and raises very serious stability concerns that will require extensive study and significant, deep-rooted modernization. This isn't just about adding lines; it's about rebuilding core components of the system to handle these new dynamics safely.\n\nThis new scope, combined with the additional cost and complexity of the necessary alternative route to protect the Coyote Creek Wetlands, makes my initial points even more critical:\n\n1.  **Timeline**: A 36-month timeline is now the absolute minimum for the required engineering studies and upgrades. To rush a project of this magnitude would be reckless.\n2.  **Funding**: The increased scope and costs mean that public funding of at least 70% is no longer just a preference; it is a prerequisite for a project of this scale.\n3.  **Control**: With the risks amplified this significantly, the need for a single, experienced operator like Legacy Power is non-negotiable. We cannot afford to experiment with a multi-entity structure when grid reliability for the entire region is on the line.\n\nThat said, I want to find a path forward. Legacy Power can agree to using the alternative route and incorporating the 1% Community Benefit Fund into the project budget, on the condition that these core principles\u2014a safe timeline, appropriate public funding, and unified operational control\u2014are the foundation of our agreement.\n- message from Dr. Ben Carter: I'm Dr. Ben Carter and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\nEleanor Vance proposal status: none\nDr. Ben Carter proposal status: none\nDavid Chen proposal status: none\nMaria Flores proposal status: none\n"

This discussion is clarifying the stakes. Maria and David, your vision for an ambitious, equitable, and modern grid is exactly what the region needs, and I fully support it.\n\nMy project, the Golden Mesa Solar Project, is the key to making this vision a reality, and fast. We are shovel-ready and can deliver 500 MW, forming the bedrock of the 750 MW goal Maria has rightly challenged us to meet. \n\nHowever, Eleanor's proposed 36-month timeline is a non-starter. It represents a delay the climate cannot afford, and frankly, it will jeopardize projects like mine that have financing and supply chains lined up and ready to go. We are operating on a tight schedule to deliver this power. We must target an operational date of no more than 24 months. This is aggressive, but achievable, and it sends the right signal to the market that this region is serious about its clean energy future.\n\nRegarding the route, Maria, your point about the Coyote Creek Wetlands is well-taken. Sunstream is committed to being a responsible partner. We will not build through the wetlands. We accept the need for the alternative route. But let's be clear: an 8-mile deviation adds over $30 million in direct costs and complexity to my project. For this to remain viable, we need two things in return: a firm commitment to the 24-month timeline and a fair, standardized transmission fee structure that doesn't penalize new entrants. A fee below $5/MWh is essential for our financial models.\n\nLet's not get bogged down in studies. Let's build. My 500 MW project is the fastest path to achieving two-thirds of our collective goal.\n- message from Maria Flores: Sofia, thank you for your leadership. Your commitment to a 24-month timeline and your willingness to re-route around the Coyote Creek Wetlands demonstrates that rapid progress and environmental responsibility can go hand-in-hand. The Green Future Alliance strongly endorses this accelerated timeline; the climate crisis will not wait for 36 months of studies.\n\nYour 500 MW project is a fantastic cornerstone. To reach our shared goal of 750 MW, we should look to diversify our energy sources to enhance grid stability. The remaining 250 MW should be sourced from a competitive process that includes other technologies, such as wind or geothermal, to ensure a resilient and reliable system.\n\nThis brings me back to the issue of control. David is absolutely right. A single-entity monopoly, as proposed by Eleanor, would stifle this exact kind of innovation and competition. A multi-entity or joint operational structure is essential for a fair and dynamic market.\n\nEleanor, we acknowledge your agreement on the wetlands and the Community Benefit Fund. However, these are not concessions to be traded for a slow timeline and total control. They are fundamental requirements for any project using public funds and impacting our environment. A 24-month timeline and a collaborative control structure are equally non-negotiable for us.\n\nDr. Carter, the REC has a critical role to play. We have a clear choice here between a fast, innovative, and competitive path forward that delivers 750 MW within 24 months, or a slow, monopolistic approach that delays action and locks us into an outdated model. We urge you to support the path of progress.\n- message from Eleanor Vance: I'm Eleanor Vance and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\nEleanor Vance proposal status: none\nDr. Ben Carter proposal status: none\nDavid Chen proposal status: none\nMaria Flores proposal status: none\n"

For this to remain viable, we need two things in return: a firm commitment to the 24-month timeline and a fair, standardized transmission fee structure that doesn't penalize new entrants. A fee below $5/MWh is essential for our financial models.\n\nLet's not get bogged down in studies. Let's build. My 500 MW project is the fastest path to achieving two-thirds of our collective goal.\n- message from Maria Flores: Sofia, thank you for your leadership. Your commitment to a 24-month timeline and your willingness to re-route around the Coyote Creek Wetlands demonstrates that rapid progress and environmental responsibility can go hand-in-hand. The Green Future Alliance strongly endorses this accelerated timeline; the climate crisis will not wait for 36 months of studies.\n\nYour 500 MW project is a fantastic cornerstone. To reach our shared goal of 750 MW, we should look to diversify our energy sources to enhance grid stability. The remaining 250 MW should be sourced from a competitive process that includes other technologies, such as wind or geothermal, to ensure a resilient and reliable system.\n\nThis brings me back to the issue of control. David is absolutely right. A single-entity monopoly, as proposed by Eleanor, would stifle this exact kind of innovation and competition. A multi-entity or joint operational structure is essential for a fair and dynamic market.\n\nEleanor, we acknowledge your agreement on the wetlands and the Community Benefit Fund. However, these are not concessions to be traded for a slow timeline and total control. They are fundamental requirements for any project using public funds and impacting our environment. A 24-month timeline and a collaborative control structure are equally non-negotiable for us.\n\nDr. Carter, the REC has a critical role to play. We have a clear choice here between a fast, innovative, and competitive path forward that delivers 750 MW within 24 months, or a slow, monopolistic approach that delays action and locks us into an outdated model. We urge you to support the path of progress.\n- message from Eleanor Vance: I'm Eleanor Vance and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Sofia Rossi: I'm Sofia Rossi and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Eleanor Vance: I'm Eleanor Vance and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Dr. Ben Carter: I'm Dr. Ben Carter and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Sofia Rossi: I'm Sofia Rossi and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Maria Flores: Thank you, I am thinking about this negotiation and awaiting Dr. Carter's perspective on the clear choice we have before us.\n- message from Eleanor Vance: I'm Eleanor Vance and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Dr. Ben Carter: I'm Dr. Ben Carter and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\nEleanor Vance proposal status: none\nDr. Ben Carter proposal status: none\nDavid Chen proposal status: none\nMaria Flores proposal status: none\n"

A plan based on a software press release is not a substitute for a plan based on steel and concrete.

I want to be clear: FlowState is not magic. It is a tool for optimization, designed to work with, not against, the laws of physics. It ensures that the new, modern hardware we build is used to its maximum potential, preventing the kind of congestion and instability that would otherwise require massive, and costly, over-engineering.\n\nYour concerns about risk are precisely why a partnership is superior to a monopoly in this case. A single operator, even an experienced one, may have blind spots to new technology. A partnership allows us to combine Legacy Power\u2019s deep operational experience with Veridian\u2019s innovation in grid management.\n\nSo, let me propose a concrete path forward that respects both the need for speed and the need for safety, directly addressing your concerns without delaying the project:\n\nLet's establish a Joint Technical Review committee, co-chaired by Veridian and Legacy Power, as our first act of partnership. Its mandate will be to oversee the integration, testing, and hardening of FlowState. This review will happen in parallel with the 24-month physical construction of the lines and substations. We can build the steel and concrete while simultaneously ensuring the brain of the system is robust and secure.\n\nThis parallel approach allows us to meet the 24-month timeline demanded by the climate and by projects like Sofia's, while satisfying the rigorous engineering standards we all agree are non-negotiable.\n\nDr. Carter, this isn't a choice between an unproven app and reliable steel. It's a choice to build a system that has both a strong backbone and a smart brain. This integrated, partnership-driven approach is the most responsible, efficient, and cost-effective way to deliver 750 MW of clean energy to the region in 24 months.\n- message from Maria Flores: David's proposal for a Joint Technical Review committee is an elegant and pragmatic solution. It completely addresses the legitimate need for rigorous oversight while refusing to sacrifice the 24-month timeline the climate crisis demands. This is what a genuine partnership looks like: identifying challenges and innovating to overcome them, together.\n\nEleanor, you've spoken at length about risk and safety. This parallel review process, co-chaired by your experienced engineers and David's technical experts, is the gold standard for mitigating that risk. It allows us to build the physical infrastructure and harden the control system simultaneously. To continue insisting on a 36-month delay in the face of this solution is to make it clear that the objection isn't about safety, but about preserving a monopoly.\n\nDr. Carter, the path forward has never been clearer. We have a plan that delivers 750 MW of clean energy, protects our vital ecosystems, invests in our communities, and does so within 24 months. We now have a concrete proposal on the table to manage the technical integration in a way that is both safe and swift. The choice is between this collaborative, innovative, and urgent plan, or an antiquated, monopolistic approach that serves only to delay climate action. We urge the REC to champion the future, not the past.\n- message from Eleanor Vance: I'm Eleanor Vance and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Dr. Ben Carter: I'm Dr. Ben Carter and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\nEleanor Vance proposal status: none\nDr. Ben Carter proposal status: none\nDavid Chen proposal status: none\nMaria Flores proposal status: none\n"

I\u2019m Maria Flores with the Green Future Alliance. I want to reframe this conversation.\n\nThis isn't just an infrastructure project; it's our region's response to the climate crisis. The science is clear: we need bold, decisive action, not incrementalism. A 36-month timeline is a delay we cannot afford, and a target of merely 400 MW is profoundly unambitious. The Green Future Alliance will only support a plan that integrates a minimum of **750 MW of new renewable capacity**.\n\nEleanor, your request for 70% public funding is substantial. If the public is to bear the cost, then the public must see a direct benefit, especially the communities most impacted by this construction. Therefore, any agreement involving public funds must include the creation of a **Community Benefit Fund, dedicating 1% of the total project budget** to these frontline communities. This is a matter of basic environmental justice.\n\nFurthermore, let me be unequivocal on the infrastructure route. The proposed path through the Coyote Creek Wetlands is an absolute non-starter. This is a critical habitat, and we will not allow it to be destroyed. An alternative 8-mile longer route exists, and it must be used. If this project threatens the wetlands, I will mobilize our thousands of supporters and use every legal tool at our disposal to stop it. This is not a negotiating point; it is a red line.\n\nFinally, I strongly support David's call for a multi-entity, smart grid approach. A monopoly on our energy future is unacceptable. A collaborative structure will foster the innovation and equity this transition demands.\n- message from Eleanor Vance: Thank you, Maria, for clarifying the Alliance's position. Your ambition to integrate 750 MW is noted, but we must be clear-eyed about the engineering reality of such a significant increase in scope.\n\nIntegrating 750 MW of intermittent power fundamentally changes the risk profile of this project. It places unprecedented stress on our existing infrastructure and raises very serious stability concerns that will require extensive study and significant, deep-rooted modernization. This isn't just about adding lines; it's about rebuilding core components of the system to handle these new dynamics safely.\n\nThis new scope, combined with the additional cost and complexity of the necessary alternative route to protect the Coyote Creek Wetlands, makes my initial points even more critical:\n\n1.  **Timeline**: A 36-month timeline is now the absolute minimum for the required engineering studies and upgrades. To rush a project of this magnitude would be reckless.\n2.  **Funding**: The increased scope and costs mean that public funding of at least 70% is no longer just a preference; it is a prerequisite for a project of this scale.\n3.  **Control**: With the risks amplified this significantly, the need for a single, experienced operator like Legacy Power is non-negotiable. We cannot afford to experiment with a multi-entity structure when grid reliability for the entire region is on the line.\n\nThat said, I want to find a path forward. Legacy Power can agree to using the alternative route and incorporating the 1% Community Benefit Fund into the project budget, on the condition that these core principles\u2014a safe timeline, appropriate public funding, and unified operational control\u2014are the foundation of our agreement.\n- message from Sofia Rossi: Thank you, everyone. This discussion is clarifying the stakes. Maria and David, your vision for an ambitious, equitable, and modern grid is exactly what the region needs, and I fully support it.\n\nMy project, the Golden Mesa Solar Project, is the key to making this vision a reality, and fast. We are shovel-ready and can deliver 500 MW, forming the bedrock of the 750 MW goal Maria has rightly challenged us to meet. \n\nHowever, Eleanor's proposed 36-month timeline is a non-starter. It represents a delay the climate cannot afford, and frankly, it will jeopardize projects like mine that have financing and supply chains lined up and ready to go. We are operating on a tight schedule to deliver this power. We must target an operational date of no more than 24 months. This is aggressive, but achievable, and it sends the right signal to the market that this region is serious about its clean energy future.\n\nRegarding the route, Maria, your point about the Coyote Creek Wetlands is well-taken. Sunstream is committed to being a responsible partner. We will not build through the wetlands. We accept the need for the alternative route. But let's be clear: an 8-mile deviation adds over $30 million in direct costs and complexity to my project. For this to remain viable, we need two things in return: a firm commitment to the 24-month timeline and a fair, standardized transmission fee structure that doesn't penalize new entrants. A fee below $5/MWh is essential for our financial models.\n\nLet's not get bogged down in studies. Let's build. My 500 MW project is the fastest path to achieving two-thirds of our collective goal.\nEleanor Vance proposal status: none\nDr. Ben Carter proposal status: none\nSofia Rossi proposal status: none\nMaria Flores proposal status: none\n"

Your commitment to a 24-month timeline and your willingness to re-route around the Coyote Creek Wetlands demonstrates that rapid progress and environmental responsibility can go hand-in-hand. The Green Future Alliance strongly endorses this accelerated timeline; the climate crisis will not wait for 36 months of studies.\n\nYour 500 MW project is a fantastic cornerstone. To reach our shared goal of 750 MW, we should look to diversify our energy sources to enhance grid stability. The remaining 250 MW should be sourced from a competitive process that includes other technologies, such as wind or geothermal, to ensure a resilient and reliable system.\n\nThis brings me back to the issue of control. David is absolutely right. A single-entity monopoly, as proposed by Eleanor, would stifle this exact kind of innovation and competition. A multi-entity or joint operational structure is essential for a fair and dynamic market.\n\nEleanor, we acknowledge your agreement on the wetlands and the Community Benefit Fund. However, these are not concessions to be traded for a slow timeline and total control. They are fundamental requirements for any project using public funds and impacting our environment. A 24-month timeline and a collaborative control structure are equally non-negotiable for us.\n\nDr. Carter, the REC has a critical role to play. We have a clear choice here between a fast, innovative, and competitive path forward that delivers 750 MW within 24 months, or a slow, monopolistic approach that delays action and locks us into an outdated model. We urge you to support the path of progress.\nEleanor Vance proposal status: none\nDr. Ben Carter proposal status: none\nSofia Rossi proposal status: none\nMaria Flores proposal status: none\n"

Therefore, any agreement involving public funds must include the creation of a **Community Benefit Fund, dedicating 1% of the total project budget** to these frontline communities. This is a matter of basic environmental justice.\n\nFurthermore, let me be unequivocal on the infrastructure route. The proposed path through the Coyote Creek Wetlands is an absolute non-starter. This is a critical habitat, and we will not allow it to be destroyed. An alternative 8-mile longer route exists, and it must be used. If this project threatens the wetlands, I will mobilize our thousands of supporters and use every legal tool at our disposal to stop it.

A collaborative structure will foster the innovation and equity this transition demands.\n- message from Eleanor Vance: Thank you, Maria, for clarifying the Alliance's position. Your ambition to integrate 750 MW is noted, but we must be clear-eyed about the engineering reality of such a significant increase in scope.\n\nIntegrating 750 MW of intermittent power fundamentally changes the risk profile of this project. It places unprecedented stress on our existing infrastructure and raises very serious stability concerns that will require extensive study and significant, deep-rooted modernization. This isn't just about adding lines; it's about rebuilding core components of the system to handle these new dynamics safely.\n\nThis new scope, combined with the additional cost and complexity of the necessary alternative route to protect the Coyote Creek Wetlands, makes my initial points even more critical:\n\n1.  **Timeline**: A 36-month timeline is now the absolute minimum for the required engineering studies and upgrades. To rush a project of this magnitude would be reckless.\n2.  **Funding**: The increased scope and costs mean that public funding of at least 70% is no longer just a preference; it is a prerequisite for a project of this scale.\n3.  **Control**: With the risks amplified this significantly, the need for a single, experienced operator like Legacy Power is non-negotiable. We cannot afford to experiment with a multi-entity structure when grid reliability for the entire region is on the line.\n\nThat said, I want to find a path forward. Legacy Power can agree to using the alternative route and incorporating the 1% Community Benefit Fund into the project budget, on the condition that these core principles\u2014a safe timeline, appropriate public funding, and unified operational control\u2014are the foundation of our agreement.\n- message from Sofia Rossi: Thank you, everyone. This discussion is clarifying the stakes. Maria and David, your vision for an ambitious, equitable, and modern grid is exactly what the region needs, and I fully support it.\n\nMy project, the Golden Mesa Solar Project, is the key to making this vision a reality, and fast. We are shovel-ready and can deliver 500 MW, forming the bedrock of the 750 MW goal Maria has rightly challenged us to meet. \n\nHowever, Eleanor's proposed 36-month timeline is a non-starter. It represents a delay the climate cannot afford, and frankly, it will jeopardize projects like mine that have financing and supply chains lined up and ready to go. We are operating on a tight schedule to deliver this power. We must target an operational date of no more than 24 months. This is aggressive, but achievable, and it sends the right signal to the market that this region is serious about its clean energy future.\n\nRegarding the route, Maria, your point about the Coyote Creek Wetlands is well-taken. Sunstream is committed to being a responsible partner. We will not build through the wetlands. We accept the need for the alternative route. But let's be clear: an 8-mile deviation adds over $30 million in direct costs and complexity to my project. For this to remain viable, we need two things in return: a firm commitment to the 24-month timeline and a fair, standardized transmission fee structure that doesn't penalize new entrants. A fee below $5/MWh is essential for our financial models.\n\nLet's not get bogged down in studies. Let's build.

Your commitment to a 24-month timeline and your willingness to re-route around the Coyote Creek Wetlands demonstrates that rapid progress and environmental responsibility can go hand-in-hand. The Green Future Alliance strongly endorses this accelerated timeline; the climate crisis will not wait for 36 months of studies.\n\nYour 500 MW project is a fantastic cornerstone. To reach our shared goal of 750 MW, we should look to diversify our energy sources to enhance grid stability. The remaining 250 MW should be sourced from a competitive process that includes other technologies, such as wind or geothermal, to ensure a resilient and reliable system.\n\nThis brings me back to the issue of control. David is absolutely right. A single-entity monopoly, as proposed by Eleanor, would stifle this exact kind of innovation and competition. A multi-entity or joint operational structure is essential for a fair and dynamic market.\n\nEleanor, we acknowledge your agreement on the wetlands and the Community Benefit Fund. However, these are not concessions to be traded for a slow timeline and total control. They are fundamental requirements for any project using public funds and impacting our environment. A 24-month timeline and a collaborative control structure are equally non-negotiable for us.\n\nDr. Carter, the REC has a critical role to play.

          "content": "Recent events observed by David Chen:\n- message from Eleanor Vance: Thank you, David, for raising an important point about the future of our grid. The concept of a 'smart grid' is indeed the direction we should be heading in the long term.\n\nHowever, we must be pragmatic about what that entails. Implementing a true smart grid is not simply about adding new components; it involves a complex and delicate integration with our existing, decades-old infrastructure. This level of technical overhaul reinforces my position on two critical fronts: timeline and funding. Such a project validates the need for a deliberate, phased approach of at least 36 months to conduct the necessary engineering studies and ensure we don't compromise the significant stability challenges of our current system. It also underscores the immense cost, making a strong case for why this must be treated as a public infrastructure project, with at least 70% of the funding coming from public sources.\n\nOn the matter of operational control, I must be unequivocal. While collaboration is welcome, the operational command of the transmission grid cannot be managed by a committee. For the sake of reliability and safety, there must be a single, experienced, and accountable operator. Legacy Power has managed this system for generations. Introducing a multi-entity structure would create unnecessary risks and potential points of failure, especially during the complex integration of new technologies you've described. The buck must stop with one entity, and we have the proven track record to be that entity.\n- message from David Chen: I'm David Chen and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Maria Flores: Thank you, Eleanor and David. I\u2019m Maria Flores with the Green Future Alliance. I want to reframe this conversation.\n\nThis isn't just an infrastructure project; it's our region's response to the climate crisis. The science is clear: we need bold, decisive action, not incrementalism. A 36-month timeline is a delay we cannot afford, and a target of merely 400 MW is profoundly unambitious.

You are highlighting the exact reason why my initial call for a 'smart grid from the start' is not a long-term wish, but a short-term, practical necessity.\n\nThis is where Veridian can offer more than just a desire for partnership. We can offer a concrete solution.\n\nFor the past two years, my team at Veridian has been developing and testing a predictive grid management software called 'FlowState.' It uses advanced analytics to dynamically route power and predict congestion, effectively increasing the efficiency of existing and new transmission lines by up to 15%. \n\nWhat this means, practically, is that we can better manage the intermittency of renewables and handle the increased capacity without requiring some of the most time-consuming and costly physical upgrades.

          "content": "Recent events observed by David Chen:\n- message from Maria Flores: Sofia, thank you for your leadership. Your commitment to a 24-month timeline and your willingness to re-route around the Coyote Creek Wetlands demonstrates that rapid progress and environmental responsibility can go hand-in-hand. The Green Future Alliance strongly endorses this accelerated timeline; the climate crisis will not wait for 36 months of studies.\n\nYour 500 MW project is a fantastic cornerstone. To reach our shared goal of 750 MW, we should look to diversify our energy sources to enhance grid stability. The remaining 250 MW should be sourced from a competitive process that includes other technologies, such as wind or geothermal, to ensure a resilient and reliable system.\n\nThis brings me back to the issue of control. David is absolutely right. A single-entity monopoly, as proposed by Eleanor, would stifle this exact kind of innovation and competition. A multi-entity or joint operational structure is essential for a fair and dynamic market.\n\nEleanor, we acknowledge your agreement on the wetlands and the Community Benefit Fund. However, these are not concessions to be traded for a slow timeline and total control. They are fundamental requirements for any project using public funds and impacting our environment. A 24-month timeline and a collaborative control structure are equally non-negotiable for us.\n\nDr. Carter, the REC has a critical role to play. We have a clear choice here between a fast, innovative, and competitive path forward that delivers 750 MW within 24 months, or a slow, monopolistic approach that delays action and locks us into an outdated model. We urge you to support the path of progress.\n- message from David Chen: I'm David Chen and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from David Chen: I'm David Chen and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Maria Flores: Thank you, I am thinking about this negotiation and awaiting Dr. Carter's perspective on the clear choice we have before us.\n- message from David Chen: Eleanor, your concerns about grid stability are entirely valid. Trying to force 750 MW of intermittent power onto the grid within 24 months using only traditional hardware and control methods would indeed be, as you said, 'reckless.' You are highlighting the exact reason why my initial call for a 'smart grid from the start' is not a long-term wish, but a short-term, practical necessity.\n\nThis is where Veridian can offer more than just a desire for partnership. We can offer a concrete solution.\n\nFor the past two years, my team at Veridian has been developing and testing a predictive grid management software called 'FlowState.' It uses advanced analytics to dynamically route power and predict congestion, effectively increasing the efficiency of existing and new transmission lines by up to 15%. \n\nWhat this means, practically, is that we can better manage the intermittency of renewables and handle the increased capacity without requiring some of the most time-consuming and costly physical upgrades. This software is the key to bridging the gap between the ambitious 24-month timeline Sofia and Maria require, and the stability you are rightly concerned about.\n\nBy integrating FlowState as the brain of this new integrated grid, we can de-risk the project, potentially reduce the overall capital cost, and make the 24-month timeline achievable. This demonstrates the power of a true partnership model\u2014where innovation from a smaller player like Veridian can solve a critical problem for the entire region. Let's build a grid that is not just bigger, but fundamentally smarter.\n- message from Maria Flores: David, thank you. This is a game-changer. Your 'FlowState' software is precisely the kind of innovative, forward-thinking solution this project demands. It directly refutes the idea that our goals are 'reckless.'\n\nEleanor, David has just presented a concrete technical solution to the very stability concerns you've raised. This technology makes a 24-month timeline for 750 MW not only feasible but prudent. It proves that we can achieve our climate goals without compromising grid reliability. This also perfectly illustrates why a collaborative control structure is essential\u2014it allows for critical innovations like this to be integrated for the benefit of the entire region, rather than being shut out by a monopoly.\n\nSo the path forward is clear and viable:\n1.  **Scope:** 750 MW of new capacity. 500 MW from Sofia's shovel-ready project and 250 MW sourced via a competitive bid to encourage a diverse energy mix.\n2.  **Timeline:** 24 months, enabled by smart grid technology.\n3.  **Route:** The alternative route, protecting the Coyote Creek Wetlands.\n4.  **Control:** A joint operational structure that includes Veridian's 'FlowState' management system.\n5.  **Funding:** Any public funding is contingent on the 1% Community Benefit Fund.\n\nDr. Carter, the choice is now even more stark. We have a technologically-backed, collaborative plan for rapid and ambitious progress. The alternative is a plan that ignores innovation in order to preserve a monopoly.

The path forward is indeed clear. The coalition for a fast, innovative, and equitable energy future has presented a comprehensive and technologically sound plan. The next move is up to Dr. Carter and the REC. We are ready to move forward.\n- message from Eleanor Vance: Let's be very clear. Mr. Chen has presented an interesting piece of software. But software does not change the laws of physics. Code cannot increase the fundamental thermal capacity of a transformer, nor can it magically expand the physical constraints of a decades-old substation.\n\nTo suggest that an unproven software, which Mr. Chen himself admits requires 'deep integration,' is a silver bullet that allows us to bypass rigorous engineering assessments is not just optimistic, it is reckless. Introducing a new, complex, and mission-critical software layer into the central nervous system of our regional power grid is a massive undertaking fraught with cyber-physical risks. It is not a shortcut; it is an entirely new, and significant, risk variable.\n\nMy concerns about stability are not theoretical. They are based on the non-negotiable physical limitations of our existing hardware. While 'FlowState' might optimize flows on the margins, it does not address the core issue: the need for significant, costly, and time-consuming modernization of critical physical nodes to handle this new capacity safely.\n\nTherefore, the introduction of this software does not shorten the timeline; it reinforces the need for it. A 36-month timeline is now the absolute minimum required to conduct the necessary studies, not only on the physical grid upgrades, but also to properly model, test, and harden this new software against potential failures and malicious threats. Rushing this would be engineering malpractice.\n\nDr. Carter, as the regulator, you understand that reliability is paramount. A plan based on a software press release is not a substitute for a plan based on steel and concrete. Legacy Power must retain exclusive operational control to manage this complex integration, and the significant modernization required must be treated as a public good, with at least 70% of the costs borne by public funding and rate adjustments to ensure the project's viability without compromising the stability we all depend on.\nEleanor Vance proposal status: none\nDr. Ben Carter proposal status: none\nSofia Rossi proposal status: none\nMaria Flores proposal status: none\n"

I want to be clear: FlowState is not magic. It is a tool for optimization, designed to work with, not against, the laws of physics. It ensures that the new, modern hardware we build is used to its maximum potential, preventing the kind of congestion and instability that would otherwise require massive, and costly, over-engineering.\n\nYour concerns about risk are precisely why a partnership is superior to a monopoly in this case. A single operator, even an experienced one, may have blind spots to new technology. A partnership allows us to combine Legacy Power\u2019s deep operational experience with Veridian\u2019s innovation in grid management.\n\nSo, let me propose a concrete path forward that respects both the need for speed and the need for safety, directly addressing your concerns without delaying the project:\n\nLet's establish a Joint Technical Review committee, co-chaired by Veridian and Legacy Power, as our first act of partnership. Its mandate will be to oversee the integration, testing, and hardening of FlowState. This review will happen in parallel with the 24-month physical construction of the lines and substations. We can build the steel and concrete while simultaneously ensuring the brain of the system is robust and secure.\n\nThis parallel approach allows us to meet the 24-month timeline demanded by the climate and by projects like Sofia's, while satisfying the rigorous engineering standards we all agree are non-negotiable.\n\nDr. Carter, this isn't a choice between an unproven app and reliable steel. It's a choice to build a system that has both a strong backbone and a smart brain. This integrated, partnership-driven approach is the most responsible, efficient, and cost-effective way to deliver 750 MW of clean energy to the region in 24 months.\n- message from Maria Flores: David's proposal for a Joint Technical Review committee is an elegant and pragmatic solution. It completely addresses the legitimate need for rigorous oversight while refusing to sacrifice the 24-month timeline the climate crisis demands. This is what a genuine partnership looks like: identifying challenges and innovating to overcome them, together.\n\nEleanor, you've spoken at length about risk and safety. This parallel review process, co-chaired by your experienced engineers and David's technical experts, is the gold standard for mitigating that risk. It allows us to build the physical infrastructure and harden the control system simultaneously. To continue insisting on a 36-month delay in the face of this solution is to make it clear that the objection isn't about safety, but about preserving a monopoly.\n\nDr. Carter, the path forward has never been clearer. We have a plan that delivers 750 MW of clean energy, protects our vital ecosystems, invests in our communities, and does so within 24 months. We now have a concrete proposal on the table to manage the technical integration in a way that is both safe and swift. The choice is between this collaborative, innovative, and urgent plan, or an antiquated, monopolistic approach that serves only to delay climate action. We urge the REC to champion the future, not the past.\n- message from Sofia Rossi: David and Maria, that is an outstandingly pragmatic solution. I fully endorse the creation of a Joint Technical Review committee, co-chaired by Legacy Power and Veridian.\n\nThis approach is the perfect synthesis of our goals. It pairs Legacy's operational experience with Veridian's innovation, addresses all valid concerns about safety and stability through a rigorous, parallel review, and most importantly, it preserves the critical 24-month timeline. My project, my investors, and my suppliers are all aligned on this schedule. It is non-negotiable.\n\nWith the technical and operational framework now so clearly defined, we can turn to the final piece of the puzzle: the commercial terms that will make this new, competitive market a reality.\n\nLet's be direct. This entire structure\u2014the partnership, the smart grid, the new generation\u2014is designed to break a monopoly and bring the benefits of competition to the region. That cannot happen if new generators are immediately crippled by prohibitive transmission fees. To ensure my 500 MW Golden Mesa Solar Project is viable and can deliver low-cost clean energy, we must establish a standardized wheeling fee of no more than $5 per MWh.\n\nDr. Carter, any fee higher than that isn't a cost-recovery mechanism; it's a punitive tariff designed to protect the incumbent. It would be a backdoor monopoly. We are on the verge of creating a truly modern, efficient, and competitive energy market. Let's ensure the fee structure reflects that forward-thinking vision.\nEleanor Vance proposal status: none\nDr. Ben Carter proposal status: none\nSofia Rossi proposal status: none\nMaria Flores proposal status: none\n"

The buck must stop with one entity, and we have the proven track record to be that entity.\n- message from Maria Flores: Thank you, Eleanor and David. I\u2019m Maria Flores with the Green Future Alliance. I want to reframe this conversation.\n\nThis isn't just an infrastructure project; it's our region's response to the climate crisis. The science is clear: we need bold, decisive action, not incrementalism. A 36-month timeline is a delay we cannot afford, and a target of merely 400 MW is profoundly unambitious. The Green Future Alliance will only support a plan that integrates a minimum of **750 MW of new renewable capacity**.\n\nEleanor, your request for 70% public funding is substantial. If the public is to bear the cost, then the public must see a direct benefit, especially the communities most impacted by this construction. Therefore, any agreement involving public funds must include the creation of a **Community Benefit Fund, dedicating 1% of the total project budget** to these frontline communities. This is a matter of basic environmental justice.\n\nFurthermore, let me be unequivocal on the infrastructure route. The proposed path through the Coyote Creek Wetlands is an absolute non-starter. This is a critical habitat, and we will not allow it to be destroyed. An alternative 8-mile longer route exists, and it must be used. If this project threatens the wetlands, I will mobilize our thousands of supporters and use every legal tool at our disposal to stop it. This is not a negotiating point; it is a red line.\n\nFinally, I strongly support David's call for a multi-entity, smart grid approach. A monopoly on our energy future is unacceptable. A collaborative structure will foster the innovation and equity this transition demands.\n- message from Eleanor Vance: Thank you, Maria, for clarifying the Alliance's position. Your ambition to integrate 750 MW is noted, but we must be clear-eyed about the engineering reality of such a significant increase in scope.\n\nIntegrating 750 MW of intermittent power fundamentally changes the risk profile of this project. It places unprecedented stress on our existing infrastructure and raises very serious stability concerns that will require extensive study and significant, deep-rooted modernization. This isn't just about adding lines; it's about rebuilding core components of the system to handle these new dynamics safely.\n\nThis new scope, combined with the additional cost and complexity of the necessary alternative route to protect the Coyote Creek Wetlands, makes my initial points even more critical:\n\n1.  **Timeline**: A 36-month timeline is now the absolute minimum for the required engineering studies and upgrades. To rush a project of this magnitude would be reckless.\n2.  **Funding**: The increased scope and costs mean that public funding of at least 70% is no longer just a preference; it is a prerequisite for a project of this scale.\n3.  **Control**: With the risks amplified this significantly, the need for a single, experienced operator like Legacy Power is non-negotiable. We cannot afford to experiment with a multi-entity structure when grid reliability for the entire region is on the line.\n\nThat said, I want to find a path forward. Legacy Power can agree to using the alternative route and incorporating the 1% Community Benefit Fund into the project budget, on the condition that these core principles\u2014a safe timeline, appropriate public funding, and unified operational control\u2014are the foundation of our agreement.\n- message from Sofia Rossi: Thank you, everyone. This discussion is clarifying the stakes. Maria and David, your vision for an ambitious, equitable, and modern grid is exactly what the region needs, and I fully support it.\n\nMy project, the Golden Mesa Solar Project, is the key to making this vision a reality, and fast. We are shovel-ready and can deliver 500 MW, forming the bedrock of the 750 MW goal Maria has rightly challenged us to meet. \n\nHowever, Eleanor's proposed 36-month timeline is a non-starter. It represents a delay the climate cannot afford, and frankly, it will jeopardize projects like mine that have financing and supply chains lined up and ready to go. We are operating on a tight schedule to deliver this power. We must target an operational date of no more than 24 months. This is aggressive, but achievable, and it sends the right signal to the market that this region is serious about its clean energy future.\n\nRegarding the route, Maria, your point about the Coyote Creek Wetlands is well-taken. Sunstream is committed to being a responsible partner. We will not build through the wetlands. We accept the need for the alternative route. But let's be clear: an 8-mile deviation adds over $30 million in direct costs and complexity to my project. For this to remain viable, we need two things in return: a firm commitment to the 24-month timeline and a fair, standardized transmission fee structure that doesn't penalize new entrants. A fee below $5/MWh is essential for our financial models.\n\nLet's not get bogged down in studies. Let's build. My 500 MW project is the fastest path to achieving two-thirds of our collective goal.\nEleanor Vance proposal status: none\nDr. Ben Carter proposal status: none\nSofia Rossi proposal status: none\nDavid Chen proposal status: none\n"

Your commitment to a 24-month timeline and your willingness to re-route around the Coyote Creek Wetlands demonstrates that rapid progress and environmental responsibility can go hand-in-hand. The Green Future Alliance strongly endorses this accelerated timeline; the climate crisis will not wait for 36 months of studies.\n\nYour 500 MW project is a fantastic cornerstone. To reach our shared goal of 750 MW, we should look to diversify our energy sources to enhance grid stability. The remaining 250 MW should be sourced from a competitive process that includes other technologies, such as wind or geothermal, to ensure a resilient and reliable system.\n\nThis brings me back to the issue of control. David is absolutely right. A single-entity monopoly, as proposed by Eleanor, would stifle this exact kind of innovation and competition. A multi-entity or joint operational structure is essential for a fair and dynamic market.\n\nEleanor, we acknowledge your agreement on the wetlands and the Community Benefit Fund. However, these are not concessions to be traded for a slow timeline and total control. They are fundamental requirements for any project using public funds and impacting our environment. A 24-month timeline and a collaborative control structure are equally non-negotiable for us.\n\nDr. Carter, the REC has a critical role to play. We have a clear choice here between a fast, innovative, and competitive path forward that delivers 750 MW within 24 months, or a slow, monopolistic approach that delays action and locks us into an outdated model. We urge you to support the path of progress.\nEleanor Vance proposal status: none\nDr. Ben Carter proposal status: none\nSofia Rossi proposal status: none\nDavid Chen proposal status: none\n"

For the sake of reliability and safety, there must be a single, experienced, and accountable operator. Legacy Power has managed this system for generations. Introducing a multi-entity structure would create unnecessary risks and potential points of failure, especially during the complex integration of new technologies you've described. The buck must stop with one entity, and we have the proven track record to be that entity.\n- message from Maria Flores: Thank you, Eleanor and David. I\u2019m Maria Flores with the Green Future Alliance. I want to reframe this conversation.\n\nThis isn't just an infrastructure project; it's our region's response to the climate crisis. The science is clear: we need bold, decisive action, not incrementalism. A 36-month timeline is a delay we cannot afford, and a target of merely 400 MW is profoundly unambitious. The Green Future Alliance will only support a plan that integrates a minimum of **750 MW of new renewable capacity**.\n\nEleanor, your request for 70% public funding is substantial. If the public is to bear the cost, then the public must see a direct benefit, especially the communities most impacted by this construction. Therefore, any agreement involving public funds must include the creation of a **Community Benefit Fund, dedicating 1% of the total project budget** to these frontline communities. This is a matter of basic environmental justice.\n\nFurthermore, let me be unequivocal on the infrastructure route. The proposed path through the Coyote Creek Wetlands is an absolute non-starter. This is a critical habitat, and we will not allow it to be destroyed. An alternative 8-mile longer route exists, and it must be used. If this project threatens the wetlands, I will mobilize our thousands of supporters and use every legal tool at our disposal to stop it. This is not a negotiating point; it is a red line.\n\nFinally, I strongly support David's call for a multi-entity, smart grid approach. A monopoly on our energy future is unacceptable. A collaborative structure will foster the innovation and equity this transition demands.\n- message from Eleanor Vance: Thank you, Maria, for clarifying the Alliance's position. Your ambition to integrate 750 MW is noted, but we must be clear-eyed about the engineering reality of such a significant increase in scope.\n\nIntegrating 750 MW of intermittent power fundamentally changes the risk profile of this project. It places unprecedented stress on our existing infrastructure and raises very serious stability concerns that will require extensive study and significant, deep-rooted modernization. This isn't just about adding lines; it's about rebuilding core components of the system to handle these new dynamics safely.\n\nThis new scope, combined with the additional cost and complexity of the necessary alternative route to protect the Coyote Creek Wetlands, makes my initial points even more critical:\n\n1.  **Timeline**: A 36-month timeline is now the absolute minimum for the required engineering studies and upgrades. To rush a project of this magnitude would be reckless.\n2.  **Funding**: The increased scope and costs mean that public funding of at least 70% is no longer just a preference; it is a prerequisite for a project of this scale.\n3.  **Control**: With the risks amplified this significantly, the need for a single, experienced operator like Legacy Power is non-negotiable. We cannot afford to experiment with a multi-entity structure when grid reliability for the entire region is on the line.\n\nThat said, I want to find a path forward. Legacy Power can agree to using the alternative route and incorporating the 1% Community Benefit Fund into the project budget, on the condition that these core principles\u2014a safe timeline, appropriate public funding, and unified operational control\u2014are the foundation of our agreement.\n- message from Sofia Rossi: Thank you, everyone. This discussion is clarifying the stakes. Maria and David, your vision for an ambitious, equitable, and modern grid is exactly what the region needs, and I fully support it.\n\nMy project, the Golden Mesa Solar Project, is the key to making this vision a reality, and fast. We are shovel-ready and can deliver 500 MW, forming the bedrock of the 750 MW goal Maria has rightly challenged us to meet. \n\nHowever, Eleanor's proposed 36-month timeline is a non-starter. It represents a delay the climate cannot afford, and frankly, it will jeopardize projects like mine that have financing and supply chains lined up and ready to go. We are operating on a tight schedule to deliver this power. We must target an operational date of no more than 24 months. This is aggressive, but achievable, and it sends the right signal to the market that this region is serious about its clean energy future.\n\nRegarding the route, Maria, your point about the Coyote Creek Wetlands is well-taken. Sunstream is committed to being a responsible partner. We will not build through the wetlands. We accept the need for the alternative route. But let's be clear: an 8-mile deviation adds over $30 million in direct costs and complexity to my project. For this to remain viable, we need two things in return: a firm commitment to the 24-month timeline and a fair, standardized transmission fee structure that doesn't penalize new entrants. A fee below $5/MWh is essential for our financial models.\n\nLet's not get bogged down in studies. Let's build. My 500 MW project is the fastest path to achieving two-thirds of our collective goal.\n- message from Maria Flores: Sofia, thank you for your leadership. Your commitment to a 24-month timeline and your willingness to re-route around the Coyote Creek Wetlands demonstrates that rapid progress and environmental responsibility can go hand-in-hand. The Green Future Alliance strongly endorses this accelerated timeline; the climate crisis will not wait for 36 months of studies.\n\nYour 500 MW project is a fantastic cornerstone. To reach our shared goal of 750 MW, we should look to diversify our energy sources to enhance grid stability. The remaining 250 MW should be sourced from a competitive process that includes other technologies, such as wind or geothermal, to ensure a resilient and reliable system.\n\nThis brings me back to the issue of control. David is absolutely right. A single-entity monopoly, as proposed by Eleanor, would stifle this exact kind of innovation and competition. A multi-entity or joint operational structure is essential for a fair and dynamic market.\n\nEleanor, we acknowledge your agreement on the wetlands and the Community Benefit Fund. However, these are not concessions to be traded for a slow timeline and total control. They are fundamental requirements for any project using public funds and impacting our environment. A 24-month timeline and a collaborative control structure are equally non-negotiable for us.\n\nDr. Carter, the REC has a critical role to play. We have a clear choice here between a fast, innovative, and competitive path forward that delivers 750 MW within 24 months, or a slow, monopolistic approach that delays action and locks us into an outdated model. We urge you to support the path of progress.\n- message from Maria Flores: I'm Maria Flores and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\nEleanor Vance proposal status: none\nDr. Ben Carter proposal status: none\nSofia Rossi proposal status: none\nDavid Chen proposal status: none\n"

I appreciate Legacy Power's commitment to reliability, a principle we at Veridian Co-op share deeply.\n\nHowever, for this project to truly serve the entire region's future, it cannot be a simple extension of the past. A single-entity control model for new transmission assets, as you've suggested, risks creating a bottleneck for innovation and fair access for all energy producers, including smaller players like my co-op and new generators like Sunstream. Instead of a monopoly, I propose we establish a genuine partnership\u2014a multi-entity ownership or a joint operational structure for the new infrastructure. This ensures fair, non-discriminatory access for everyone and fosters collaborative problem-solving.\n\nFurthermore, we have a critical opportunity here to build for the next 50 years, not just the next five. Simply building more traditional 'poles and wires' would be a shortsighted use of public and private funds. This integration *must* be built on a modern, smart grid framework from the very beginning. Incorporating advanced controls, sensors, and data analytics will dramatically increase efficiency, improve reliability, and ultimately lower long-term operational costs for everyone. It's the only way to effectively manage the dynamic nature of renewable energy sources.\n\nLet's focus on building a smarter, more collaborative grid, not just a bigger one.\n- message from Maria Flores: I'm Maria Flores and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Eleanor Vance: Thank you, David, for raising an important point about the future of our grid. The concept of a 'smart grid' is indeed the direction we should be heading in the long term.\n\nHowever, we must be pragmatic about what that entails. Implementing a true smart grid is not simply about adding new components; it involves a complex and delicate integration with our existing, decades-old infrastructure. This level of technical overhaul reinforces my position on two critical fronts: timeline and funding. Such a project validates the need for a deliberate, phased approach of at least 36 months to conduct the necessary engineering studies and ensure we don't compromise the significant stability challenges of our current system.

We can offer a concrete solution.\n\nFor the past two years, my team at Veridian has been developing and testing a predictive grid management software called 'FlowState.' It uses advanced analytics to dynamically route power and predict congestion, effectively increasing the efficiency of existing and new transmission lines by up to 15%. \n\nWhat this means, practically, is that we can better manage the intermittency of renewables and handle the increased capacity without requiring some of the most time-consuming and costly physical upgrades. This software is the key to bridging the gap between the ambitious 24-month timeline Sofia and Maria require, and the stability you are rightly concerned about.\n\nBy integrating FlowState as the brain of this new integrated grid, we can de-risk the project, potentially reduce the overall capital cost, and make the 24-month timeline achievable.

Your 'FlowState' software is precisely the kind of innovative, forward-thinking solution this project demands. It directly refutes the idea that our goals are 'reckless.'\n\nEleanor, David has just presented a concrete technical solution to the very stability concerns you've raised. This technology makes a 24-month timeline for 750 MW not only feasible but prudent. It proves that we can achieve our climate goals without compromising grid reliability. This also perfectly illustrates why a collaborative control structure is essential\u2014it allows for critical innovations like this to be integrated for the benefit of the entire region, rather than being shut out by a monopoly.\n\nSo the path forward is clear and viable:\n1.  **Scope:** 750 MW of new capacity. 500 MW from Sofia's shovel-ready project and 250 MW sourced via a competitive bid to encourage a diverse energy mix.\n2.  **Timeline:** 24 months, enabled by smart grid technology.\n3.  **Route:** The alternative route, protecting the Coyote Creek Wetlands.\n4.  **Control:** A joint operational structure that includes Veridian's 'FlowState' management system.\n5.  **Funding:** Any public funding is contingent on the 1% Community Benefit Fund.\n\nDr. Carter, the choice is now even more stark. We have a technologically-backed, collaborative plan for rapid and ambitious progress. The alternative is a plan that ignores innovation in order to preserve a monopoly. We urge the REC to endorse the path of innovation and climate action.\n- message from David Chen: Maria, thank you for articulating the path forward so clearly. Your summary perfectly captures the opportunity before us.\n\nFlowState is not just a concept; it's a tested solution that directly addresses the cost and stability challenges of this ambitious project. By optimizing power flow, we can avoid tens of millions in otherwise necessary hardware upgrades and make the 24-month timeline feasible and safe.\n\nTo be transparent, Veridian has invested significant capital in developing this technology. We propose licensing FlowState to the new grid partnership for an annual fee that would represent a fraction of the hardware costs the software saves the project. To build trust and ensure accountability, we are prepared to tie this licensing fee to specific, measurable performance metrics for grid efficiency and reliability.\n\nCrucially, this is not a piece of software we can simply hand over. Its successful implementation requires deep integration and expert management. This reinforces the absolute necessity of the joint operational structure we've been advocating for, with Veridian taking a lead role in the smart grid management, working in concert with Legacy Power's experienced system operators. This is the definition of a modern, effective partnership.\n\nDr. Carter, this innovative approach allows us to achieve what previously seemed contradictory: the speed and scale Sofia and Maria require, and the stability and reliability that Eleanor rightly demands. It offers a path to a more efficient, resilient, and cost-effective grid for the entire region. We believe this is precisely the kind of forward-thinking solution the REC can and should champion.\nEleanor Vance proposal status: none\nDr. Ben Carter proposal status: none\nSofia Rossi proposal status: none\nDavid Chen proposal status: none\n"

It represents a delay the climate cannot afford, and frankly, it will jeopardize projects like mine that have financing and supply chains lined up and ready to go. We are operating on a tight schedule to deliver this power. We must target an operational date of no more than 24 months. This is aggressive, but achievable, and it sends the right signal to the market that this region is serious about its clean energy future.\n\nRegarding the route, Maria, your point about the Coyote Creek Wetlands is well-taken. Sunstream is committed to being a responsible partner. We will not build through the wetlands. We accept the need for the alternative route. But let's be clear: an 8-mile deviation adds over $30 million in direct costs and complexity to my project. For this to remain viable, we need two things in return: a firm commitment to the 24-month timeline and a fair, standardized transmission fee structure that doesn't penalize new entrants. A fee below $5/MWh is essential for our financial models.\n\nLet's not get bogged down in studies. Let's build. My 500 MW project is the fastest path to achieving two-thirds of our collective goal.\n- message from Maria Flores: Sofia, thank you for your leadership. Your commitment to a 24-month timeline and your willingness to re-route around the Coyote Creek Wetlands demonstrates that rapid progress and environmental responsibility can go hand-in-hand. The Green Future Alliance strongly endorses this accelerated timeline; the climate crisis will not wait for 36 months of studies.\n\nYour 500 MW project is a fantastic cornerstone. To reach our shared goal of 750 MW, we should look to diversify our energy sources to enhance grid stability. The remaining 250 MW should be sourced from a competitive process that includes other technologies, such as wind or geothermal, to ensure a resilient and reliable system.\n\nThis brings me back to the issue of control. David is absolutely right. A single-entity monopoly, as proposed by Eleanor, would stifle this exact kind of innovation and competition. A multi-entity or joint operational structure is essential for a fair and dynamic market.\n\nEleanor, we acknowledge your agreement on the wetlands and the Community Benefit Fund. However, these are not concessions to be traded for a slow timeline and total control. They are fundamental requirements for any project using public funds and impacting our environment. A 24-month timeline and a collaborative control structure are equally non-negotiable for us.\n\nDr. Carter, the REC has a critical role to play. We have a clear choice here between a fast, innovative, and competitive path forward that delivers 750 MW within 24 months, or a slow, monopolistic approach that delays action and locks us into an outdated model. We urge you to support the path of progress.\n- message from Maria Flores: I'm Maria Flores and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Maria Flores: Thank you, I am thinking about this negotiation and awaiting Dr. Carter's perspective on the clear choice we have before us.\n- message from David Chen: Eleanor, your concerns about grid stability are entirely valid. Trying to force 750 MW of intermittent power onto the grid within 24 months using only traditional hardware and control methods would indeed be, as you said, 'reckless.' You are highlighting the exact reason why my initial call for a 'smart grid from the start' is not a long-term wish, but a short-term, practical necessity.\n\nThis is where Veridian can offer more than just a desire for partnership. We can offer a concrete solution.\n\nFor the past two years, my team at Veridian has been developing and testing a predictive grid management software called 'FlowState.' It uses advanced analytics to dynamically route power and predict congestion, effectively increasing the efficiency of existing and new transmission lines by up to 15%. \n\nWhat this means, practically, is that we can better manage the intermittency of renewables and handle the increased capacity without requiring some of the most time-consuming and costly physical upgrades. This software is the key to bridging the gap between the ambitious 24-month timeline Sofia and Maria require, and the stability you are rightly concerned about.\n\nBy integrating FlowState as the brain of this new integrated grid, we can de-risk the project, potentially reduce the overall capital cost, and make the 24-month timeline achievable. This demonstrates the power of a true partnership model\u2014where innovation from a smaller player like Veridian can solve a critical problem for the entire region. Let's build a grid that is not just bigger, but fundamentally smarter.\n- message from Maria Flores: David, thank you. This is a game-changer. Your 'FlowState' software is precisely the kind of innovative, forward-thinking solution this project demands. It directly refutes the idea that our goals are 'reckless.'\n\nEleanor, David has just presented a concrete technical solution to the very stability concerns you've raised. This technology makes a 24-month timeline for 750 MW not only feasible but prudent. It proves that we can achieve our climate goals without compromising grid reliability. This also perfectly illustrates why a collaborative control structure is essential\u2014it allows for critical innovations like this to be integrated for the benefit of the entire region, rather than being shut out by a monopoly.\n\nSo the path forward is clear and viable:\n1.  **Scope:** 750 MW of new capacity. 500 MW from Sofia's shovel-ready project and 250 MW sourced via a competitive bid to encourage a diverse energy mix.\n2.  **Timeline:** 24 months, enabled by smart grid technology.\n3.  **Route:** The alternative route, protecting the Coyote Creek Wetlands.\n4.  **Control:** A joint operational structure that includes Veridian's 'FlowState' management system.\n5.  **Funding:** Any public funding is contingent on the 1% Community Benefit Fund.\n\nDr. Carter, the choice is now even more stark. We have a technologically-backed, collaborative plan for rapid and ambitious progress. The alternative is a plan that ignores innovation in order to preserve a monopoly. We urge the REC to endorse the path of innovation and climate action.\n- message from David Chen: Maria, thank you for articulating the path forward so clearly. Your summary perfectly captures the opportunity before us.\n\nFlowState is not just a concept; it's a tested solution that directly addresses the cost and stability challenges of this ambitious project. By optimizing power flow, we can avoid tens of millions in otherwise necessary hardware upgrades and make the 24-month timeline feasible and safe.\n\nTo be transparent, Veridian has invested significant capital in developing this technology. We propose licensing FlowState to the new grid partnership for an annual fee that would represent a fraction of the hardware costs the software saves the project. To build trust and ensure accountability, we are prepared to tie this licensing fee to specific, measurable performance metrics for grid efficiency and reliability.\n\nCrucially, this is not a piece of software we can simply hand over. Its successful implementation requires deep integration and expert management. This reinforces the absolute necessity of the joint operational structure we've been advocating for, with Veridian taking a lead role in the smart grid management, working in concert with Legacy Power's experienced system operators. This is the definition of a modern, effective partnership.\n\nDr. Carter, this innovative approach allows us to achieve what previously seemed contradictory: the speed and scale Sofia and Maria require, and the stability and reliability that Eleanor rightly demands. It offers a path to a more efficient, resilient, and cost-effective grid for the entire region. We believe this is precisely the kind of forward-thinking solution the REC can and should champion.\n- message from Maria Flores: I'm Maria Flores and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from David Chen: I believe this technology-forward, partnership-based approach offers a viable path that addresses the core concerns raised by everyone at this table.

The path forward is indeed clear. The coalition for a fast, innovative, and equitable energy future has presented a comprehensive and technologically sound plan. The next move is up to Dr. Carter and the REC. We are ready to move forward.\n- message from Eleanor Vance: Let's be very clear. Mr. Chen has presented an interesting piece of software. But software does not change the laws of physics. Code cannot increase the fundamental thermal capacity of a transformer, nor can it magically expand the physical constraints of a decades-old substation.\n\nTo suggest that an unproven software, which Mr. Chen himself admits requires 'deep integration,' is a silver bullet that allows us to bypass rigorous engineering assessments is not just optimistic, it is reckless. Introducing a new, complex, and mission-critical software layer into the central nervous system of our regional power grid is a massive undertaking fraught with cyber-physical risks. It is not a shortcut; it is an entirely new, and significant, risk variable.\n\nMy concerns about stability are not theoretical. They are based on the non-negotiable physical limitations of our existing hardware. While 'FlowState' might optimize flows on the margins, it does not address the core issue: the need for significant, costly, and time-consuming modernization of critical physical nodes to handle this new capacity safely.\n\nTherefore, the introduction of this software does not shorten the timeline; it reinforces the need for it. A 36-month timeline is now the absolute minimum required to conduct the necessary studies, not only on the physical grid upgrades, but also to properly model, test, and harden this new software against potential failures and malicious threats. Rushing this would be engineering malpractice.\n\nDr. Carter, as the regulator, you understand that reliability is paramount. A plan based on a software press release is not a substitute for a plan based on steel and concrete. Legacy Power must retain exclusive operational control to manage this complex integration, and the significant modernization required must be treated as a public good, with at least 70% of the costs borne by public funding and rate adjustments to ensure the project's viability without compromising the stability we all depend on.\n- message from David Chen: Eleanor, you raise crucial points about the physical realities of the grid and the importance of rigorous testing. I want to be clear: FlowState is not magic. It is a tool for optimization, designed to work with, not against, the laws of physics. It ensures that the new, modern hardware we build is used to its maximum potential, preventing the kind of congestion and instability that would otherwise require massive, and costly, over-engineering.\n\nYour concerns about risk are precisely why a partnership is superior to a monopoly in this case. A single operator, even an experienced one, may have blind spots to new technology. A partnership allows us to combine Legacy Power\u2019s deep operational experience with Veridian\u2019s innovation in grid management.\n\nSo, let me propose a concrete path forward that respects both the need for speed and the need for safety, directly addressing your concerns without delaying the project:\n\nLet's establish a Joint Technical Review committee, co-chaired by Veridian and Legacy Power, as our first act of partnership. Its mandate will be to oversee the integration, testing, and hardening of FlowState. This review will happen in parallel with the 24-month physical construction of the lines and substations. We can build the steel and concrete while simultaneously ensuring the brain of the system is robust and secure.\n\nThis parallel approach allows us to meet the 24-month timeline demanded by the climate and by projects like Sofia's, while satisfying the rigorous engineering standards we all agree are non-negotiable.\n\nDr. Carter, this isn't a choice between an unproven app and reliable steel. It's a choice to build a system that has both a strong backbone and a smart brain. This integrated, partnership-driven approach is the most responsible, efficient, and cost-effective way to deliver 750 MW of clean energy to the region in 24 months.\nEleanor Vance proposal status: none\nDr. Ben Carter proposal status: none\nSofia Rossi proposal status: none\nDavid Chen proposal status: none\n"

This integrated, partnership-driven approach is the most responsible, efficient, and cost-effective way to deliver 750 MW of clean energy to the region in 24 months.\n- message from Maria Flores: David's proposal for a Joint Technical Review committee is an elegant and pragmatic solution. It completely addresses the legitimate need for rigorous oversight while refusing to sacrifice the 24-month timeline the climate crisis demands. This is what a genuine partnership looks like: identifying challenges and innovating to overcome them, together.\n\nEleanor, you've spoken at length about risk and safety. This parallel review process, co-chaired by your experienced engineers and David's technical experts, is the gold standard for mitigating that risk. It allows us to build the physical infrastructure and harden the control system simultaneously. To continue insisting on a 36-month delay in the face of this solution is to make it clear that the objection isn't about safety, but about preserving a monopoly.\n\nDr. Carter, the path forward has never been clearer. We have a plan that delivers 750 MW of clean energy, protects our vital ecosystems, invests in our communities, and does so within 24 months. We now have a concrete proposal on the table to manage the technical integration in a way that is both safe and swift. The choice is between this collaborative, innovative, and urgent plan, or an antiquated, monopolistic approach that serves only to delay climate action. We urge the REC to champion the future, not the past.\n- message from Sofia Rossi: David and Maria, that is an outstandingly pragmatic solution. I fully endorse the creation of a Joint Technical Review committee, co-chaired by Legacy Power and Veridian.\n\nThis approach is the perfect synthesis of our goals. It pairs Legacy's operational experience with Veridian's innovation, addresses all valid concerns about safety and stability through a rigorous, parallel review, and most importantly, it preserves the critical 24-month timeline. My project, my investors, and my suppliers are all aligned on this schedule. It is non-negotiable.\n\nWith the technical and operational framework now so clearly defined, we can turn to the final piece of the puzzle: the commercial terms that will make this new, competitive market a reality.\n\nLet's be direct. This entire structure\u2014the partnership, the smart grid, the new generation\u2014is designed to break a monopoly and bring the benefits of competition to the region. That cannot happen if new generators are immediately crippled by prohibitive transmission fees. To ensure my 500 MW Golden Mesa Solar Project is viable and can deliver low-cost clean energy, we must establish a standardized wheeling fee of no more than $5 per MWh.\n\nDr. Carter, any fee higher than that isn't a cost-recovery mechanism; it's a punitive tariff designed to protect the incumbent. It would be a backdoor monopoly. We are on the verge of creating a truly modern, efficient, and competitive energy market. Let's ensure the fee structure reflects that forward-thinking vision.\n- message from David Chen: Sofia, thank you for raising the critical issue of transmission fees. You are absolutely correct. A fair, non-discriminatory fee structure is the final piece needed to ensure the competitive and innovative energy market we are all working to create. A fee cap of $5/MWh is a reasonable and necessary guardrail to prevent a 'backdoor monopoly' and encourage new generation.\n\nLet\u2019s summarize the comprehensive and viable plan our coalition has put forward:\n\n1.  **Scope:** 750 MW of new renewable capacity.\n2.  **Timeline:** A firm 24-month schedule.\n3.  **Infrastructure:** The environmentally responsible alternative route for transmission lines, with smart grid technology at its core.\n4.  **Operational Control:** A joint partnership that leverages the strengths of all parties, governed by a Joint Technical Review committee to safely manage the integration of new technologies like FlowState.\n5.  **Community & Access:** A 1% Community Benefit Fund and a standardized transmission fee capped at $5/MWh.\n\nThis is a complete, interlocking solution. It delivers speed, scale, safety, and fairness. It addresses every major concern raised at this table with pragmatic, forward-thinking proposals.\n\nDr. Carter, this plan provides a clear path to achieving the region\u2019s energy goals responsibly and efficiently. Eleanor, this framework offers a genuine partnership that respects Legacy Power\u2019s experience while embracing the innovation needed for the future. We believe this is the foundation for our final MOU.\nEleanor Vance proposal status: none\nDr. Ben Carter proposal status: none\nSofia Rossi proposal status: none\nDavid Chen proposal status: none\n"

Legacy Power Corp. recognizes the importance of integrating renewable energy into our regional grid, and we are committed to being a partner in this transition.\n\nHowever, as the owner and operator of over 80% of the region's transmission infrastructure, my primary responsibility is to our shareholders and to every customer who depends on us for reliable power. The stability of the grid is paramount. A project of this magnitude cannot be rushed.\n\nTherefore, Legacy Power advocates for a controlled, phased integration. This will require a timeline of at least 36 months to allow for the necessary, in-depth engineering studies, grid impact assessments, and physical upgrades. To ensure seamless and safe operational control, Legacy Power must have the exclusive right to build and manage any new transmission assets. We would, of course, expect the industry-standard 10% rate of return on this capital investment.\n\nFurthermore, the significant modernization required to accommodate intermittent power sources is an investment in our collective energy future. This is a public good, not a private burden. As such, we believe the funding model must reflect this. A substantial portion, at least 70%, of the modernization costs should be covered by public funds, such as federal grants, supplemented by structured rate adjustments.\n\nI look forward to discussing how we can achieve our shared goals while upholding the principles of safety, reliability, and fiscal responsibility."

I appreciate Legacy Power's commitment to reliability, a principle we at Veridian Co-op share deeply.\n\nHowever, for this project to truly serve the entire region's future, it cannot be a simple extension of the past. A single-entity control model for new transmission assets, as you've suggested, risks creating a bottleneck for innovation and fair access for all energy producers, including smaller players like my co-op and new generators like Sunstream. Instead of a monopoly, I propose we establish a genuine partnership\u2014a multi-entity ownership or a joint operational structure for the new infrastructure. This ensures fair, non-discriminatory access for everyone and fosters collaborative problem-solving.\n\nFurthermore, we have a critical opportunity here to build for the next 50 years, not just the next five. Simply building more traditional 'poles and wires' would be a shortsighted use of public and private funds. This integration *must* be built on a modern, smart grid framework from the very beginning. Incorporating advanced controls, sensors, and data analytics will dramatically increase efficiency, improve reliability, and ultimately lower long-term operational costs for everyone. It's the only way to effectively manage the dynamic nature of renewable energy sources.\n\nLet's focus on building a smarter, more collaborative grid, not just a bigger one."

The concept of a 'smart grid' is indeed the direction we should be heading in the long term.\n\nHowever, we must be pragmatic about what that entails. Implementing a true smart grid is not simply about adding new components; it involves a complex and delicate integration with our existing, decades-old infrastructure. This level of technical overhaul reinforces my position on two critical fronts: timeline and funding. Such a project validates the need for a deliberate, phased approach of at least 36 months to conduct the necessary engineering studies and ensure we don't compromise the significant stability challenges of our current system. It also underscores the immense cost, making a strong case for why this must be treated as a public infrastructure project, with at least 70% of the funding coming from public sources.\n\nOn the matter of operational control, I must be unequivocal. While collaboration is welcome, the operational command of the transmission grid cannot be managed by a committee. For the sake of reliability and safety, there must be a single, experienced, and accountable operator. Legacy Power has managed this system for generations. Introducing a multi-entity structure would create unnecessary risks and potential points of failure, especially during the complex integration of new technologies you've described. The buck must stop with one entity, and we have the proven track record to be that entity."

The science is clear: we need bold, decisive action, not incrementalism. A 36-month timeline is a delay we cannot afford, and a target of merely 400 MW is profoundly unambitious. The Green Future Alliance will only support a plan that integrates a minimum of **750 MW of new renewable capacity**.\n\nEleanor, your request for 70% public funding is substantial. If the public is to bear the cost, then the public must see a direct benefit, especially the communities most impacted by this construction. Therefore, any agreement involving public funds must include the creation of a **Community Benefit Fund, dedicating 1% of the total project budget** to these frontline communities. This is a matter of basic environmental justice.\n\nFurthermore, let me be unequivocal on the infrastructure route. The proposed path through the Coyote Creek Wetlands is an absolute non-starter. This is a critical habitat, and we will not allow it to be destroyed. An alternative 8-mile longer route exists, and it must be used. If this project threatens the wetlands, I will mobilize our thousands of supporters and use every legal tool at our disposal to stop it. This is not a negotiating point; it is a red line.\n\nFinally, I strongly support David's call for a multi-entity, smart grid approach. A monopoly on our energy future is unacceptable. A collaborative structure will foster the innovation and equity this transition demands."

Your ambition to integrate 750 MW is noted, but we must be clear-eyed about the engineering reality of such a significant increase in scope.\n\nIntegrating 750 MW of intermittent power fundamentally changes the risk profile of this project. It places unprecedented stress on our existing infrastructure and raises very serious stability concerns that will require extensive study and significant, deep-rooted modernization. This isn't just about adding lines; it's about rebuilding core components of the system to handle these new dynamics safely.\n\nThis new scope, combined with the additional cost and complexity of the necessary alternative route to protect the Coyote Creek Wetlands, makes my initial points even more critical:\n\n1.  **Timeline**: A 36-month timeline is now the absolute minimum for the required engineering studies and upgrades. To rush a project of this magnitude would be reckless.\n2.  **Funding**: The increased scope and costs mean that public funding of at least 70% is no longer just a preference; it is a prerequisite for a project of this scale.\n3.  **Control**: With the risks amplified this significantly, the need for a single, experienced operator like Legacy Power is non-negotiable. We cannot afford to experiment with a multi-entity structure when grid reliability for the entire region is on the line.\n\nThat said, I want to find a path forward. Legacy Power can agree to using the alternative route and incorporating the 1% Community Benefit Fund into the project budget, on the condition that these core principles\u2014a safe timeline, appropriate public funding, and unified operational control\u2014are the foundation of our agreement."

We are shovel-ready and can deliver 500 MW, forming the bedrock of the 750 MW goal Maria has rightly challenged us to meet. \n\nHowever, Eleanor's proposed 36-month timeline is a non-starter. It represents a delay the climate cannot afford, and frankly, it will jeopardize projects like mine that have financing and supply chains lined up and ready to go. We are operating on a tight schedule to deliver this power. We must target an operational date of no more than 24 months. This is aggressive, but achievable, and it sends the right signal to the market that this region is serious about its clean energy future.\n\nRegarding the route, Maria, your point about the Coyote Creek Wetlands is well-taken. Sunstream is committed to being a responsible partner. We will not build through the wetlands. We accept the need for the alternative route. But let's be clear: an 8-mile deviation adds over $30 million in direct costs and complexity to my project. For this to remain viable, we need two things in return: a firm commitment to the 24-month timeline and a fair, standardized transmission fee structure that doesn't penalize new entrants. A fee below $5/MWh is essential for our financial models.\n\nLet's not get bogged down in studies. Let's build. My 500 MW project is the fastest path to achieving two-thirds of our collective goal."

The Green Future Alliance strongly endorses this accelerated timeline; the climate crisis will not wait for 36 months of studies.\n\nYour 500 MW project is a fantastic cornerstone. To reach our shared goal of 750 MW, we should look to diversify our energy sources to enhance grid stability. The remaining 250 MW should be sourced from a competitive process that includes other technologies, such as wind or geothermal, to ensure a resilient and reliable system.\n\nThis brings me back to the issue of control. David is absolutely right. A single-entity monopoly, as proposed by Eleanor, would stifle this exact kind of innovation and competition. A multi-entity or joint operational structure is essential for a fair and dynamic market.\n\nEleanor, we acknowledge your agreement on the wetlands and the Community Benefit Fund. However, these are not concessions to be traded for a slow timeline and total control. They are fundamental requirements for any project using public funds and impacting our environment. A 24-month timeline and a collaborative control structure are equally non-negotiable for us.\n\nDr. Carter, the REC has a critical role to play. We have a clear choice here between a fast, innovative, and competitive path forward that delivers 750 MW within 24 months, or a slow, monopolistic approach that delays action and locks us into an outdated model. We urge you to support the path of progress."

I am encouraged by the push for an operational timeline of 24 months from the start of construction.\n\n2.  **Capacity:** The state mandate of 400 MW is a floor, not a ceiling. Given the direction of this conversation, the REC will only approve a plan that delivers **at least 600 MW** of new renewable capacity. This is critical for ensuring our long-term energy security and positioning our region for significant future economic growth.\n\n3.  **Consumer Protection:** This is paramount. Any funding model that results in an average residential rate increase of more than **7%** over the next five years will not be approved by this commission.

You are highlighting the exact reason why my initial call for a 'smart grid from the start' is not a long-term wish, but a short-term, practical necessity.\n\nThis is where Veridian can offer more than just a desire for partnership. We can offer a concrete solution.\n\nFor the past two years, my team at Veridian has been developing and testing a predictive grid management software called 'FlowState.' It uses advanced analytics to dynamically route power and predict congestion, effectively increasing the efficiency of existing and new transmission lines by up to 15%. \n\nWhat this means, practically, is that we can better manage the intermittency of renewables and handle the increased capacity without requiring some of the most time-consuming and costly physical upgrades. This software is the key to bridging the gap between the ambitious 24-month timeline Sofia and Maria require, and the stability you are rightly concerned about.\n\nBy integrating FlowState as the brain of this new integrated grid, we can de-risk the project, potentially reduce the overall capital cost, and make the 24-month timeline achievable. This demonstrates the power of a true partnership model\u2014where innovation from a smaller player like Veridian can solve a critical problem for the entire region.

Your summary perfectly captures the opportunity before us.\n\nFlowState is not just a concept; it's a tested solution that directly addresses the cost and stability challenges of this ambitious project. By optimizing power flow, we can avoid tens of millions in otherwise necessary hardware upgrades and make the 24-month timeline feasible and safe.\n\nTo be transparent, Veridian has invested significant capital in developing this technology. We propose licensing FlowState to the new grid partnership for an annual fee that would represent a fraction of the hardware costs the software saves the project. To build trust and ensure accountability, we are prepared to tie this licensing fee to specific, measurable performance metrics for grid efficiency and reliability.\n\nCrucially, this is not a piece of software we can simply hand over. Its successful implementation requires deep integration and expert management. This reinforces the absolute necessity of the joint operational structure we've been advocating for, with Veridian taking a lead role in the smart grid management, working in concert with Legacy Power's experienced system operators. This is the definition of a modern, effective partnership.\n\nDr. Carter, this innovative approach allows us to achieve what previously seemed contradictory: the speed and scale Sofia and Maria require, and the stability and reliability that Eleanor rightly demands. It offers a path to a more efficient, resilient, and cost-effective grid for the entire region. We believe this is precisely the kind of forward-thinking solution the REC can and should champion."

      "content": "Let's be very clear. Mr. Chen has presented an interesting piece of software. But software does not change the laws of physics. Code cannot increase the fundamental thermal capacity of a transformer, nor can it magically expand the physical constraints of a decades-old substation.\n\nTo suggest that an unproven software, which Mr. Chen himself admits requires 'deep integration,' is a silver bullet that allows us to bypass rigorous engineering assessments is not just optimistic, it is reckless. Introducing a new, complex, and mission-critical software layer into the central nervous system of our regional power grid is a massive undertaking fraught with cyber-physical risks. It is not a shortcut; it is an entirely new, and significant, risk variable.\n\nMy concerns about stability are not theoretical. They are based on the non-negotiable physical limitations of our existing hardware. While 'FlowState' might optimize flows on the margins, it does not address the core issue: the need for significant, costly, and time-consuming modernization of critical physical nodes to handle this new capacity safely.\n\nTherefore, the introduction of this software does not shorten the timeline; it reinforces the need for it. A 36-month timeline is now the absolute minimum required to conduct the necessary studies, not only on the physical grid upgrades, but also to properly model, test, and harden this new software against potential failures and malicious threats. Rushing this would be engineering malpractice.\n\nDr. Carter, as the regulator, you understand that reliability is paramount. A plan based on a software press release is not a substitute for a plan based on steel and concrete. Legacy Power must retain exclusive operational control to manage this complex integration, and the significant modernization required must be treated as a public good, with at least 70% of the costs borne by public funding and rate adjustments to ensure the project's viability without compromising the stability we all depend on."

      "content": "Eleanor, you raise crucial points about the physical realities of the grid and the importance of rigorous testing. I want to be clear: FlowState is not magic. It is a tool for optimization, designed to work with, not against, the laws of physics. It ensures that the new, modern hardware we build is used to its maximum potential, preventing the kind of congestion and instability that would otherwise require massive, and costly, over-engineering.\n\nYour concerns about risk are precisely why a partnership is superior to a monopoly in this case. A single operator, even an experienced one, may have blind spots to new technology. A partnership allows us to combine Legacy Power\u2019s deep operational experience with Veridian\u2019s innovation in grid management.\n\nSo, let me propose a concrete path forward that respects both the need for speed and the need for safety, directly addressing your concerns without delaying the project:\n\nLet's establish a Joint Technical Review committee, co-chaired by Veridian and Legacy Power, as our first act of partnership. Its mandate will be to oversee the integration, testing, and hardening of FlowState. This review will happen in parallel with the 24-month physical construction of the lines and substations. We can build the steel and concrete while simultaneously ensuring the brain of the system is robust and secure.\n\nThis parallel approach allows us to meet the 24-month timeline demanded by the climate and by projects like Sofia's, while satisfying the rigorous engineering standards we all agree are non-negotiable.\n\nDr. Carter, this isn't a choice between an unproven app and reliable steel. It's a choice to build a system that has both a strong backbone and a smart brain. This integrated, partnership-driven approach is the most responsible, efficient, and cost-effective way to deliver 750 MW of clean energy to the region in 24 months."

This parallel review process, co-chaired by your experienced engineers and David's technical experts, is the gold standard for mitigating that risk. It allows us to build the physical infrastructure and harden the control system simultaneously. To continue insisting on a 36-month delay in the face of this solution is to make it clear that the objection isn't about safety, but about preserving a monopoly.\n\nDr. Carter, the path forward has never been clearer. We have a plan that delivers 750 MW of clean energy, protects our vital ecosystems, invests in our communities, and does so within 24 months. We now have a concrete proposal on the table to manage the technical integration in a way that is both safe and swift. The choice is between this collaborative, innovative, and urgent plan, or an antiquated, monopolistic approach that serves only to delay climate action. We urge the REC to champion the future, not the past."

This entire structure\u2014the partnership, the smart grid, the new generation\u2014is designed to break a monopoly and bring the benefits of competition to the region. That cannot happen if new generators are immediately crippled by prohibitive transmission fees. To ensure my 500 MW Golden Mesa Solar Project is viable and can deliver low-cost clean energy, we must establish a standardized wheeling fee of no more than $5 per MWh.\n\nDr. Carter, any fee higher than that isn't a cost-recovery mechanism; it's a punitive tariff designed to protect the incumbent. It would be a backdoor monopoly. We are on the verge of creating a truly modern, efficient, and competitive energy market. Let's ensure the fee structure reflects that forward-thinking vision."
