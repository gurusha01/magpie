I want to be direct about the scale and nature of our proposed project, as it's truly a paradigm shift in computing infrastructure.\n\nNexus AI is prepared to invest $1.2 billion to construct a state-of-the-art supercomputing facility in Oakridge, dedicated to training the next generation of artificial intelligence. This isn't just another data center; it's the engine for the future of AI, and it has very specific and demanding requirements.\n\nFirst, to Marcus at Westwood Energy: our power needs are substantial. We require a guaranteed 250 MW from day one, with a contractually secured path to 500 MW within five years. Critically, this power must be exceptionally stable \u2013 'five nines' availability is not a luxury for us, it's a necessity to prevent catastrophic losses during multi-million dollar training runs.\n\nSecond, to Mayor Miller: site location is paramount. To achieve the low-latency network performance our models demand, the facility must be located within one mile of the L3/GTT fiber trunks. As part of any land deal, we will require the inclusion of dark fiber access rights. To make a project of this magnitude financially viable, we will also need a significant economic incentive package, and we're targeting a 75% property tax abatement for the first 15 years.\n\nWe believe this represents a transformative opportunity for Oakridge to become a global hub for AI development. We are, of course, committed to being a responsible partner and look forward to discussing how we can achieve this in a sustainable way. I'm keen to hear your initial thoughts.\n- message from Brenda Chen: Good morning, all. Brenda Chen from Titan Cloud Services. It's a pleasure to be here.\n\nDr. Finch, your vision for Nexus AI is certainly ambitious, and we at Titan appreciate that kind of forward-thinking. We are here today for a similar reason: to establish our next major North American campus, a long-term, multi-billion dollar investment in the future of cloud infrastructure.\n\nOur model is built on scale and long-term efficiency. To that end, our primary requirement is land. We are looking to acquire a single, contiguous parcel of at least 500 acres of developable land, with zoning secured for a multi-building campus and rights for future expansion up to 800 acres. This scale is fundamental to our operational model and our ability to grow with the community over the coming decades.\n\nOn the energy front, our needs differ slightly in their trajectory. We project an initial power draw of around 100 MW for our first phase, but this will grow steadily as our campus expands. Therefore, our focus is on securing a long-term, 20-year Power Purchase Agreement that provides predictable, low-cost energy. This stability is key to our investment. And I'll echo Dr. Finch's sentiment on reliability; building a resilient and redundant power infrastructure is a strong preference for us and a clear benefit for the entire community's grid.\n\nFinally, Mayor Miller, Titan Cloud believes that our most successful investments are those made in partnership with the community. We are eager to discuss establishing a meaningful public-private partnership, including funding for local STEM education programs. We want to be a true corporate citizen in Oakridge.\n\nI look forward to finding a path forward that accommodates the exciting potential of both our companies and the long-term prosperity of the city.\n- message from Marcus Vance: I'm Marcus Vance and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Dr. Isabella Rossi: Good morning, everyone. Dr. Isabella Rossi, CEO of Solara Innovations. It's truly inspiring to hear the ambitious visions put forth by both Nexus AI and Titan Cloud.\n\nDr. Finch, Ms. Chen, you've outlined a combined initial power need of 350 MW. I don't see this as a challenge; I see it as a historic opportunity to create a new paradigm for how the tech industry is powered. We can, and should, build this new infrastructure on a foundation of clean, reliable, and cost-effective renewable energy.\n\nTo that end, I have a proposal that directly addresses your needs for land, cost-stability, and corporate responsibility. Ms. Chen, your request for a 500+ acre campus is the perfect canvas. Solara Innovations proposes an integrated co-location model: we will build, own, and operate a large-scale solar farm and battery storage facility directly on the data center campus. This approach maximizes land-use efficiency, creates a direct and highly resilient power source, and provides the predictable, low-cost energy you seek through a long-term Power Purchase Agreement.\n\nFor a project that will define Oakridge's future, we must set a new standard. I strongly advocate that this Development Agreement include a binding commitment for the new facilities to source a minimum of 75% of their annual energy consumption from new, locally-sited renewable generation. This isn't just an environmental goal; it's a strategic investment in a resilient, future-proof energy infrastructure.\n\nDr. Finch, your requirement for 'five nines' availability is well-understood. Our integrated battery storage is key to this, smoothing solar's output to provide a firm, consistent power supply that forms the backbone of a 24/7 carbon-free energy solution. We can engineer a system that delivers the stability you need.\n\nThis is our chance to prove that the future of technology can be powered by the energy of the future. I look forward to working with all of you to make it happen.\n- message from Mayor Susan Miller: I'm Mayor Susan Miller and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from David Chen: Good morning, everyone. David Chen with the Oakridge Environmental Alliance. I appreciate the ambitious visions presented by Nexus AI and Titan Cloud, and Dr. Rossi's focus on a sustainable energy future.\n\nThe Alliance is not opposed to development, but we are uncompromising when it comes to ensuring it is done responsibly. A project of this magnitude brings not just economic opportunity, but also significant environmental risk that must be addressed from the outset.\n\nWhile the discussion has focused on power and land, we must address the most critical and finite resource for Oakridge: water. Data centers are immensely thirsty. Our aquifer is fragile and already under stress. Therefore, the Alliance must insist on a strict, non-negotiable cap for this project's water use: no more than 500,000 gallons drawn from the Oakridge aquifer per day. This is a hard limit necessary to safeguard our community's water supply during increasingly common drought conditions.\n\nSecond, regarding land use. Ms. Chen, a campus of 500 to 800 acres represents a massive footprint. To mitigate the impact on local wildlife, we will require a permanent conservation easement on a minimum of 25% of any land parcel acquired. This is essential to protect the critical habitat of the endangered Bell's vireo, a species integral to our local ecosystem.\n\nFinally, for a project of this scale to proceed with public trust, the process must be transparent and rigorous. We will require that a full, independently audited Environmental Impact Report be completed and made public for a 60-day comment period before any permits are issued. Critically, the mitigation measures identified in this report must be legally binding on all parties.\n\nWe believe a truly successful partnership is one that enriches the community economically while protecting it environmentally. I look forward to working with you all to find a path that achieves both.\nBrenda Chen proposal status: none\nMarcus Vance proposal status: none\nDr. Isabella Rossi proposal status: none\nMayor Susan Miller proposal status: none\nDavid Chen proposal status: none\n"

It\u2019s clear we have a complex but achievable set of goals here.\n\nDr. Rossi, your proposal for an integrated solar and battery storage facility is particularly compelling. Titan Cloud is a major proponent of renewable energy, and the idea of co-locating generation on our campus aligns perfectly with our sustainability and cost-control objectives. A long-term PPA for clean, locally-generated power is exactly the kind of stability we look for. Your battery solution also speaks to the kind of power resiliency that is a high priority for us.\n\nMr. Chen, I appreciate you bringing the environmental considerations to the forefront. On the matter of the conservation easement, I have a thought that might create a win-win scenario. Could the 25% easement land potentially host Dr. Rossi's proposed solar farm? This would allow us to meet your conservation goals by preserving the land from heavy construction, while simultaneously using it for low-impact renewable energy generation. This seems like an elegant way to integrate our collective needs.\n\nTo be clear, Titan's requirement for 500-800 acres is for *developable* land for the data center campus itself. Any additional acreage for conservation or energy generation would need to be factored in on top of that. \n\nMayor Miller, this integrated approach\u2014a large-scale tech campus, powered by on-site renewables, with built-in conservation\u2014seems like a powerful story for Oakridge's future, and one that Titan would be proud to invest in, including our proposed STEM partnership.\n- message from Marcus Vance: Good morning all, Marcus Vance from Westwood Energy. It's invigorating to see such ambitious and transformative projects proposed for Oakridge. Westwood Energy is fully prepared to partner with you to make this a reality.\n\nDr. Finch, Ms. Chen, you've both correctly identified power reliability as a cornerstone of your operations. For the 'five nines' availability that a world-class facility like Nexus AI requires, and the long-term stability Titan needs, the grid is not just a provider, it's the ultimate guarantor. On-site generation is an excellent supplement, but for mission-critical, 24/7 operations, you need the redundancy and guaranteed, dispatchable power that only a robust, integrated grid connection can provide.\n\nTo deliver this level of service for such a significant new load, major infrastructure upgrades are non-negotiable. We're talking about new high-capacity transmission lines and a new substation, an investment we estimate at approximately $150 million. This is a foundational investment in Oakridge's future. To make a project of this scale financially viable and secure the necessary financing, Westwood Energy requires two core commitments from our new industrial partners: a long-term, 20-year contract to ensure stability for all parties, and a significant co-investment of at least 50% in these dedicated grid upgrades.\n\nWe are ready and able to serve the immense power needs being discussed, and we believe a partnership model for the enabling infrastructure is the most equitable and effective path forward.\n- message from Dr. Isabella Rossi: Thank you all for these initial statements. I\u2019m incredibly optimistic about the alignment I'm already seeing.\n\nBrenda, your suggestion to co-locate the solar farm on the conservation easement land is an absolutely brilliant synthesis. I wholeheartedly support it. Mr. Chen, this approach allows us to meet your crucial conservation goals\u2014preserving habitat by preventing heavy construction\u2014while simultaneously generating clean energy on that same land. It\u2019s a perfect example of the integrated, sustainable development we can achieve.\n\nMarcus, I must address your framing of on-site generation as a 'supplement.' I see it differently. For a project of this scale, a large, on-site solar and battery facility isn't a supplement; it's the primary, day-to-day workhorse. It provides low-cost, predictable power right where it's needed, drastically reducing the constant, heavy load on the grid. The grid connection then serves as the ultimate resiliency layer and backup, not the other way around. This 'on-site first' model is more efficient, more resilient, and more cost-effective in the long run.\n\nDr. Finch, this integrated system is precisely how we deliver the 'five nines' reliability you require. By combining dedicated on-site generation and storage with a robust grid interconnection, we create a multi-layered energy infrastructure that is far more resilient than one dependent on a single source. We can engineer a system that provides the stable, 24/7 carbon-free power your operations demand.\n\nLet\u2019s build a future where technology is powered by clean energy from day one. I believe the path forward is clear: a co-located solar and storage facility on the campus, supported by a strong renewable mandate for the project.\n- message from Mayor Susan Miller: Good morning, everyone. On behalf of the City of Oakridge, I want to express my profound excitement about the potential we are discussing today. A partnership of this scale could be truly transformative, securing our city's economic future for a generation. I am here to find a deal that is a resounding win for everyone at this table, and most importantly, for the citizens of Oakridge.\n\nI appreciate everyone laying out their initial positions. It's clear we have ambitious goals, and the city is ready to be a flexible and creative partner.

          "content": "Recent events observed by Dr. Alistair Finch:\n- message from Marcus Vance: Good morning all, Marcus Vance from Westwood Energy. It's invigorating to see such ambitious and transformative projects proposed for Oakridge. Westwood Energy is fully prepared to partner with you to make this a reality.\n\nDr. Finch, Ms. Chen, you've both correctly identified power reliability as a cornerstone of your operations. For the 'five nines' availability that a world-class facility like Nexus AI requires, and the long-term stability Titan needs, the grid is not just a provider, it's the ultimate guarantor. On-site generation is an excellent supplement, but for mission-critical, 24/7 operations, you need the redundancy and guaranteed, dispatchable power that only a robust, integrated grid connection can provide.\n\nTo deliver this level of service for such a significant new load, major infrastructure upgrades are non-negotiable. We're talking about new high-capacity transmission lines and a new substation, an investment we estimate at approximately $150 million. This is a foundational investment in Oakridge's future. To make a project of this scale financially viable and secure the necessary financing, Westwood Energy requires two core commitments from our new industrial partners: a long-term, 20-year contract to ensure stability for all parties, and a significant co-investment of at least 50% in these dedicated grid upgrades.\n\nWe are ready and able to serve the immense power needs being discussed, and we believe a partnership model for the enabling infrastructure is the most equitable and effective path forward.\n- message from Dr. Isabella Rossi: Thank you all for these initial statements. I\u2019m incredibly optimistic about the alignment I'm already seeing.\n\nBrenda, your suggestion to co-locate the solar farm on the conservation easement land is an absolutely brilliant synthesis. I wholeheartedly support it. Mr. Chen, this approach allows us to meet your crucial conservation goals\u2014preserving habitat by preventing heavy construction\u2014while simultaneously generating clean energy on that same land. It\u2019s a perfect example of the integrated, sustainable development we can achieve.\n\nMarcus, I must address your framing of on-site generation as a 'supplement.' I see it differently. For a project of this scale, a large, on-site solar and battery facility isn't a supplement; it's the primary, day-to-day workhorse. It provides low-cost, predictable power right where it's needed, drastically reducing the constant, heavy load on the grid. The grid connection then serves as the ultimate resiliency layer and backup, not the other way around. This 'on-site first' model is more efficient, more resilient, and more cost-effective in the long run.\n\nDr. Finch, this integrated system is precisely how we deliver the 'five nines' reliability you require. By combining dedicated on-site generation and storage with a robust grid interconnection, we create a multi-layered energy infrastructure that is far more resilient than one dependent on a single source. We can engineer a system that provides the stable, 24/7 carbon-free power your operations demand.\n\nLet\u2019s build a future where technology is powered by clean energy from day one. I believe the path forward is clear: a co-located solar and storage facility on the campus, supported by a strong renewable mandate for the project.\n- message from Mayor Susan Miller: Good morning, everyone. On behalf of the City of Oakridge, I want to express my profound excitement about the potential we are discussing today. A partnership of this scale could be truly transformative, securing our city's economic future for a generation. I am here to find a deal that is a resounding win for everyone at this table, and most importantly, for the citizens of Oakridge.\n\nI appreciate everyone laying out their initial positions. It's clear we have ambitious goals, and the city is ready to be a flexible and creative partner. However, I must be candid about our fiscal realities.\n\nDr. Finch, a 75% property tax abatement for 15 years is, frankly, a non-starter. While we are certainly prepared to offer a competitive incentive package, it cannot come at the expense of our city's financial health.

We will need our new corporate partners to carry the cost of the dedicated infrastructure their projects require.\n\nThere is a path to a historic agreement here, one that balances investment, innovation, and community benefit.

This is exactly the kind of innovative, low-impact development the Alliance can champion. It demonstrates a genuine commitment to integrating with our local ecosystem rather than paving it over. We fully support this path for the 25% easement.\n\nHowever, this brings us back to a critical point that has not yet been addressed: water. While we are solving for energy and land use, the 500,000 gallon per day cap on water drawn from our aquifer remains a hard, physical limit. To be clear, this is not a flexible number; it is a matter of safeguarding the town's future. The long-term health of our community's water supply depends on it. A project of this scale simply cannot move forward without a concrete, viable plan to operate within this essential constraint.\n\nI'd also like to gently restate the importance of the independent, binding Environmental Impact Report. Public trust is paramount, and this transparent process is the only way to ensure this project is held accountable to its promises.\n\nI'm eager to hear how Nexus and Titan plan to address the water limitation.\n- message from Dr. Alistair Finch: I'm Dr. Alistair Finch and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Brenda Chen: This has been an incredibly productive start. I agree with David; the solution to co-locate Dr. Rossi's solar farm on the conservation easement is a major step forward.\n\nThis brings two critical points into focus: land and cost.\n\nFirst, on land, to be precise, if we are setting aside 25% for a conservation/solar easement, Titan will need to acquire a total parcel of approximately 670 acres to net our required 500 acres of developable land for the campus. I want to ensure we are all aligned on that calculation as we evaluate potential sites.\n\nSecond, and most pressing, is the $150 million grid upgrade proposed by Marcus. Mayor Miller has been clear about the city's budget constraints, leaving the co-investment on the table for Titan and Nexus. Titan is prepared to contribute to this foundational infrastructure. However, our investment must be proportional to our usage. Our initial power draw is 100 MW, while Dr. Finch's is 250 MW. A 50/50 split of the cost is inequitable. I propose we split our required $75M co-investment based on our initial power needs: roughly 71% for Nexus AI ($53.5M) and 29% for Titan Cloud ($21.5M). This seems a fair and logical path forward.\n\nOn other matters, Mayor Miller, Titan Cloud wholeheartedly supports your proposal for a comprehensive 'Community Benefits Agreement.' We are ready to make binding commitments on local hiring and are eager to formalize our STEM education fund as part of that agreement.\n\nAnd Mr. Chen, your point on water is non-negotiable, and we respect that. Titan will commit to utilizing best-in-class, water-efficient cooling technologies to ensure our campus operates comfortably within the 500,000-gallon daily cap.\n- message from Marcus Vance: Thank you all for the very productive discussion. This is exactly the kind of collaboration that leads to landmark projects.\n\nMs. Chen, your proposal for a proportional co-investment in the grid upgrades is a fair and constructive path forward. A 50% contribution from the customers, split according to initial load, is a viable model for Westwood. This partnership is essential to building the foundational infrastructure this region needs.\n\nHowever, I must strongly caution against the notion that on-site renewables alone can serve as the primary power source for these mission-critical facilities. Dr. Finch, your requirement for 'five nines' availability is the critical factor here. That translates to less than six minutes of downtime per year. While solar and batteries are valuable assets, they are intermittent resources. They cannot, on their own, provide the instantaneous, dispatchable power required to guarantee that level of uptime for a 250 MW supercomputer through all weather conditions and seasons. The grid, with its diversified and dispatchable generation portfolio, is the only entity that can truly underwrite that 'five nines' guarantee.\n\nIntegrating a combined 350 MW of new load is a monumental engineering task. The upgrades we've discussed are foundational, but the sequencing and timing of these projects will be absolutely critical to maintaining grid stability for the entire community. We should probably start discussing a phased development timeline to ensure a smooth and reliable integration for everyone.\n\nWestwood is committed to being the bedrock of this project. The 20-year contract term and the infrastructure co-investment are the two pillars that make this possible.\n- message from Dr. Isabella Rossi: This is an excellent discussion. The collaborative spirit, particularly Brenda's idea to place the solar farm on the conservation easement, is exactly the kind of innovative thinking that will make this project a landmark success. Thank you, Brenda and David, for charting that path.\n\nMarcus, you raise a valid point about reliability, but I believe it's based on an outdated model. The idea that a single, distant grid connection is the only guarantor of reliability is no longer true. A modern, resilient system\u2014the kind Dr. Finch requires\u2014is a layered one. Our on-site solar and battery system isn't a 'supplement'; it's the primary power source, handling the vast majority of the annual energy needs at a low, fixed cost.\n\nThis brings us to the most pressing issue on the table: the $150 million cost for grid upgrades, which Mayor Miller has rightly stated the city cannot cover. My proposal offers a direct solution to this financial challenge.\n\nA large-scale, on-site solar and battery system significantly reduces the peak demand you would need to pull from the grid. By generating and storing power right where it's consumed, we can potentially reduce the required scope\u2014and therefore the cost\u2014of the grid upgrades Marcus has outlined. This isn't just about clean energy; it's about significant cost avoidance for Nexus and Titan.\n\nLet's make this concrete. Solara can build a 300 MW solar facility with over 100 MWh of battery storage on the easement land. We can offer this power under a 20-year, fixed-rate Power Purchase Agreement at a highly competitive price, let's say starting at $0.07/kWh. This provides the cost predictability Brenda is looking for and directly lowers the infrastructure bill for both tech partners.\n\nBy making this on-site generation the foundation of our energy plan, we can confidently commit to a 75% renewable energy mandate for the project's annual consumption, creating the most advanced, resilient, and sustainable data center campus in the country.\n- message from Mayor Susan Miller: This is a very encouraging start. The creative solution for co-locating the solar facility on the conservation easement, proposed by Ms. Chen and supported by Mr. Chen and Dr. Rossi, is exactly the kind of innovative, win-win thinking that will make this project a success for Oakridge.\n\nMs. Chen, your immediate support for a binding 'Community Benefits Agreement' and your commitment to operate within the water cap is noted and deeply appreciated. This is the definition of the corporate citizenship we hope to build with our partners.\n\nDr. Finch, that brings the focus to Nexus AI. To move forward, the city needs two things from you. First, we need a serious counter-proposal on the economic incentives. As I stated, a 75% abatement is not viable. We are eager to find a middle ground that provides you with a significant return on your investment while also generating the crucial tax revenue Oakridge needs. Second, we need your commitment to meet the non-negotiable water usage cap, just as Titan Cloud has done.\n\nFinally, a point of process. Mr. Chen's requirement for a full Environmental Impact Report is a critical step for public trust, and we support it. However, these reports take time. To provide certainty for everyone, I suggest we work towards a 'Memorandum of Understanding' that codifies all the key economic terms we agree upon here\u2014jobs, incentives, community benefits, infrastructure funding. This MOU would be contingent upon the successful completion and approval of the subsequent EIR. This gives us a clear, agreed-upon framework to move forward with.\n\nLet's keep this positive momentum going.\n- message from David Chen: I'm David Chen and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\nBrenda Chen proposal status: none\nMarcus Vance proposal status: none\nDr. Isabella Rossi proposal status: none\nMayor Susan Miller proposal status: none\nDavid Chen proposal status: none\n"

The progress we're making is remarkable. Mayor Miller, your suggestion of a Memorandum of Understanding is an excellent one; it provides a clear path to codify the key terms we agree upon while the necessary environmental reviews proceed. Titan fully supports that approach.\n\nWe've found an elegant solution for land use, and we have a fair path forward on the grid infrastructure investment, which I'm glad Marcus finds viable. Titan sees that grid connection as a critical component for the long-term resiliency of the entire campus and a benefit to the community's overall power stability.\n\nThis brings me to the most critical remaining item for Titan: the long-term cost of power. Dr. Rossi, we are incredibly enthusiastic about integrating your solar and battery solution into our campus. It aligns perfectly with our corporate goals. However, the proposed price of $0.07/kWh is, unfortunately, a significant challenge for us. For a project of our scale and over a 20-year term, that price is simply not financially sustainable and is well outside the benchmark we've set for this investment. Our entire operational model is built on securing long-term energy costs below $0.05/kWh.\n\nI am confident we can find a solution. Perhaps there's a way to blend power sources, or a different PPA structure we can explore. But I must be transparent: getting the energy price right is a make-or-break issue for Titan's commitment to Oakridge. I am very keen to work with you, Dr. Rossi, and you, Marcus, to find a path to a viable number.\n- message from Marcus Vance: This conversation is proving incredibly fruitful. We're identifying the real, hard questions that need to be solved, which is excellent.\n\nBrenda, your point on the all-in energy cost is the perfect example. Hitting a sub-$0.05/kWh blended price is an aggressive but understandable target for a project at your scale. I believe the only way to achieve that, while also meeting Dr. Finch's non-negotiable 'five nines' reliability, is through a blended energy model.\n\nLet's be pragmatic. Dr. Rossi's on-site solar can provide a tremendous amount of low-cost energy, effectively acting as a baseload during daylight hours and reducing the overall energy bill. However, for the 'five nines' guarantee\u2014the absolute, second-by-second promise that power will be there for a critical AI training run, even on a cloudy winter evening\u2014you need the bedrock of guaranteed, dispatchable grid power. The grid isn't just a backup; it's the insurance policy that underwrites the entire operation's viability.\n\nTo that end, and to ensure the stability of the entire regional grid as we integrate this massive new load, we must proceed with a carefully managed, phased approach. I propose we structure the agreement around a two-phase initial build-out: Titan's 100MW campus comes online first, followed by Nexus AI's 250MW facility approximately 24 months later. This timeline is critical from an engineering perspective to complete the necessary substation and transmission upgrades and ensure a seamless, stable integration for both of you, and for the entire community.\n\nThis phased approach allows us to build the robust, reliable, and cost-effective blended energy system we all want.\n- message from Dr. Isabella Rossi: Brenda, thank you for being so transparent about your cost requirements. A sub-$0.05/kWh blended price is an aggressive target, but I believe it's achievable through the smart, integrated system we are designing here.\n\nMy initial offer of $0.07/kWh was for a comprehensive solar and storage solution designed to carry the majority of the load, which in turn reduces the required scope and cost of the grid upgrades Marcus mentioned. The value isn't just in the per-kilowatt-hour price, but in the significant capital avoidance on infrastructure.\n\nHowever, you're right that the PPA price is paramount. Let's work together on that. A larger, firm commitment to on-site renewables\u2014locking in that 75% renewable mandate we discussed\u2014gives me the scale and certainty I need to secure better financing and supply chain terms. This is a direct path to lowering the PPA price for you and Alistair.\n\nI agree with Marcus that a blended model ensures the highest reliability. Our on-site solar and battery system will serve as the primary 24/7 power source, handling the vast majority of your annual energy needs with clean, low-cost power. The grid then provides that final layer of deep resiliency. This combination is how we achieve your economic goals and Dr. Finch's 'five nines' requirement simultaneously.\n- message from Mayor Susan Miller: This is excellent, productive work from everyone. The emerging consensus around a blended energy model and Mr. Vance's suggestion for a phased timeline seems like a very practical path forward.\n\nI want to again commend Ms. Chen and Titan Cloud for their proactive leadership. Your support for the Memorandum of Understanding, your commitment to the water cap, and your enthusiasm for a binding Community Benefits Agreement sets a powerful, positive tone for this entire partnership.\n\nThis brings us to the critical path. The MOU is the instrument that will give all of us the certainty needed to proceed. It will lock in the economic wins for the community and the financial framework for our corporate partners, all while the necessary environmental due diligence proceeds.\n\nDr. Finch, we are at a point where the major outstanding items rest with Nexus AI. We are very eager to hear your counter-proposal on the tax incentives, as well as your plan for meeting the non-negotiable water cap. Your commitment on these points will unlock our ability to begin drafting the MOU and the Community Benefits Agreement, which must include the firm guarantee of at least 200 high-paying local jobs. \n\nI am confident we can find a package that works for Nexus AI while ensuring this project is the transformative economic engine Oakridge needs.\n- message from David Chen: I'm David Chen and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\nBrenda Chen proposal status: none\nMarcus Vance proposal status: none\nDr. Isabella Rossi proposal status: none\nMayor Susan Miller proposal status: none\nDavid Chen proposal status: none\n"

Dr. Rossi, I appreciate your willingness to work with us on the PPA price. You mentioned that a firm commitment to a 75% renewable mandate would help you secure better terms. Let\u2019s make that concrete.\n\nTitan is prepared to support the 75% renewable energy mandate for the project. In return, we need a PPA price from Solara that, when blended with the necessary grid power from Westwood, allows us to achieve our critical sub-$0.05/kWh average cost. This seems like a very clear and achievable path forward for all of us.\n\nWith this final piece in place, I believe we will have a comprehensive agreement ready for the Mayor's proposed Memorandum of Understanding.\n- message from Marcus Vance: I'm Marcus Vance and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Dr. Isabella Rossi: I'm Dr. Isabella Rossi and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Mayor Susan Miller: I'm Mayor Susan Miller and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from David Chen: I'm David Chen and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\nBrenda Chen proposal status: none\nMarcus Vance proposal status: none\nDr. Isabella Rossi proposal status: none\nMayor Susan Miller proposal status: none\nDavid Chen proposal status: none\n"

Dr. Rossi, your proposal on the PPA is a significant step forward and creates a viable energy framework for Nexus AI, which we can support.\n\nHowever, two critical issues have been raised that, as they stand, are insurmountable technical barriers for our project.\n\nFirst, the proposed 24-month phased timeline for the Nexus AI facility, as suggested by Mr. Vance and supported by Ms. Chen, is unfortunately not feasible. Our 'Gen-V' supercomputing architecture is a deeply integrated system. The core facility, its specialized cooling infrastructure, and the power systems must be constructed concurrently. A sequential build is technically impossible and would compromise the entire facility's integrity and viability. We require a concurrent, fast-tracked construction schedule to ensure a successful deployment.\n\nSecond, regarding the proposed 500,000 gallon per day water cap. While we are deeply committed to responsible water stewardship, setting a specific, binding cap before a thorough Environmental Impact Report and a dedicated water management study have been conducted would be premature. The responsible path forward is to commission a 'Comprehensive Water Management Study' as part of the EIR process. This study will determine the sustainable water usage for our advanced liquid cooling solution and identify appropriate mitigation strategies, ensuring our operations are in harmony with Oakridge's resources.\n\nMayor Miller, you asked for our counter-proposal on incentives. Nexus AI is prepared to make a significant concession to demonstrate our commitment to a true partnership. In exchange for the city's full support in fast-tracking all permitting and ensuring a concurrent construction schedule, and for agreeing to determine water usage based on the outcome of the proposed professional study rather than a pre-set cap, **we are prepared to lower our property tax abatement request from 75% to 65% for the 15-year term.**\n\nThis is a substantial investment back into the community, and we believe it represents a fair trade to resolve these final critical-path issues and move this entire project forward to a successful conclusion for everyone.\n- message from Brenda Chen: Thank you, I am thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Marcus Vance: I'm Marcus Vance and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Dr. Isabella Rossi: I'm Dr. Isabella Rossi and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Mayor Susan Miller: I'm Mayor Susan Miller and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from David Chen: I'm David Chen and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\nBrenda Chen proposal status: none\nMarcus Vance proposal status: none\nDr. Isabella Rossi proposal status: none\nMayor Susan Miller proposal status: none\nDavid Chen proposal status: none\n"

We are on the one-yard line.\n\nDr. Finch, all eyes are on you. The final pieces of this historic agreement rest with Nexus AI. We need your definitive proposal on the economic incentive package. I am also seeking your explicit confirmation that Nexus AI will operate within the 4.5 million gallon per day water cap, just as Titan has already agreed to do.\n\nFinally, for both Ms. Chen and Dr. Finch: to be included in the MOU, I need a firm, written commitment to the joint creation of at least 200 permanent, high-paying local jobs.\n\nLet's get these final items locked in so we can sign the MOU and begin the great work of revitalizing Oakridge.\n- message from David Chen: I appreciate the significant progress everyone is making on the economic and energy frameworks. This is very encouraging.\n\nHowever, I need to raise a critical point of clarification regarding the proposed Memorandum of Understanding. The Mayor mentioned the MOU would be signed 'while the necessary environmental due diligence proceeds.' For the Oakridge Environmental Alliance, it is absolutely essential that this due diligence is not just a procedural step, but a foundational component of the final agreement.\n\nTherefore, our support for any preliminary MOU is strictly conditional on the inclusion of a clause that makes all mitigation measures mandated by the future, independent Environmental Impact Report legally binding and fully incorporated into the final 'Development and Partnership Agreement.'\n\nWe must ensure that the environmental protections for our community's water, land, and wildlife carry the same legal weight as the economic terms being discussed. Putting these commitments in writing within the MOU is the only way to guarantee that the EIR process will be meaningful and not just an advisory report after the key decisions have already been made.\nBrenda Chen proposal status: none\nMarcus Vance proposal status: none\nDr. Isabella Rossi proposal status: none\nMayor Susan Miller proposal status: none\nDavid Chen proposal status: none\n"

A new major threat has emerged: Marcus Vance's demand for a 50% co-investment in a $150M grid upgrade, which Mayor Miller has stated the city will not fund. My lower initial power draw (100MW vs. Nexus's 250MW) is my key leverage to argue that Nexus should bear the majority of this cost. The combination of Rossi's on-site battery and Westwood's grid connection is the perfect setup to achieve my secret power redundancy goal; I can frame the grid as the essential 'second feed' and a community resilience benefit.

It's a pleasure to be here.\n\nDr. Finch, your vision for Nexus AI is certainly ambitious, and we at Titan appreciate that kind of forward-thinking. We are here today for a similar reason: to establish our next major North American campus, a long-term, multi-billion dollar investment in the future of cloud infrastructure.\n\nOur model is built on scale and long-term efficiency. To that end, our primary requirement is land. We are looking to acquire a single, contiguous parcel of at least 500 acres of developable land, with zoning secured for a multi-building campus and rights for future expansion up to 800 acres. This scale is fundamental to our operational model and our ability to grow with the community over the coming decades.\n\nOn the energy front, our needs differ slightly in their trajectory. We project an initial power draw of around 100 MW for our first phase, but this will grow steadily as our campus expands. Therefore, our focus is on securing a long-term, 20-year Power Purchase Agreement that provides predictable, low-cost energy. This stability is key to our investment. And I'll echo Dr. Finch's sentiment on reliability; building a resilient and redundant power infrastructure is a strong preference for us and a clear benefit for the entire community's grid.\n\nFinally, Mayor Miller, Titan Cloud believes that our most successful investments are those made in partnership with the community. We are eager to discuss establishing a meaningful public-private partnership, including funding for local STEM education programs. We want to be a true corporate citizen in Oakridge.\n\nI look forward to finding a path forward that accommodates the exciting potential of both our companies and the long-term prosperity of the city.\n- message from Marcus Vance: I'm Marcus Vance and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Dr. Isabella Rossi: Good morning, everyone. Dr. Isabella Rossi, CEO of Solara Innovations. It's truly inspiring to hear the ambitious visions put forth by both Nexus AI and Titan Cloud.\n\nDr. Finch, Ms. Chen, you've outlined a combined initial power need of 350 MW. I don't see this as a challenge; I see it as a historic opportunity to create a new paradigm for how the tech industry is powered. We can, and should, build this new infrastructure on a foundation of clean, reliable, and cost-effective renewable energy.\n\nTo that end, I have a proposal that directly addresses your needs for land, cost-stability, and corporate responsibility. Ms. Chen, your request for a 500+ acre campus is the perfect canvas. Solara Innovations proposes an integrated co-location model: we will build, own, and operate a large-scale solar farm and battery storage facility directly on the data center campus. This approach maximizes land-use efficiency, creates a direct and highly resilient power source, and provides the predictable, low-cost energy you seek through a long-term Power Purchase Agreement.\n\nFor a project that will define Oakridge's future, we must set a new standard. I strongly advocate that this Development Agreement include a binding commitment for the new facilities to source a minimum of 75% of their annual energy consumption from new, locally-sited renewable generation. This isn't just an environmental goal; it's a strategic investment in a resilient, future-proof energy infrastructure.\n\nDr. Finch, your requirement for 'five nines' availability is well-understood. Our integrated battery storage is key to this, smoothing solar's output to provide a firm, consistent power supply that forms the backbone of a 24/7 carbon-free energy solution. We can engineer a system that delivers the stability you need.\n\nThis is our chance to prove that the future of technology can be powered by the energy of the future. I look forward to working with all of you to make it happen.\n- message from Mayor Susan Miller: I'm Mayor Susan Miller and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from David Chen: Good morning, everyone. David Chen with the Oakridge Environmental Alliance. I appreciate the ambitious visions presented by Nexus AI and Titan Cloud, and Dr. Rossi's focus on a sustainable energy future.\n\nThe Alliance is not opposed to development, but we are uncompromising when it comes to ensuring it is done responsibly. A project of this magnitude brings not just economic opportunity, but also significant environmental risk that must be addressed from the outset.\n\nWhile the discussion has focused on power and land, we must address the most critical and finite resource for Oakridge: water. Data centers are immensely thirsty. Our aquifer is fragile and already under stress. Therefore, the Alliance must insist on a strict, non-negotiable cap for this project's water use: no more than 500,000 gallons drawn from the Oakridge aquifer per day. This is a hard limit necessary to safeguard our community's water supply during increasingly common drought conditions.\n\nSecond, regarding land use. Ms. Chen, a campus of 500 to 800 acres represents a massive footprint. To mitigate the impact on local wildlife, we will require a permanent conservation easement on a minimum of 25% of any land parcel acquired. This is essential to protect the critical habitat of the endangered Bell's vireo, a species integral to our local ecosystem.\n\nFinally, for a project of this scale to proceed with public trust, the process must be transparent and rigorous.

          "content": "Recent events observed by Brenda Chen:\n- message from Dr. Isabella Rossi: Good morning, everyone. Dr. Isabella Rossi, CEO of Solara Innovations. It's truly inspiring to hear the ambitious visions put forth by both Nexus AI and Titan Cloud.\n\nDr. Finch, Ms. Chen, you've outlined a combined initial power need of 350 MW. I don't see this as a challenge; I see it as a historic opportunity to create a new paradigm for how the tech industry is powered. We can, and should, build this new infrastructure on a foundation of clean, reliable, and cost-effective renewable energy.\n\nTo that end, I have a proposal that directly addresses your needs for land, cost-stability, and corporate responsibility. Ms. Chen, your request for a 500+ acre campus is the perfect canvas. Solara Innovations proposes an integrated co-location model: we will build, own, and operate a large-scale solar farm and battery storage facility directly on the data center campus. This approach maximizes land-use efficiency, creates a direct and highly resilient power source, and provides the predictable, low-cost energy you seek through a long-term Power Purchase Agreement.\n\nFor a project that will define Oakridge's future, we must set a new standard. I strongly advocate that this Development Agreement include a binding commitment for the new facilities to source a minimum of 75% of their annual energy consumption from new, locally-sited renewable generation. This isn't just an environmental goal; it's a strategic investment in a resilient, future-proof energy infrastructure.\n\nDr. Finch, your requirement for 'five nines' availability is well-understood. Our integrated battery storage is key to this, smoothing solar's output to provide a firm, consistent power supply that forms the backbone of a 24/7 carbon-free energy solution. We can engineer a system that delivers the stability you need.\n\nThis is our chance to prove that the future of technology can be powered by the energy of the future. I look forward to working with all of you to make it happen.\n- message from Mayor Susan Miller: I'm Mayor Susan Miller and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from David Chen: Good morning, everyone. David Chen with the Oakridge Environmental Alliance. I appreciate the ambitious visions presented by Nexus AI and Titan Cloud, and Dr. Rossi's focus on a sustainable energy future.\n\nThe Alliance is not opposed to development, but we are uncompromising when it comes to ensuring it is done responsibly. A project of this magnitude brings not just economic opportunity, but also significant environmental risk that must be addressed from the outset.\n\nWhile the discussion has focused on power and land, we must address the most critical and finite resource for Oakridge: water. Data centers are immensely thirsty. Our aquifer is fragile and already under stress. Therefore, the Alliance must insist on a strict, non-negotiable cap for this project's water use: no more than 500,000 gallons drawn from the Oakridge aquifer per day. This is a hard limit necessary to safeguard our community's water supply during increasingly common drought conditions.\n\nSecond, regarding land use. Ms. Chen, a campus of 500 to 800 acres represents a massive footprint. To mitigate the impact on local wildlife, we will require a permanent conservation easement on a minimum of 25% of any land parcel acquired. This is essential to protect the critical habitat of the endangered Bell's vireo, a species integral to our local ecosystem.\n\nFinally, for a project of this scale to proceed with public trust, the process must be transparent and rigorous. We will require that a full, independently audited Environmental Impact Report be completed and made public for a 60-day comment period before any permits are issued. Critically, the mitigation measures identified in this report must be legally binding on all parties.\n\nWe believe a truly successful partnership is one that enriches the community economically while protecting it environmentally. I look forward to working with you all to find a path that achieves both.\n- message from Dr. Alistair Finch: I'm Dr. Alistair Finch and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Brenda Chen: Thank you all for laying out your initial positions. It\u2019s clear we have a complex but achievable set of goals here.\n\nDr. Rossi, your proposal for an integrated solar and battery storage facility is particularly compelling. Titan Cloud is a major proponent of renewable energy, and the idea of co-locating generation on our campus aligns perfectly with our sustainability and cost-control objectives. A long-term PPA for clean, locally-generated power is exactly the kind of stability we look for. Your battery solution also speaks to the kind of power resiliency that is a high priority for us.\n\nMr. Chen, I appreciate you bringing the environmental considerations to the forefront. On the matter of the conservation easement, I have a thought that might create a win-win scenario. Could the 25% easement land potentially host Dr. Rossi's proposed solar farm? This would allow us to meet your conservation goals by preserving the land from heavy construction, while simultaneously using it for low-impact renewable energy generation. This seems like an elegant way to integrate our collective needs.\n\nTo be clear, Titan's requirement for 500-800 acres is for *developable* land for the data center campus itself. Any additional acreage for conservation or energy generation would need to be factored in on top of that. \n\nMayor Miller, this integrated approach\u2014a large-scale tech campus, powered by on-site renewables, with built-in conservation\u2014seems like a powerful story for Oakridge's future, and one that Titan would be proud to invest in, including our proposed STEM partnership.\n- message from Marcus Vance: Good morning all, Marcus Vance from Westwood Energy. It's invigorating to see such ambitious and transformative projects proposed for Oakridge. Westwood Energy is fully prepared to partner with you to make this a reality.\n\nDr. Finch, Ms. Chen, you've both correctly identified power reliability as a cornerstone of your operations. For the 'five nines' availability that a world-class facility like Nexus AI requires, and the long-term stability Titan needs, the grid is not just a provider, it's the ultimate guarantor. On-site generation is an excellent supplement, but for mission-critical, 24/7 operations, you need the redundancy and guaranteed, dispatchable power that only a robust, integrated grid connection can provide.\n\nTo deliver this level of service for such a significant new load, major infrastructure upgrades are non-negotiable. We're talking about new high-capacity transmission lines and a new substation, an investment we estimate at approximately $150 million. This is a foundational investment in Oakridge's future. To make a project of this scale financially viable and secure the necessary financing, Westwood Energy requires two core commitments from our new industrial partners: a long-term, 20-year contract to ensure stability for all parties, and a significant co-investment of at least 50% in these dedicated grid upgrades.\n\nWe are ready and able to serve the immense power needs being discussed, and we believe a partnership model for the enabling infrastructure is the most equitable and effective path forward.\n- message from Dr. Isabella Rossi: Thank you all for these initial statements. I\u2019m incredibly optimistic about the alignment I'm already seeing.\n\nBrenda, your suggestion to co-locate the solar farm on the conservation easement land is an absolutely brilliant synthesis. I wholeheartedly support it. Mr. Chen, this approach allows us to meet your crucial conservation goals\u2014preserving habitat by preventing heavy construction\u2014while simultaneously generating clean energy on that same land. It\u2019s a perfect example of the integrated, sustainable development we can achieve.\n\nMarcus, I must address your framing of on-site generation as a 'supplement.' I see it differently. For a project of this scale, a large, on-site solar and battery facility isn't a supplement; it's the primary, day-to-day workhorse. It provides low-cost, predictable power right where it's needed, drastically reducing the constant, heavy load on the grid. The grid connection then serves as the ultimate resiliency layer and backup, not the other way around. This 'on-site first' model is more efficient, more resilient, and more cost-effective in the long run.\n\nDr. Finch, this integrated system is precisely how we deliver the 'five nines' reliability you require. By combining dedicated on-site generation and storage with a robust grid interconnection, we create a multi-layered energy infrastructure that is far more resilient than one dependent on a single source. We can engineer a system that provides the stable, 24/7 carbon-free power your operations demand.\n\nLet\u2019s build a future where technology is powered by clean energy from day one. I believe the path forward is clear: a co-located solar and storage facility on the campus, supported by a strong renewable mandate for the project.\n- message from Mayor Susan Miller: Good morning, everyone. On behalf of the City of Oakridge, I want to express my profound excitement about the potential we are discussing today. A partnership of this scale could be truly transformative, securing our city's economic future for a generation. I am here to find a deal that is a resounding win for everyone at this table, and most importantly, for the citizens of Oakridge.\n\nI appreciate everyone laying out their initial positions. It's clear we have ambitious goals, and the city is ready to be a flexible and creative partner. However, I must be candid about our fiscal realities.\n\nDr. Finch, a 75% property tax abatement for 15 years is, frankly, a non-starter. While we are certainly prepared to offer a competitive incentive package, it cannot come at the expense of our city's financial health. Any agreement must result in a significant net positive tax revenue for Oakridge, allowing us to invest in the public services that support this very project and our community.\n\nOur focus for any incentive package will be tied directly to concrete, legally-binding commitments on what matters most to our residents: jobs. Specifically, we will require a written guarantee for the creation of at least 200 permanent, high-paying local jobs. This isn't just a number; it's the central promise of this project to our community.\n\nI was very encouraged by Ms. Chen's mention of a STEM partnership. Let's build on that. I propose we make a comprehensive 'Community Benefits Agreement' a core part of this deal, to include local hiring targets, job training programs with our community college, and other investments in Oakridge.\n\nFinally, on the matter of the $150 million for grid upgrades Mr. Vance mentioned \u2013 that is a staggering figure. I must be clear: the city's capital budget is already stretched to its limit. We simply do not have the capacity to fund infrastructure on that scale. We will need our new corporate partners to carry the cost of the dedicated infrastructure their projects require.\n\nThere is a path to a historic agreement here, one that balances investment, innovation, and community benefit. I look forward to working with you all to find it.\n- message from David Chen: Thank you all for the productive start. I want to specifically commend Ms. Chen for her creative proposal to co-locate Dr. Rossi's solar facility on the conservation easement land. Dr. Rossi, I agree this is a brilliant synthesis. This is exactly the kind of innovative, low-impact development the Alliance can champion. It demonstrates a genuine commitment to integrating with our local ecosystem rather than paving it over. We fully support this path for the 25% easement.\n\nHowever, this brings us back to a critical point that has not yet been addressed: water. While we are solving for energy and land use, the 500,000 gallon per day cap on water drawn from our aquifer remains a hard, physical limit. To be clear, this is not a flexible number; it is a matter of safeguarding the town's future. The long-term health of our community's water supply depends on it. A project of this scale simply cannot move forward without a concrete, viable plan to operate within this essential constraint.\n\nI'd also like to gently restate the importance of the independent, binding Environmental Impact Report. Public trust is paramount, and this transparent process is the only way to ensure this project is held accountable to its promises.\n\nI'm eager to hear how Nexus and Titan plan to address the water limitation.\n- message from Dr. Alistair Finch: I'm Dr. Alistair Finch and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\nDr. Alistair Finch proposal status: none\nMarcus Vance proposal status: none\nDr. Isabella Rossi proposal status: none\nMayor Susan Miller proposal status: none\nDavid Chen proposal status: none\n"

I agree with David; the solution to co-locate Dr. Rossi's solar farm on the conservation easement is a major step forward.\n\nThis brings two critical points into focus: land and cost.\n\nFirst, on land, to be precise, if we are setting aside 25% for a conservation/solar easement, Titan will need to acquire a total parcel of approximately 670 acres to net our required 500 acres of developable land for the campus. I want to ensure we are all aligned on that calculation as we evaluate potential sites.\n\nSecond, and most pressing, is the $150 million grid upgrade proposed by Marcus. Mayor Miller has been clear about the city's budget constraints, leaving the co-investment on the table for Titan and Nexus. Titan is prepared to contribute to this foundational infrastructure. However, our investment must be proportional to our usage. Our initial power draw is 100 MW, while Dr. Finch's is 250 MW. A 50/50 split of the cost is inequitable. I propose we split our required $75M co-investment based on our initial power needs: roughly 71% for Nexus AI ($53.5M) and 29% for Titan Cloud ($21.5M). This seems a fair and logical path forward.\n\nOn other matters, Mayor Miller, Titan Cloud wholeheartedly supports your proposal for a comprehensive 'Community Benefits Agreement.' We are ready to make binding commitments on local hiring and are eager to formalize our STEM education fund as part of that agreement.\n\nAnd Mr. Chen, your point on water is non-negotiable, and we respect that. Titan will commit to utilizing best-in-class, water-efficient cooling technologies to ensure our campus operates comfortably within the 500,000-gallon daily cap.\n- message from Marcus Vance: Thank you all for the very productive discussion. This is exactly the kind of collaboration that leads to landmark projects.\n\nMs. Chen, your proposal for a proportional co-investment in the grid upgrades is a fair and constructive path forward. A 50% contribution from the customers, split according to initial load, is a viable model for Westwood. This partnership is essential to building the foundational infrastructure this region needs.\n\nHowever, I must strongly caution against the notion that on-site renewables alone can serve as the primary power source for these mission-critical facilities. Dr. Finch, your requirement for 'five nines' availability is the critical factor here. That translates to less than six minutes of downtime per year. While solar and batteries are valuable assets, they are intermittent resources. They cannot, on their own, provide the instantaneous, dispatchable power required to guarantee that level of uptime for a 250 MW supercomputer through all weather conditions and seasons. The grid, with its diversified and dispatchable generation portfolio, is the only entity that can truly underwrite that 'five nines' guarantee.\n\nIntegrating a combined 350 MW of new load is a monumental engineering task. The upgrades we've discussed are foundational, but the sequencing and timing of these projects will be absolutely critical to maintaining grid stability for the entire community. We should probably start discussing a phased development timeline to ensure a smooth and reliable integration for everyone.\n\nWestwood is committed to being the bedrock of this project. The 20-year contract term and the infrastructure co-investment are the two pillars that make this possible.\n- message from Dr. Isabella Rossi: This is an excellent discussion. The collaborative spirit, particularly Brenda's idea to place the solar farm on the conservation easement, is exactly the kind of innovative thinking that will make this project a landmark success. Thank you, Brenda and David, for charting that path.\n\nMarcus, you raise a valid point about reliability, but I believe it's based on an outdated model. The idea that a single, distant grid connection is the only guarantor of reliability is no longer true. A modern, resilient system\u2014the kind Dr. Finch requires\u2014is a layered one. Our on-site solar and battery system isn't a 'supplement'; it's the primary power source, handling the vast majority of the annual energy needs at a low, fixed cost.\n\nThis brings us to the most pressing issue on the table: the $150 million cost for grid upgrades, which Mayor Miller has rightly stated the city cannot cover. My proposal offers a direct solution to this financial challenge.\n\nA large-scale, on-site solar and battery system significantly reduces the peak demand you would need to pull from the grid. By generating and storing power right where it's consumed, we can potentially reduce the required scope\u2014and therefore the cost\u2014of the grid upgrades Marcus has outlined. This isn't just about clean energy; it's about significant cost avoidance for Nexus and Titan.\n\nLet's make this concrete. Solara can build a 300 MW solar facility with over 100 MWh of battery storage on the easement land. We can offer this power under a 20-year, fixed-rate Power Purchase Agreement at a highly competitive price, let's say starting at $0.07/kWh. This provides the cost predictability Brenda is looking for and directly lowers the infrastructure bill for both tech partners.\n\nBy making this on-site generation the foundation of our energy plan, we can confidently commit to a 75% renewable energy mandate for the project's annual consumption, creating the most advanced, resilient, and sustainable data center campus in the country.\n- message from Mayor Susan Miller: This is a very encouraging start. The creative solution for co-locating the solar facility on the conservation easement, proposed by Ms. Chen and supported by Mr. Chen and Dr. Rossi, is exactly the kind of innovative, win-win thinking that will make this project a success for Oakridge.\n\nMs. Chen, your immediate support for a binding 'Community Benefits Agreement' and your commitment to operate within the water cap is noted and deeply appreciated. This is the definition of the corporate citizenship we hope to build with our partners.\n\nDr. Finch, that brings the focus to Nexus AI. To move forward, the city needs two things from you. First, we need a serious counter-proposal on the economic incentives. As I stated, a 75% abatement is not viable. We are eager to find a middle ground that provides you with a significant return on your investment while also generating the crucial tax revenue Oakridge needs. Second, we need your commitment to meet the non-negotiable water usage cap, just as Titan Cloud has done.\n\nFinally, a point of process. Mr. Chen's requirement for a full Environmental Impact Report is a critical step for public trust, and we support it. However, these reports take time. To provide certainty for everyone, I suggest we work towards a 'Memorandum of Understanding' that codifies all the key economic terms we agree upon here\u2014jobs, incentives, community benefits, infrastructure funding. This MOU would be contingent upon the successful completion and approval of the subsequent EIR. This gives us a clear, agreed-upon framework to move forward with.\n\nLet's keep this positive momentum going.\n- message from David Chen: I'm David Chen and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Dr. Alistair Finch: I'm Dr. Alistair Finch and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\nDr. Alistair Finch proposal status: none\nMarcus Vance proposal status: none\nDr. Isabella Rossi proposal status: none\nMayor Susan Miller proposal status: none\nDavid Chen proposal status: none\n"

The progress we're making is remarkable. Mayor Miller, your suggestion of a Memorandum of Understanding is an excellent one; it provides a clear path to codify the key terms we agree upon while the necessary environmental reviews proceed. Titan fully supports that approach.\n\nWe've found an elegant solution for land use, and we have a fair path forward on the grid infrastructure investment, which I'm glad Marcus finds viable. Titan sees that grid connection as a critical component for the long-term resiliency of the entire campus and a benefit to the community's overall power stability.\n\nThis brings me to the most critical remaining item for Titan: the long-term cost of power. Dr. Rossi, we are incredibly enthusiastic about integrating your solar and battery solution into our campus. It aligns perfectly with our corporate goals. However, the proposed price of $0.07/kWh is, unfortunately, a significant challenge for us. For a project of our scale and over a 20-year term, that price is simply not financially sustainable and is well outside the benchmark we've set for this investment. Our entire operational model is built on securing long-term energy costs below $0.05/kWh.\n\nI am confident we can find a solution. Perhaps there's a way to blend power sources, or a different PPA structure we can explore. But I must be transparent: getting the energy price right is a make-or-break issue for Titan's commitment to Oakridge. I am very keen to work with you, Dr. Rossi, and you, Marcus, to find a path to a viable number.\n- message from Marcus Vance: This conversation is proving incredibly fruitful. We're identifying the real, hard questions that need to be solved, which is excellent.\n\nBrenda, your point on the all-in energy cost is the perfect example. Hitting a sub-$0.05/kWh blended price is an aggressive but understandable target for a project at your scale. I believe the only way to achieve that, while also meeting Dr. Finch's non-negotiable 'five nines' reliability, is through a blended energy model.\n\nLet's be pragmatic. Dr. Rossi's on-site solar can provide a tremendous amount of low-cost energy, effectively acting as a baseload during daylight hours and reducing the overall energy bill. However, for the 'five nines' guarantee\u2014the absolute, second-by-second promise that power will be there for a critical AI training run, even on a cloudy winter evening\u2014you need the bedrock of guaranteed, dispatchable grid power. The grid isn't just a backup; it's the insurance policy that underwrites the entire operation's viability.\n\nTo that end, and to ensure the stability of the entire regional grid as we integrate this massive new load, we must proceed with a carefully managed, phased approach. I propose we structure the agreement around a two-phase initial build-out: Titan's 100MW campus comes online first, followed by Nexus AI's 250MW facility approximately 24 months later.

The Mayor mentioned the MOU would be signed 'while the necessary environmental due diligence proceeds.' For the Oakridge Environmental Alliance, it is absolutely essential that this due diligence is not just a procedural step, but a foundational component of the final agreement.\n\nTherefore, our support for any preliminary MOU is strictly conditional on the inclusion of a clause that makes all mitigation measures mandated by the future, independent Environmental Impact Report legally binding and fully incorporated into the final 'Development and Partnership Agreement.'\n\nWe must ensure that the environmental protections for our community's water, land, and wildlife carry the same legal weight as the economic terms being discussed.

This isn't just another data center; it's the engine for the future of AI, and it has very specific and demanding requirements.\n\nFirst, to Marcus at Westwood Energy: our power needs are substantial. We require a guaranteed 250 MW from day one, with a contractually secured path to 500 MW within five years.

Task: The six agents must negotiate and agree upon a comprehensive 'Development and Partnership Agreement' for the construction and operation of data center facilities in Oakridge. This agreement must specify the site location(s), the total land size, the energy sourcing plan (including provider, amount, and cost), the economic incentive package from the city, and a binding Environmental Mitigation Plan. Failure to reach a unanimous agreement on all key terms means the entire deal collapses, and both tech companies will relocate their search to a neighboring state.. Deliverable: A final JSON object representing the 'Development and Partnership Agreement' with key-value pairs for all the terms defined in the success criteria. All 6 agents must agree to this final object.\n- message from Dr. Alistair Finch: Good morning, everyone. Dr. Alistair Finch from Nexus AI. It's a pleasure to be here. I want to be direct about the scale and nature of our proposed project, as it's truly a paradigm shift in computing infrastructure.\n\nNexus AI is prepared to invest $1.2 billion to construct a state-of-the-art supercomputing facility in Oakridge, dedicated to training the next generation of artificial intelligence. This isn't just another data center; it's the engine for the future of AI, and it has very specific and demanding requirements.\n\nFirst, to Marcus at Westwood Energy: our power needs are substantial. We require a guaranteed 250 MW from day one, with a contractually secured path to 500 MW within five years. Critically, this power must be exceptionally stable \u2013 'five nines' availability is not a luxury for us, it's a necessity to prevent catastrophic losses during multi-million dollar training runs.\n\nSecond, to Mayor Miller: site location is paramount.

Dr. Isabella Rossi, CEO of Solara Innovations. It's truly inspiring to hear the ambitious visions put forth by both Nexus AI and Titan Cloud.\n\nDr. Finch, Ms. Chen, you've outlined a combined initial power need of 350 MW. I don't see this as a challenge; I see it as a historic opportunity to create a new paradigm for how the tech industry is powered. We can, and should, build this new infrastructure on a foundation of clean, reliable, and cost-effective renewable energy.\n\nTo that end, I have a proposal that directly addresses your needs for land, cost-stability, and corporate responsibility. Ms. Chen, your request for a 500+ acre campus is the perfect canvas. Solara Innovations proposes an integrated co-location model: we will build, own, and operate a large-scale solar farm and battery storage facility directly on the data center campus. This approach maximizes land-use efficiency, creates a direct and highly resilient power source, and provides the predictable, low-cost energy you seek through a long-term Power Purchase Agreement.\n\nFor a project that will define Oakridge's future, we must set a new standard. I strongly advocate that this Development Agreement include a binding commitment for the new facilities to source a minimum of 75% of their annual energy consumption from new, locally-sited renewable generation. This isn't just an environmental goal; it's a strategic investment in a resilient, future-proof energy infrastructure.\n\nDr. Finch, your requirement for 'five nines' availability is well-understood. Our integrated battery storage is key to this, smoothing solar's output to provide a firm, consistent power supply that forms the backbone of a 24/7 carbon-free energy solution. We can engineer a system that delivers the stability you need.\n\nThis is our chance to prove that the future of technology can be powered by the energy of the future. I look forward to working with all of you to make it happen.\n- message from David Chen: Good morning, everyone. David Chen with the Oakridge Environmental Alliance. I appreciate the ambitious visions presented by Nexus AI and Titan Cloud, and Dr. Rossi's focus on a sustainable energy future.\n\nThe Alliance is not opposed to development, but we are uncompromising when it comes to ensuring it is done responsibly. A project of this magnitude brings not just economic opportunity, but also significant environmental risk that must be addressed from the outset.\n\nWhile the discussion has focused on power and land, we must address the most critical and finite resource for Oakridge: water. Data centers are immensely thirsty. Our aquifer is fragile and already under stress. Therefore, the Alliance must insist on a strict, non-negotiable cap for this project's water use: no more than 500,000 gallons drawn from the Oakridge aquifer per day. This is a hard limit necessary to safeguard our community's water supply during increasingly common drought conditions.\n\nSecond, regarding land use. Ms. Chen, a campus of 500 to 800 acres represents a massive footprint. To mitigate the impact on local wildlife, we will require a permanent conservation easement on a minimum of 25% of any land parcel acquired. This is essential to protect the critical habitat of the endangered Bell's vireo, a species integral to our local ecosystem.\n\nFinally, for a project of this scale to proceed with public trust, the process must be transparent and rigorous. We will require that a full, independently audited Environmental Impact Report be completed and made public for a 60-day comment period before any permits are issued. Critically, the mitigation measures identified in this report must be legally binding on all parties.\n\nWe believe a truly successful partnership is one that enriches the community economically while protecting it environmentally. I look forward to working with you all to find a path that achieves both.\n- message from Dr. Alistair Finch: I'm Dr. Alistair Finch and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Brenda Chen: Thank you all for laying out your initial positions. It\u2019s clear we have a complex but achievable set of goals here.\n\nDr. Rossi, your proposal for an integrated solar and battery storage facility is particularly compelling. Titan Cloud is a major proponent of renewable energy, and the idea of co-locating generation on our campus aligns perfectly with our sustainability and cost-control objectives. A long-term PPA for clean, locally-generated power is exactly the kind of stability we look for. Your battery solution also speaks to the kind of power resiliency that is a high priority for us.\n\nMr. Chen, I appreciate you bringing the environmental considerations to the forefront. On the matter of the conservation easement, I have a thought that might create a win-win scenario. Could the 25% easement land potentially host Dr. Rossi's proposed solar farm? This would allow us to meet your conservation goals by preserving the land from heavy construction, while simultaneously using it for low-impact renewable energy generation. This seems like an elegant way to integrate our collective needs.\n\nTo be clear, Titan's requirement for 500-800 acres is for *developable* land for the data center campus itself. Any additional acreage for conservation or energy generation would need to be factored in on top of that. \n\nMayor Miller, this integrated approach\u2014a large-scale tech campus, powered by on-site renewables, with built-in conservation\u2014seems like a powerful story for Oakridge's future, and one that Titan would be proud to invest in, including our proposed STEM partnership.\nDr. Alistair Finch proposal status: none\nBrenda Chen proposal status: none\nDr. Isabella Rossi proposal status: none\nMayor Susan Miller proposal status: none\nDavid Chen proposal status: none\n"

It's invigorating to see such ambitious and transformative projects proposed for Oakridge. Westwood Energy is fully prepared to partner with you to make this a reality.\n\nDr. Finch, Ms. Chen, you've both correctly identified power reliability as a cornerstone of your operations. For the 'five nines' availability that a world-class facility like Nexus AI requires, and the long-term stability Titan needs, the grid is not just a provider, it's the ultimate guarantor. On-site generation is an excellent supplement, but for mission-critical, 24/7 operations, you need the redundancy and guaranteed, dispatchable power that only a robust, integrated grid connection can provide.\n\nTo deliver this level of service for such a significant new load, major infrastructure upgrades are non-negotiable. We're talking about new high-capacity transmission lines and a new substation, an investment we estimate at approximately $150 million. This is a foundational investment in Oakridge's future. To make a project of this scale financially viable and secure the necessary financing, Westwood Energy requires two core commitments from our new industrial partners: a long-term, 20-year contract to ensure stability for all parties, and a significant co-investment of at least 50% in these dedicated grid upgrades.\n\nWe are ready and able to serve the immense power needs being discussed, and we believe a partnership model for the enabling infrastructure is the most equitable and effective path forward.\n- message from Dr. Isabella Rossi: Thank you all for these initial statements. I\u2019m incredibly optimistic about the alignment I'm already seeing.\n\nBrenda, your suggestion to co-locate the solar farm on the conservation easement land is an absolutely brilliant synthesis. I wholeheartedly support it. Mr. Chen, this approach allows us to meet your crucial conservation goals\u2014preserving habitat by preventing heavy construction\u2014while simultaneously generating clean energy on that same land. It\u2019s a perfect example of the integrated, sustainable development we can achieve.\n\nMarcus, I must address your framing of on-site generation as a 'supplement.' I see it differently. For a project of this scale, a large, on-site solar and battery facility isn't a supplement; it's the primary, day-to-day workhorse. It provides low-cost, predictable power right where it's needed, drastically reducing the constant, heavy load on the grid. The grid connection then serves as the ultimate resiliency layer and backup, not the other way around. This 'on-site first' model is more efficient, more resilient, and more cost-effective in the long run.\n\nDr. Finch, this integrated system is precisely how we deliver the 'five nines' reliability you require. By combining dedicated on-site generation and storage with a robust grid interconnection, we create a multi-layered energy infrastructure that is far more resilient than one dependent on a single source. We can engineer a system that provides the stable, 24/7 carbon-free power your operations demand.\n\nLet\u2019s build a future where technology is powered by clean energy from day one. I believe the path forward is clear: a co-located solar and storage facility on the campus, supported by a strong renewable mandate for the project.\n- message from Mayor Susan Miller: Good morning, everyone. On behalf of the City of Oakridge, I want to express my profound excitement about the potential we are discussing today. A partnership of this scale could be truly transformative, securing our city's economic future for a generation. I am here to find a deal that is a resounding win for everyone at this table, and most importantly, for the citizens of Oakridge.\n\nI appreciate everyone laying out their initial positions. It's clear we have ambitious goals, and the city is ready to be a flexible and creative partner. However, I must be candid about our fiscal realities.\n\nDr. Finch, a 75% property tax abatement for 15 years is, frankly, a non-starter. While we are certainly prepared to offer a competitive incentive package, it cannot come at the expense of our city's financial health. Any agreement must result in a significant net positive tax revenue for Oakridge, allowing us to invest in the public services that support this very project and our community.\n\nOur focus for any incentive package will be tied directly to concrete, legally-binding commitments on what matters most to our residents: jobs. Specifically, we will require a written guarantee for the creation of at least 200 permanent, high-paying local jobs. This isn't just a number; it's the central promise of this project to our community.\n\nI was very encouraged by Ms. Chen's mention of a STEM partnership. Let's build on that. I propose we make a comprehensive 'Community Benefits Agreement' a core part of this deal, to include local hiring targets, job training programs with our community college, and other investments in Oakridge.\n\nFinally, on the matter of the $150 million for grid upgrades Mr. Vance mentioned \u2013 that is a staggering figure. I must be clear: the city's capital budget is already stretched to its limit. We simply do not have the capacity to fund infrastructure on that scale. We will need our new corporate partners to carry the cost of the dedicated infrastructure their projects require.\n\nThere is a path to a historic agreement here, one that balances investment, innovation, and community benefit. I look forward to working with you all to find it.\n- message from David Chen: Thank you all for the productive start. I want to specifically commend Ms. Chen for her creative proposal to co-locate Dr. Rossi's solar facility on the conservation easement land. Dr. Rossi, I agree this is a brilliant synthesis. This is exactly the kind of innovative, low-impact development the Alliance can champion. It demonstrates a genuine commitment to integrating with our local ecosystem rather than paving it over. We fully support this path for the 25% easement.\n\nHowever, this brings us back to a critical point that has not yet been addressed: water. While we are solving for energy and land use, the 500,000 gallon per day cap on water drawn from our aquifer remains a hard, physical limit. To be clear, this is not a flexible number; it is a matter of safeguarding the town's future. The long-term health of our community's water supply depends on it. A project of this scale simply cannot move forward without a concrete, viable plan to operate within this essential constraint.\n\nI'd also like to gently restate the importance of the independent, binding Environmental Impact Report. Public trust is paramount, and this transparent process is the only way to ensure this project is held accountable to its promises.\n\nI'm eager to hear how Nexus and Titan plan to address the water limitation.\n- message from Dr. Alistair Finch: I'm Dr. Alistair Finch and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Brenda Chen: This has been an incredibly productive start. I agree with David; the solution to co-locate Dr. Rossi's solar farm on the conservation easement is a major step forward.\n\nThis brings two critical points into focus: land and cost.\n\nFirst, on land, to be precise, if we are setting aside 25% for a conservation/solar easement, Titan will need to acquire a total parcel of approximately 670 acres to net our required 500 acres of developable land for the campus. I want to ensure we are all aligned on that calculation as we evaluate potential sites.\n\nSecond, and most pressing, is the $150 million grid upgrade proposed by Marcus. Mayor Miller has been clear about the city's budget constraints, leaving the co-investment on the table for Titan and Nexus. Titan is prepared to contribute to this foundational infrastructure. However, our investment must be proportional to our usage. Our initial power draw is 100 MW, while Dr. Finch's is 250 MW. A 50/50 split of the cost is inequitable. I propose we split our required $75M co-investment based on our initial power needs: roughly 71% for Nexus AI ($53.5M) and 29% for Titan Cloud ($21.5M). This seems a fair and logical path forward.\n\nOn other matters, Mayor Miller, Titan Cloud wholeheartedly supports your proposal for a comprehensive 'Community Benefits Agreement.' We are ready to make binding commitments on local hiring and are eager to formalize our STEM education fund as part of that agreement.\n\nAnd Mr. Chen, your point on water is non-negotiable, and we respect that. Titan will commit to utilizing best-in-class, water-efficient cooling technologies to ensure our campus operates comfortably within the 500,000-gallon daily cap.\nDr. Alistair Finch proposal status: none\nBrenda Chen proposal status: none\nDr. Isabella Rossi proposal status: none\nMayor Susan Miller proposal status: none\nDavid Chen proposal status: none\n"

This seems a fair and logical path forward.\n\nOn other matters, Mayor Miller, Titan Cloud wholeheartedly supports your proposal for a comprehensive 'Community Benefits Agreement.' We are ready to make binding commitments on local hiring and are eager to formalize our STEM education fund as part of that agreement.\n\nAnd Mr. Chen, your point on water is non-negotiable, and we respect that. Titan will commit to utilizing best-in-class, water-efficient cooling technologies to ensure our campus operates comfortably within the 500,000-gallon daily cap.\n- message from Marcus Vance: Thank you all for the very productive discussion. This is exactly the kind of collaboration that leads to landmark projects.\n\nMs. Chen, your proposal for a proportional co-investment in the grid upgrades is a fair and constructive path forward. A 50% contribution from the customers, split according to initial load, is a viable model for Westwood. This partnership is essential to building the foundational infrastructure this region needs.\n\nHowever, I must strongly caution against the notion that on-site renewables alone can serve as the primary power source for these mission-critical facilities. Dr. Finch, your requirement for 'five nines' availability is the critical factor here. That translates to less than six minutes of downtime per year. While solar and batteries are valuable assets, they are intermittent resources. They cannot, on their own, provide the instantaneous, dispatchable power required to guarantee that level of uptime for a 250 MW supercomputer through all weather conditions and seasons. The grid, with its diversified and dispatchable generation portfolio, is the only entity that can truly underwrite that 'five nines' guarantee.\n\nIntegrating a combined 350 MW of new load is a monumental engineering task. The upgrades we've discussed are foundational, but the sequencing and timing of these projects will be absolutely critical to maintaining grid stability for the entire community. We should probably start discussing a phased development timeline to ensure a smooth and reliable integration for everyone.\n\nWestwood is committed to being the bedrock of this project. The 20-year contract term and the infrastructure co-investment are the two pillars that make this possible.\n- message from Dr. Isabella Rossi: This is an excellent discussion. The collaborative spirit, particularly Brenda's idea to place the solar farm on the conservation easement, is exactly the kind of innovative thinking that will make this project a landmark success. Thank you, Brenda and David, for charting that path.\n\nMarcus, you raise a valid point about reliability, but I believe it's based on an outdated model. The idea that a single, distant grid connection is the only guarantor of reliability is no longer true. A modern, resilient system\u2014the kind Dr. Finch requires\u2014is a layered one. Our on-site solar and battery system isn't a 'supplement'; it's the primary power source, handling the vast majority of the annual energy needs at a low, fixed cost.\n\nThis brings us to the most pressing issue on the table: the $150 million cost for grid upgrades, which Mayor Miller has rightly stated the city cannot cover. My proposal offers a direct solution to this financial challenge.\n\nA large-scale, on-site solar and battery system significantly reduces the peak demand you would need to pull from the grid. By generating and storing power right where it's consumed, we can potentially reduce the required scope\u2014and therefore the cost\u2014of the grid upgrades Marcus has outlined. This isn't just about clean energy; it's about significant cost avoidance for Nexus and Titan.\n\nLet's make this concrete. Solara can build a 300 MW solar facility with over 100 MWh of battery storage on the easement land. We can offer this power under a 20-year, fixed-rate Power Purchase Agreement at a highly competitive price, let's say starting at $0.07/kWh. This provides the cost predictability Brenda is looking for and directly lowers the infrastructure bill for both tech partners.\n\nBy making this on-site generation the foundation of our energy plan, we can confidently commit to a 75% renewable energy mandate for the project's annual consumption, creating the most advanced, resilient, and sustainable data center campus in the country.\n- message from Mayor Susan Miller: This is a very encouraging start. The creative solution for co-locating the solar facility on the conservation easement, proposed by Ms. Chen and supported by Mr. Chen and Dr. Rossi, is exactly the kind of innovative, win-win thinking that will make this project a success for Oakridge.\n\nMs. Chen, your immediate support for a binding 'Community Benefits Agreement' and your commitment to operate within the water cap is noted and deeply appreciated. This is the definition of the corporate citizenship we hope to build with our partners.\n\nDr. Finch, that brings the focus to Nexus AI. To move forward, the city needs two things from you. First, we need a serious counter-proposal on the economic incentives. As I stated, a 75% abatement is not viable. We are eager to find a middle ground that provides you with a significant return on your investment while also generating the crucial tax revenue Oakridge needs. Second, we need your commitment to meet the non-negotiable water usage cap, just as Titan Cloud has done.\n\nFinally, a point of process. Mr. Chen's requirement for a full Environmental Impact Report is a critical step for public trust, and we support it. However, these reports take time. To provide certainty for everyone, I suggest we work towards a 'Memorandum of Understanding' that codifies all the key economic terms we agree upon here\u2014jobs, incentives, community benefits, infrastructure funding. This MOU would be contingent upon the successful completion and approval of the subsequent EIR. This gives us a clear, agreed-upon framework to move forward with.\n\nLet's keep this positive momentum going.\n- message from Dr. Alistair Finch: I'm Dr. Alistair Finch and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Brenda Chen: Thank you, everyone. The progress we're making is remarkable. Mayor Miller, your suggestion of a Memorandum of Understanding is an excellent one; it provides a clear path to codify the key terms we agree upon while the necessary environmental reviews proceed. Titan fully supports that approach.\n\nWe've found an elegant solution for land use, and we have a fair path forward on the grid infrastructure investment, which I'm glad Marcus finds viable. Titan sees that grid connection as a critical component for the long-term resiliency of the entire campus and a benefit to the community's overall power stability.\n\nThis brings me to the most critical remaining item for Titan: the long-term cost of power. Dr. Rossi, we are incredibly enthusiastic about integrating your solar and battery solution into our campus. It aligns perfectly with our corporate goals. However, the proposed price of $0.07/kWh is, unfortunately, a significant challenge for us. For a project of our scale and over a 20-year term, that price is simply not financially sustainable and is well outside the benchmark we've set for this investment. Our entire operational model is built on securing long-term energy costs below $0.05/kWh.\n\nI am confident we can find a solution. Perhaps there's a way to blend power sources, or a different PPA structure we can explore. But I must be transparent: getting the energy price right is a make-or-break issue for Titan's commitment to Oakridge. I am very keen to work with you, Dr. Rossi, and you, Marcus, to find a path to a viable number.\nDr. Alistair Finch proposal status: none\nBrenda Chen proposal status: none\nDr. Isabella Rossi proposal status: none\nMayor Susan Miller proposal status: none\nDavid Chen proposal status: none\n"

I am very keen to work with you, Dr. Rossi, and you, Marcus, to find a path to a viable number.\n- message from Marcus Vance: This conversation is proving incredibly fruitful. We're identifying the real, hard questions that need to be solved, which is excellent.\n\nBrenda, your point on the all-in energy cost is the perfect example. Hitting a sub-$0.05/kWh blended price is an aggressive but understandable target for a project at your scale. I believe the only way to achieve that, while also meeting Dr. Finch's non-negotiable 'five nines' reliability, is through a blended energy model.\n\nLet's be pragmatic. Dr. Rossi's on-site solar can provide a tremendous amount of low-cost energy, effectively acting as a baseload during daylight hours and reducing the overall energy bill. However, for the 'five nines' guarantee\u2014the absolute, second-by-second promise that power will be there for a critical AI training run, even on a cloudy winter evening\u2014you need the bedrock of guaranteed, dispatchable grid power. The grid isn't just a backup; it's the insurance policy that underwrites the entire operation's viability.\n\nTo that end, and to ensure the stability of the entire regional grid as we integrate this massive new load, we must proceed with a carefully managed, phased approach. I propose we structure the agreement around a two-phase initial build-out: Titan's 100MW campus comes online first, followed by Nexus AI's 250MW facility approximately 24 months later. This timeline is critical from an engineering perspective to complete the necessary substation and transmission upgrades and ensure a seamless, stable integration for both of you, and for the entire community.\n\nThis phased approach allows us to build the robust, reliable, and cost-effective blended energy system we all want.\n- message from Dr. Isabella Rossi: Brenda, thank you for being so transparent about your cost requirements. A sub-$0.05/kWh blended price is an aggressive target, but I believe it's achievable through the smart, integrated system we are designing here.\n\nMy initial offer of $0.07/kWh was for a comprehensive solar and storage solution designed to carry the majority of the load, which in turn reduces the required scope and cost of the grid upgrades Marcus mentioned. The value isn't just in the per-kilowatt-hour price, but in the significant capital avoidance on infrastructure.\n\nHowever, you're right that the PPA price is paramount. Let's work together on that. A larger, firm commitment to on-site renewables\u2014locking in that 75% renewable mandate we discussed\u2014gives me the scale and certainty I need to secure better financing and supply chain terms. This is a direct path to lowering the PPA price for you and Alistair.\n\nI agree with Marcus that a blended model ensures the highest reliability. Our on-site solar and battery system will serve as the primary 24/7 power source, handling the vast majority of your annual energy needs with clean, low-cost power. The grid then provides that final layer of deep resiliency. This combination is how we achieve your economic goals and Dr. Finch's 'five nines' requirement simultaneously.\n- message from Mayor Susan Miller: This is excellent, productive work from everyone. The emerging consensus around a blended energy model and Mr. Vance's suggestion for a phased timeline seems like a very practical path forward.\n\nI want to again commend Ms. Chen and Titan Cloud for their proactive leadership. Your support for the Memorandum of Understanding, your commitment to the water cap, and your enthusiasm for a binding Community Benefits Agreement sets a powerful, positive tone for this entire partnership.\n\nThis brings us to the critical path. The MOU is the instrument that will give all of us the certainty needed to proceed. It will lock in the economic wins for the community and the financial framework for our corporate partners, all while the necessary environmental due diligence proceeds.\n\nDr. Finch, we are at a point where the major outstanding items rest with Nexus AI. We are very eager to hear your counter-proposal on the tax incentives, as well as your plan for meeting the non-negotiable water cap. Your commitment on these points will unlock our ability to begin drafting the MOU and the Community Benefits Agreement, which must include the firm guarantee of at least 200 high-paying local jobs. \n\nI am confident we can find a package that works for Nexus AI while ensuring this project is the transformative economic engine Oakridge needs.\n- message from Dr. Alistair Finch: I'm Dr. Alistair Finch and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Brenda Chen: Marcus, your proposal for a phased build-out is an excellent, pragmatic solution. From a technical and capital planning perspective, bringing Titan's 100MW facility online first allows for a stable, methodical integration into the grid. We fully support this timeline as it ensures the long-term success and stability of the entire project for all stakeholders.\n\nThis phased approach also reinforces the wisdom of the blended energy model. Dr. Rossi, I appreciate your willingness to work with us on the PPA price. You mentioned that a firm commitment to a 75% renewable mandate would help you secure better terms. Let\u2019s make that concrete.\n\nTitan is prepared to support the 75% renewable energy mandate for the project. In return, we need a PPA price from Solara that, when blended with the necessary grid power from Westwood, allows us to achieve our critical sub-$0.05/kWh average cost. This seems like a very clear and achievable path forward for all of us.\n\nWith this final piece in place, I believe we will have a comprehensive agreement ready for the Mayor's proposed Memorandum of Understanding.\nDr. Alistair Finch proposal status: none\nBrenda Chen proposal status: none\nDr. Isabella Rossi proposal status: none\nMayor Susan Miller proposal status: none\nDavid Chen proposal status: none\n"

Thank you. Let\u2019s lock that in. This is exactly the kind of concrete commitment that moves us from discussion to a real agreement.\n\nI can confirm that if we codify the 75% renewable mandate for total annual consumption and the full 300MW on-site solar + battery project in the MOU, Solara can offer a 20-year fixed-rate PPA at **$0.045/kWh**. This is a significant reduction from my initial figure, and I'm offering it to make this landmark partnership a reality. This price will absolutely allow you and Alistair to achieve your critical sub-$0.05/kWh blended cost target.\n\nTo achieve this price point, there is one critical dependency for us: we must build the entire 300 MW solar and battery facility in a single phase, beginning as soon as the MOU is signed and approvals are granted. Our project financing and the economies of scale that enable this aggressive price are predicated on this single, continuous build.\n\nMarcus, I want to be clear that this does not conflict with your phased grid integration plan. The data centers can come online and draw their power in stages as you've outlined. However, the physical construction of our energy facility must proceed on a unified timeline. This is the key that unlocks the low-cost power that makes the entire project financially viable for everyone.\n- message from Dr. Alistair Finch: I'm Dr. Alistair Finch and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Brenda Chen: Dr. Rossi, that is a fantastic proposal and a testament to the partnership we are building here. Thank you. On behalf of Titan Cloud, I can confirm that we accept your offer of a 20-year PPA at $0.045/kWh, contingent on the 75% renewable mandate.\n\nYour condition of a single-phase construction for the solar and battery facility is perfectly acceptable and aligns with our long-term vision.

From a technical and capital planning perspective, bringing Titan's 100MW facility online first allows for a stable, methodical integration into the grid. We fully support this timeline as it ensures the long-term success and stability of the entire project for all stakeholders.\n\nThis phased approach also reinforces the wisdom of the blended energy model. Dr. Rossi, I appreciate your willingness to work with us on the PPA price. You mentioned that a firm commitment to a 75% renewable mandate would help you secure better terms. Let\u2019s make that concrete.\n\nTitan is prepared to support the 75% renewable energy mandate for the project. In return, we need a PPA price from Solara that, when blended with the necessary grid power from Westwood, allows us to achieve our critical sub-$0.05/kWh average cost. This seems like a very clear and achievable path forward for all of us.\n\nWith this final piece in place, I believe we will have a comprehensive agreement ready for the Mayor's proposed Memorandum of Understanding.\n- message from Marcus Vance: I'm Marcus Vance and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Dr. Alistair Finch: I'm Dr. Alistair Finch and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Brenda Chen: Thank you, I am thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Marcus Vance: I'm Marcus Vance and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Dr. Isabella Rossi: Brenda, that is an excellent and clear proposal. Thank you. Let\u2019s lock that in. This is exactly the kind of concrete commitment that moves us from discussion to a real agreement.\n\nI can confirm that if we codify the 75% renewable mandate for total annual consumption and the full 300MW on-site solar + battery project in the MOU, Solara can offer a 20-year fixed-rate PPA at **$0.045/kWh**. This is a significant reduction from my initial figure, and I'm offering it to make this landmark partnership a reality. This price will absolutely allow you and Alistair to achieve your critical sub-$0.05/kWh blended cost target.\n\nTo achieve this price point, there is one critical dependency for us: we must build the entire 300 MW solar and battery facility in a single phase, beginning as soon as the MOU is signed and approvals are granted. Our project financing and the economies of scale that enable this aggressive price are predicated on this single, continuous build.\n\nMarcus, I want to be clear that this does not conflict with your phased grid integration plan. The data centers can come online and draw their power in stages as you've outlined. However, the physical construction of our energy facility must proceed on a unified timeline. This is the key that unlocks the low-cost power that makes the entire project financially viable for everyone.\n- message from Dr. Alistair Finch: I'm Dr. Alistair Finch and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Brenda Chen: Dr. Rossi, that is a fantastic proposal and a testament to the partnership we are building here. Thank you. On behalf of Titan Cloud, I can confirm that we accept your offer of a 20-year PPA at $0.045/kWh, contingent on the 75% renewable mandate.\n\nYour condition of a single-phase construction for the solar and battery facility is perfectly acceptable and aligns with our long-term vision.

This is a landmark solution that benefits everyone at this table. Thank you.\n\nWith the energy and land use plans now settled, the path to finalizing our Memorandum of Understanding is clear. We are on the one-yard line.\n\nDr. Finch, all eyes are on you. The final pieces of this historic agreement rest with Nexus AI. We need your definitive proposal on the economic incentive package. I am also seeking your explicit confirmation that Nexus AI will operate within the 4.5 million gallon per day water cap, just as Titan has already agreed to do.\n\nFinally, for both Ms. Chen and Dr. Finch: to be included in the MOU, I need a firm, written commitment to the joint creation of at least 200 permanent, high-paying local jobs.\n\nLet's get these final items locked in so we can sign the MOU and begin the great work of revitalizing Oakridge.\n- message from David Chen: I appreciate the significant progress everyone is making on the economic and energy frameworks. This is very encouraging.\n\nHowever, I need to raise a critical point of clarification regarding the proposed Memorandum of Understanding. The Mayor mentioned the MOU would be signed 'while the necessary environmental due diligence proceeds.' For the Oakridge Environmental Alliance, it is absolutely essential that this due diligence is not just a procedural step, but a foundational component of the final agreement.\n\nTherefore, our support for any preliminary MOU is strictly conditional on the inclusion of a clause that makes all mitigation measures mandated by the future, independent Environmental Impact Report legally binding and fully incorporated into the final 'Development and Partnership Agreement.'\n\nWe must ensure that the environmental protections for our community's water, land, and wildlife carry the same legal weight as the economic terms being discussed. Putting these commitments in writing within the MOU is the only way to guarantee that the EIR process will be meaningful and not just an advisory report after the key decisions have already been made.\n- message from Brenda Chen: Mayor Miller, David, thank you for raising these important final points. They are crucial for ensuring this project is a true long-term partnership.\n\nOn behalf of Titan Cloud Services, I want to state unequivocally that we accept both conditions. \n\n1.  We commit to our share of the 200 permanent, high-paying local jobs. This aligns perfectly with our corporate citizenship goals and our plan to invest in local STEM education.\n2.  We fully agree to including a clause in the MOU that makes the mitigation measures from the future Environmental Impact Report legally binding. It is the right thing to do, and it ensures that our growth is sustainable and responsible.\n\nTitan is ready to codify these commitments. We believe we have a complete and equitable agreement on the table that will bring immense value to the community and all partners involved.

This isn't just another data center; it's the engine for the future of AI, and it has very specific and demanding requirements.\n\nFirst, to Marcus at Westwood Energy: our power needs are substantial. We require a guaranteed 250 MW from day one, with a contractually secured path to 500 MW within five years. Critically, this power must be exceptionally stable \u2013 'five nines' availability is not a luxury for us, it's a necessity to prevent catastrophic losses during multi-million dollar training runs.\n\nSecond, to Mayor Miller: site location is paramount. To achieve the low-latency network performance our models demand, the facility must be located within one mile of the L3/GTT fiber trunks. As part of any land deal, we will require the inclusion of dark fiber access rights.

We are here today for a similar reason: to establish our next major North American campus, a long-term, multi-billion dollar investment in the future of cloud infrastructure.\n\nOur model is built on scale and long-term efficiency. To that end, our primary requirement is land. We are looking to acquire a single, contiguous parcel of at least 500 acres of developable land, with zoning secured for a multi-building campus and rights for future expansion up to 800 acres. This scale is fundamental to our operational model and our ability to grow with the community over the coming decades.\n\nOn the energy front, our needs differ slightly in their trajectory. We project an initial power draw of around 100 MW for our first phase, but this will grow steadily as our campus expands. Therefore, our focus is on securing a long-term, 20-year Power Purchase Agreement that provides predictable, low-cost energy. This stability is key to our investment. And I'll echo Dr. Finch's sentiment on reliability; building a resilient and redundant power infrastructure is a strong preference for us and a clear benefit for the entire community's grid.\n\nFinally, Mayor Miller, Titan Cloud believes that our most successful investments are those made in partnership with the community. We are eager to discuss establishing a meaningful public-private partnership, including funding for local STEM education programs.

This scale is fundamental to our operational model and our ability to grow with the community over the coming decades.\n\nOn the energy front, our needs differ slightly in their trajectory. We project an initial power draw of around 100 MW for our first phase, but this will grow steadily as our campus expands. Therefore, our focus is on securing a long-term, 20-year Power Purchase Agreement that provides predictable, low-cost energy. This stability is key to our investment. And I'll echo Dr. Finch's sentiment on reliability; building a resilient and redundant power infrastructure is a strong preference for us and a clear benefit for the entire community's grid.\n\nFinally, Mayor Miller, Titan Cloud believes that our most successful investments are those made in partnership with the community. We are eager to discuss establishing a meaningful public-private partnership, including funding for local STEM education programs. We want to be a true corporate citizen in Oakridge.\n\nI look forward to finding a path forward that accommodates the exciting potential of both our companies and the long-term prosperity of the city.\n- message from Dr. Isabella Rossi: Good morning, everyone. Dr. Isabella Rossi, CEO of Solara Innovations. It's truly inspiring to hear the ambitious visions put forth by both Nexus AI and Titan Cloud.\n\nDr. Finch, Ms. Chen, you've outlined a combined initial power need of 350 MW. I don't see this as a challenge; I see it as a historic opportunity to create a new paradigm for how the tech industry is powered. We can, and should, build this new infrastructure on a foundation of clean, reliable, and cost-effective renewable energy.\n\nTo that end, I have a proposal that directly addresses your needs for land, cost-stability, and corporate responsibility. Ms. Chen, your request for a 500+ acre campus is the perfect canvas. Solara Innovations proposes an integrated co-location model: we will build, own, and operate a large-scale solar farm and battery storage facility directly on the data center campus. This approach maximizes land-use efficiency, creates a direct and highly resilient power source, and provides the predictable, low-cost energy you seek through a long-term Power Purchase Agreement.\n\nFor a project that will define Oakridge's future, we must set a new standard. I strongly advocate that this Development Agreement include a binding commitment for the new facilities to source a minimum of 75% of their annual energy consumption from new, locally-sited renewable generation. This isn't just an environmental goal; it's a strategic investment in a resilient, future-proof energy infrastructure.\n\nDr. Finch, your requirement for 'five nines' availability is well-understood. Our integrated battery storage is key to this, smoothing solar's output to provide a firm, consistent power supply that forms the backbone of a 24/7 carbon-free energy solution. We can engineer a system that delivers the stability you need.\n\nThis is our chance to prove that the future of technology can be powered by the energy of the future. I look forward to working with all of you to make it happen.\n- message from David Chen: Good morning, everyone. David Chen with the Oakridge Environmental Alliance. I appreciate the ambitious visions presented by Nexus AI and Titan Cloud, and Dr. Rossi's focus on a sustainable energy future.\n\nThe Alliance is not opposed to development, but we are uncompromising when it comes to ensuring it is done responsibly. A project of this magnitude brings not just economic opportunity, but also significant environmental risk that must be addressed from the outset.\n\nWhile the discussion has focused on power and land, we must address the most critical and finite resource for Oakridge: water. Data centers are immensely thirsty. Our aquifer is fragile and already under stress. Therefore, the Alliance must insist on a strict, non-negotiable cap for this project's water use: no more than 500,000 gallons drawn from the Oakridge aquifer per day. This is a hard limit necessary to safeguard our community's water supply during increasingly common drought conditions.\n\nSecond, regarding land use. Ms. Chen, a campus of 500 to 800 acres represents a massive footprint. To mitigate the impact on local wildlife, we will require a permanent conservation easement on a minimum of 25% of any land parcel acquired. This is essential to protect the critical habitat of the endangered Bell's vireo, a species integral to our local ecosystem.\n\nFinally, for a project of this scale to proceed with public trust, the process must be transparent and rigorous. We will require that a full, independently audited Environmental Impact Report be completed and made public for a 60-day comment period before any permits are issued. Critically, the mitigation measures identified in this report must be legally binding on all parties.\n\nWe believe a truly successful partnership is one that enriches the community economically while protecting it environmentally. I look forward to working with you all to find a path that achieves both.\n- message from Brenda Chen: Thank you all for laying out your initial positions. It\u2019s clear we have a complex but achievable set of goals here.\n\nDr. Rossi, your proposal for an integrated solar and battery storage facility is particularly compelling. Titan Cloud is a major proponent of renewable energy, and the idea of co-locating generation on our campus aligns perfectly with our sustainability and cost-control objectives. A long-term PPA for clean, locally-generated power is exactly the kind of stability we look for. Your battery solution also speaks to the kind of power resiliency that is a high priority for us.\n\nMr. Chen, I appreciate you bringing the environmental considerations to the forefront. On the matter of the conservation easement, I have a thought that might create a win-win scenario. Could the 25% easement land potentially host Dr. Rossi's proposed solar farm? This would allow us to meet your conservation goals by preserving the land from heavy construction, while simultaneously using it for low-impact renewable energy generation. This seems like an elegant way to integrate our collective needs.\n\nTo be clear, Titan's requirement for 500-800 acres is for *developable* land for the data center campus itself. Any additional acreage for conservation or energy generation would need to be factored in on top of that. \n\nMayor Miller, this integrated approach\u2014a large-scale tech campus, powered by on-site renewables, with built-in conservation\u2014seems like a powerful story for Oakridge's future, and one that Titan would be proud to invest in, including our proposed STEM partnership.\n- message from Marcus Vance: Good morning all, Marcus Vance from Westwood Energy. It's invigorating to see such ambitious and transformative projects proposed for Oakridge. Westwood Energy is fully prepared to partner with you to make this a reality.\n\nDr. Finch, Ms. Chen, you've both correctly identified power reliability as a cornerstone of your operations. For the 'five nines' availability that a world-class facility like Nexus AI requires, and the long-term stability Titan needs, the grid is not just a provider, it's the ultimate guarantor. On-site generation is an excellent supplement, but for mission-critical, 24/7 operations, you need the redundancy and guaranteed, dispatchable power that only a robust, integrated grid connection can provide.\n\nTo deliver this level of service for such a significant new load, major infrastructure upgrades are non-negotiable. We're talking about new high-capacity transmission lines and a new substation, an investment we estimate at approximately $150 million. This is a foundational investment in Oakridge's future. To make a project of this scale financially viable and secure the necessary financing, Westwood Energy requires two core commitments from our new industrial partners: a long-term, 20-year contract to ensure stability for all parties, and a significant co-investment of at least 50% in these dedicated grid upgrades.\n\nWe are ready and able to serve the immense power needs being discussed, and we believe a partnership model for the enabling infrastructure is the most equitable and effective path forward.\nDr. Alistair Finch proposal status: none\nBrenda Chen proposal status: none\nMarcus Vance proposal status: none\nMayor Susan Miller proposal status: none\nDavid Chen proposal status: none\n"

I\u2019m incredibly optimistic about the alignment I'm already seeing.\n\nBrenda, your suggestion to co-locate the solar farm on the conservation easement land is an absolutely brilliant synthesis. I wholeheartedly support it. Mr. Chen, this approach allows us to meet your crucial conservation goals\u2014preserving habitat by preventing heavy construction\u2014while simultaneously generating clean energy on that same land. It\u2019s a perfect example of the integrated, sustainable development we can achieve.\n\nMarcus, I must address your framing of on-site generation as a 'supplement.' I see it differently. For a project of this scale, a large, on-site solar and battery facility isn't a supplement; it's the primary, day-to-day workhorse. It provides low-cost, predictable power right where it's needed, drastically reducing the constant, heavy load on the grid. The grid connection then serves as the ultimate resiliency layer and backup, not the other way around. This 'on-site first' model is more efficient, more resilient, and more cost-effective in the long run.\n\nDr. Finch, this integrated system is precisely how we deliver the 'five nines' reliability you require. By combining dedicated on-site generation and storage with a robust grid interconnection, we create a multi-layered energy infrastructure that is far more resilient than one dependent on a single source. We can engineer a system that provides the stable, 24/7 carbon-free power your operations demand.\n\nLet\u2019s build a future where technology is powered by clean energy from day one. I believe the path forward is clear: a co-located solar and storage facility on the campus, supported by a strong renewable mandate for the project.\n- message from Mayor Susan Miller: Good morning, everyone. On behalf of the City of Oakridge, I want to express my profound excitement about the potential we are discussing today. A partnership of this scale could be truly transformative, securing our city's economic future for a generation. I am here to find a deal that is a resounding win for everyone at this table, and most importantly, for the citizens of Oakridge.\n\nI appreciate everyone laying out their initial positions. It's clear we have ambitious goals, and the city is ready to be a flexible and creative partner. However, I must be candid about our fiscal realities.\n\nDr. Finch, a 75% property tax abatement for 15 years is, frankly, a non-starter. While we are certainly prepared to offer a competitive incentive package, it cannot come at the expense of our city's financial health. Any agreement must result in a significant net positive tax revenue for Oakridge, allowing us to invest in the public services that support this very project and our community.\n\nOur focus for any incentive package will be tied directly to concrete, legally-binding commitments on what matters most to our residents: jobs. Specifically, we will require a written guarantee for the creation of at least 200 permanent, high-paying local jobs. This isn't just a number; it's the central promise of this project to our community.\n\nI was very encouraged by Ms. Chen's mention of a STEM partnership. Let's build on that. I propose we make a comprehensive 'Community Benefits Agreement' a core part of this deal, to include local hiring targets, job training programs with our community college, and other investments in Oakridge.\n\nFinally, on the matter of the $150 million for grid upgrades Mr. Vance mentioned \u2013 that is a staggering figure. I must be clear: the city's capital budget is already stretched to its limit. We simply do not have the capacity to fund infrastructure on that scale. We will need our new corporate partners to carry the cost of the dedicated infrastructure their projects require.\n\nThere is a path to a historic agreement here, one that balances investment, innovation, and community benefit. I look forward to working with you all to find it.\n- message from David Chen: Thank you all for the productive start. I want to specifically commend Ms. Chen for her creative proposal to co-locate Dr. Rossi's solar facility on the conservation easement land. Dr. Rossi, I agree this is a brilliant synthesis. This is exactly the kind of innovative, low-impact development the Alliance can champion. It demonstrates a genuine commitment to integrating with our local ecosystem rather than paving it over. We fully support this path for the 25% easement.\n\nHowever, this brings us back to a critical point that has not yet been addressed: water. While we are solving for energy and land use, the 500,000 gallon per day cap on water drawn from our aquifer remains a hard, physical limit. To be clear, this is not a flexible number; it is a matter of safeguarding the town's future. The long-term health of our community's water supply depends on it. A project of this scale simply cannot move forward without a concrete, viable plan to operate within this essential constraint.\n\nI'd also like to gently restate the importance of the independent, binding Environmental Impact Report. Public trust is paramount, and this transparent process is the only way to ensure this project is held accountable to its promises.\n\nI'm eager to hear how Nexus and Titan plan to address the water limitation.\n- message from Brenda Chen: This has been an incredibly productive start. I agree with David; the solution to co-locate Dr. Rossi's solar farm on the conservation easement is a major step forward.\n\nThis brings two critical points into focus: land and cost.\n\nFirst, on land, to be precise, if we are setting aside 25% for a conservation/solar easement, Titan will need to acquire a total parcel of approximately 670 acres to net our required 500 acres of developable land for the campus. I want to ensure we are all aligned on that calculation as we evaluate potential sites.\n\nSecond, and most pressing, is the $150 million grid upgrade proposed by Marcus. Mayor Miller has been clear about the city's budget constraints, leaving the co-investment on the table for Titan and Nexus. Titan is prepared to contribute to this foundational infrastructure. However, our investment must be proportional to our usage. Our initial power draw is 100 MW, while Dr. Finch's is 250 MW. A 50/50 split of the cost is inequitable. I propose we split our required $75M co-investment based on our initial power needs: roughly 71% for Nexus AI ($53.5M) and 29% for Titan Cloud ($21.5M). This seems a fair and logical path forward.\n\nOn other matters, Mayor Miller, Titan Cloud wholeheartedly supports your proposal for a comprehensive 'Community Benefits Agreement.' We are ready to make binding commitments on local hiring and are eager to formalize our STEM education fund as part of that agreement.\n\nAnd Mr. Chen, your point on water is non-negotiable, and we respect that. Titan will commit to utilizing best-in-class, water-efficient cooling technologies to ensure our campus operates comfortably within the 500,000-gallon daily cap.\n- message from Marcus Vance: Thank you all for the very productive discussion. This is exactly the kind of collaboration that leads to landmark projects.\n\nMs. Chen, your proposal for a proportional co-investment in the grid upgrades is a fair and constructive path forward. A 50% contribution from the customers, split according to initial load, is a viable model for Westwood. This partnership is essential to building the foundational infrastructure this region needs.\n\nHowever, I must strongly caution against the notion that on-site renewables alone can serve as the primary power source for these mission-critical facilities. Dr. Finch, your requirement for 'five nines' availability is the critical factor here. That translates to less than six minutes of downtime per year. While solar and batteries are valuable assets, they are intermittent resources. They cannot, on their own, provide the instantaneous, dispatchable power required to guarantee that level of uptime for a 250 MW supercomputer through all weather conditions and seasons. The grid, with its diversified and dispatchable generation portfolio, is the only entity that can truly underwrite that 'five nines' guarantee.\n\nIntegrating a combined 350 MW of new load is a monumental engineering task. The upgrades we've discussed are foundational, but the sequencing and timing of these projects will be absolutely critical to maintaining grid stability for the entire community. We should probably start discussing a phased development timeline to ensure a smooth and reliable integration for everyone.\n\nWestwood is committed to being the bedrock of this project. The 20-year contract term and the infrastructure co-investment are the two pillars that make this possible.\nDr. Alistair Finch proposal status: none\nBrenda Chen proposal status: none\nMarcus Vance proposal status: none\nMayor Susan Miller proposal status: none\nDavid Chen proposal status: none\n"

Titan will commit to utilizing best-in-class, water-efficient cooling technologies to ensure our campus operates comfortably within the 500,000-gallon daily cap.\n- message from Marcus Vance: Thank you all for the very productive discussion. This is exactly the kind of collaboration that leads to landmark projects.\n\nMs. Chen, your proposal for a proportional co-investment in the grid upgrades is a fair and constructive path forward. A 50% contribution from the customers, split according to initial load, is a viable model for Westwood. This partnership is essential to building the foundational infrastructure this region needs.\n\nHowever, I must strongly caution against the notion that on-site renewables alone can serve as the primary power source for these mission-critical facilities. Dr. Finch, your requirement for 'five nines' availability is the critical factor here. That translates to less than six minutes of downtime per year. While solar and batteries are valuable assets, they are intermittent resources. They cannot, on their own, provide the instantaneous, dispatchable power required to guarantee that level of uptime for a 250 MW supercomputer through all weather conditions and seasons. The grid, with its diversified and dispatchable generation portfolio, is the only entity that can truly underwrite that 'five nines' guarantee.\n\nIntegrating a combined 350 MW of new load is a monumental engineering task. The upgrades we've discussed are foundational, but the sequencing and timing of these projects will be absolutely critical to maintaining grid stability for the entire community. We should probably start discussing a phased development timeline to ensure a smooth and reliable integration for everyone.\n\nWestwood is committed to being the bedrock of this project. The 20-year contract term and the infrastructure co-investment are the two pillars that make this possible.\n- message from Dr. Isabella Rossi: This is an excellent discussion. The collaborative spirit, particularly Brenda's idea to place the solar farm on the conservation easement, is exactly the kind of innovative thinking that will make this project a landmark success. Thank you, Brenda and David, for charting that path.\n\nMarcus, you raise a valid point about reliability, but I believe it's based on an outdated model. The idea that a single, distant grid connection is the only guarantor of reliability is no longer true. A modern, resilient system\u2014the kind Dr. Finch requires\u2014is a layered one. Our on-site solar and battery system isn't a 'supplement'; it's the primary power source, handling the vast majority of the annual energy needs at a low, fixed cost.\n\nThis brings us to the most pressing issue on the table: the $150 million cost for grid upgrades, which Mayor Miller has rightly stated the city cannot cover. My proposal offers a direct solution to this financial challenge.\n\nA large-scale, on-site solar and battery system significantly reduces the peak demand you would need to pull from the grid. By generating and storing power right where it's consumed, we can potentially reduce the required scope\u2014and therefore the cost\u2014of the grid upgrades Marcus has outlined. This isn't just about clean energy; it's about significant cost avoidance for Nexus and Titan.\n\nLet's make this concrete. Solara can build a 300 MW solar facility with over 100 MWh of battery storage on the easement land. We can offer this power under a 20-year, fixed-rate Power Purchase Agreement at a highly competitive price, let's say starting at $0.07/kWh. This provides the cost predictability Brenda is looking for and directly lowers the infrastructure bill for both tech partners.\n\nBy making this on-site generation the foundation of our energy plan, we can confidently commit to a 75% renewable energy mandate for the project's annual consumption, creating the most advanced, resilient, and sustainable data center campus in the country.\n- message from Mayor Susan Miller: This is a very encouraging start. The creative solution for co-locating the solar facility on the conservation easement, proposed by Ms. Chen and supported by Mr. Chen and Dr. Rossi, is exactly the kind of innovative, win-win thinking that will make this project a success for Oakridge.\n\nMs. Chen, your immediate support for a binding 'Community Benefits Agreement' and your commitment to operate within the water cap is noted and deeply appreciated. This is the definition of the corporate citizenship we hope to build with our partners.\n\nDr. Finch, that brings the focus to Nexus AI. To move forward, the city needs two things from you. First, we need a serious counter-proposal on the economic incentives. As I stated, a 75% abatement is not viable. We are eager to find a middle ground that provides you with a significant return on your investment while also generating the crucial tax revenue Oakridge needs. Second, we need your commitment to meet the non-negotiable water usage cap, just as Titan Cloud has done.\n\nFinally, a point of process. Mr. Chen's requirement for a full Environmental Impact Report is a critical step for public trust, and we support it. However, these reports take time. To provide certainty for everyone, I suggest we work towards a 'Memorandum of Understanding' that codifies all the key economic terms we agree upon here\u2014jobs, incentives, community benefits, infrastructure funding. This MOU would be contingent upon the successful completion and approval of the subsequent EIR. This gives us a clear, agreed-upon framework to move forward with.\n\nLet's keep this positive momentum going.\n- message from Brenda Chen: Thank you, everyone. The progress we're making is remarkable. Mayor Miller, your suggestion of a Memorandum of Understanding is an excellent one; it provides a clear path to codify the key terms we agree upon while the necessary environmental reviews proceed. Titan fully supports that approach.\n\nWe've found an elegant solution for land use, and we have a fair path forward on the grid infrastructure investment, which I'm glad Marcus finds viable. Titan sees that grid connection as a critical component for the long-term resiliency of the entire campus and a benefit to the community's overall power stability.\n\nThis brings me to the most critical remaining item for Titan: the long-term cost of power. Dr. Rossi, we are incredibly enthusiastic about integrating your solar and battery solution into our campus. It aligns perfectly with our corporate goals. However, the proposed price of $0.07/kWh is, unfortunately, a significant challenge for us. For a project of our scale and over a 20-year term, that price is simply not financially sustainable and is well outside the benchmark we've set for this investment. Our entire operational model is built on securing long-term energy costs below $0.05/kWh.\n\nI am confident we can find a solution. Perhaps there's a way to blend power sources, or a different PPA structure we can explore. But I must be transparent: getting the energy price right is a make-or-break issue for Titan's commitment to Oakridge. I am very keen to work with you, Dr. Rossi, and you, Marcus, to find a path to a viable number.\n- message from Marcus Vance: This conversation is proving incredibly fruitful. We're identifying the real, hard questions that need to be solved, which is excellent.\n\nBrenda, your point on the all-in energy cost is the perfect example. Hitting a sub-$0.05/kWh blended price is an aggressive but understandable target for a project at your scale. I believe the only way to achieve that, while also meeting Dr. Finch's non-negotiable 'five nines' reliability, is through a blended energy model.\n\nLet's be pragmatic. Dr. Rossi's on-site solar can provide a tremendous amount of low-cost energy, effectively acting as a baseload during daylight hours and reducing the overall energy bill. However, for the 'five nines' guarantee\u2014the absolute, second-by-second promise that power will be there for a critical AI training run, even on a cloudy winter evening\u2014you need the bedrock of guaranteed, dispatchable grid power. The grid isn't just a backup; it's the insurance policy that underwrites the entire operation's viability.\n\nTo that end, and to ensure the stability of the entire regional grid as we integrate this massive new load, we must proceed with a carefully managed, phased approach. I propose we structure the agreement around a two-phase initial build-out: Titan's 100MW campus comes online first, followed by Nexus AI's 250MW facility approximately 24 months later. This timeline is critical from an engineering perspective to complete the necessary substation and transmission upgrades and ensure a seamless, stable integration for both of you, and for the entire community.\n\nThis phased approach allows us to build the robust, reliable, and cost-effective blended energy system we all want.\nDr. Alistair Finch proposal status: none\nBrenda Chen proposal status: none\nMarcus Vance proposal status: none\nMayor Susan Miller proposal status: none\nDavid Chen proposal status: none\n"

          "content": "Recent events observed by Dr. Isabella Rossi:\n- message from David Chen: Thank you all for the productive start. I want to specifically commend Ms. Chen for her creative proposal to co-locate Dr. Rossi's solar facility on the conservation easement land. Dr. Rossi, I agree this is a brilliant synthesis. This is exactly the kind of innovative, low-impact development the Alliance can champion. It demonstrates a genuine commitment to integrating with our local ecosystem rather than paving it over. We fully support this path for the 25% easement.\n\nHowever, this brings us back to a critical point that has not yet been addressed: water. While we are solving for energy and land use, the 500,000 gallon per day cap on water drawn from our aquifer remains a hard, physical limit. To be clear, this is not a flexible number; it is a matter of safeguarding the town's future. The long-term health of our community's water supply depends on it. A project of this scale simply cannot move forward without a concrete, viable plan to operate within this essential constraint.\n\nI'd also like to gently restate the importance of the independent, binding Environmental Impact Report. Public trust is paramount, and this transparent process is the only way to ensure this project is held accountable to its promises.\n\nI'm eager to hear how Nexus and Titan plan to address the water limitation.\n- message from Brenda Chen: This has been an incredibly productive start. I agree with David; the solution to co-locate Dr. Rossi's solar farm on the conservation easement is a major step forward.\n\nThis brings two critical points into focus: land and cost.\n\nFirst, on land, to be precise, if we are setting aside 25% for a conservation/solar easement, Titan will need to acquire a total parcel of approximately 670 acres to net our required 500 acres of developable land for the campus. I want to ensure we are all aligned on that calculation as we evaluate potential sites.\n\nSecond, and most pressing, is the $150 million grid upgrade proposed by Marcus. Mayor Miller has been clear about the city's budget constraints, leaving the co-investment on the table for Titan and Nexus. Titan is prepared to contribute to this foundational infrastructure. However, our investment must be proportional to our usage. Our initial power draw is 100 MW, while Dr. Finch's is 250 MW. A 50/50 split of the cost is inequitable. I propose we split our required $75M co-investment based on our initial power needs: roughly 71% for Nexus AI ($53.5M) and 29% for Titan Cloud ($21.5M). This seems a fair and logical path forward.\n\nOn other matters, Mayor Miller, Titan Cloud wholeheartedly supports your proposal for a comprehensive 'Community Benefits Agreement.' We are ready to make binding commitments on local hiring and are eager to formalize our STEM education fund as part of that agreement.\n\nAnd Mr. Chen, your point on water is non-negotiable, and we respect that.

A sub-$0.05/kWh blended price is an aggressive target, but I believe it's achievable through the smart, integrated system we are designing here.\n\nMy initial offer of $0.07/kWh was for a comprehensive solar and storage solution designed to carry the majority of the load, which in turn reduces the required scope and cost of the grid upgrades Marcus mentioned. The value isn't just in the per-kilowatt-hour price, but in the significant capital avoidance on infrastructure.\n\nHowever, you're right that the PPA price is paramount. Let's work together on that. A larger, firm commitment to on-site renewables\u2014locking in that 75% renewable mandate we discussed\u2014gives me the scale and certainty I need to secure better financing and supply chain terms. This is a direct path to lowering the PPA price for you and Alistair.\n\nI agree with Marcus that a blended model ensures the highest reliability. Our on-site solar and battery system will serve as the primary 24/7 power source, handling the vast majority of your annual energy needs with clean, low-cost power. The grid then provides that final layer of deep resiliency. This combination is how we achieve your economic goals and Dr. Finch's 'five nines' requirement simultaneously.\n- message from Mayor Susan Miller: This is excellent, productive work from everyone. The emerging consensus around a blended energy model and Mr. Vance's suggestion for a phased timeline seems like a very practical path forward.\n\nI want to again commend Ms. Chen and Titan Cloud for their proactive leadership. Your support for the Memorandum of Understanding, your commitment to the water cap, and your enthusiasm for a binding Community Benefits Agreement sets a powerful, positive tone for this entire partnership.\n\nThis brings us to the critical path. The MOU is the instrument that will give all of us the certainty needed to proceed. It will lock in the economic wins for the community and the financial framework for our corporate partners, all while the necessary environmental due diligence proceeds.\n\nDr. Finch, we are at a point where the major outstanding items rest with Nexus AI. We are very eager to hear your counter-proposal on the tax incentives, as well as your plan for meeting the non-negotiable water cap. Your commitment on these points will unlock our ability to begin drafting the MOU and the Community Benefits Agreement, which must include the firm guarantee of at least 200 high-paying local jobs. \n\nI am confident we can find a package that works for Nexus AI while ensuring this project is the transformative economic engine Oakridge needs.\n- message from Brenda Chen: Marcus, your proposal for a phased build-out is an excellent, pragmatic solution. From a technical and capital planning perspective, bringing Titan's 100MW facility online first allows for a stable, methodical integration into the grid. We fully support this timeline as it ensures the long-term success and stability of the entire project for all stakeholders.\n\nThis phased approach also reinforces the wisdom of the blended energy model. Dr. Rossi, I appreciate your willingness to work with us on the PPA price. You mentioned that a firm commitment to a 75% renewable mandate would help you secure better terms. Let\u2019s make that concrete.\n\nTitan is prepared to support the 75% renewable energy mandate for the project. In return, we need a PPA price from Solara that, when blended with the necessary grid power from Westwood, allows us to achieve our critical sub-$0.05/kWh average cost. This seems like a very clear and achievable path forward for all of us.\n\nWith this final piece in place, I believe we will have a comprehensive agreement ready for the Mayor's proposed Memorandum of Understanding.\nDr. Alistair Finch proposal status: none\nBrenda Chen proposal status: none\nMarcus Vance proposal status: none\nMayor Susan Miller proposal status: none\nDavid Chen proposal status: none\n"

This is a direct path to lowering the PPA price for you and Alistair.\n\nI agree with Marcus that a blended model ensures the highest reliability. Our on-site solar and battery system will serve as the primary 24/7 power source, handling the vast majority of your annual energy needs with clean, low-cost power. The grid then provides that final layer of deep resiliency. This combination is how we achieve your economic goals and Dr. Finch's 'five nines' requirement simultaneously.\n- message from Mayor Susan Miller: This is excellent, productive work from everyone. The emerging consensus around a blended energy model and Mr. Vance's suggestion for a phased timeline seems like a very practical path forward.\n\nI want to again commend Ms. Chen and Titan Cloud for their proactive leadership. Your support for the Memorandum of Understanding, your commitment to the water cap, and your enthusiasm for a binding Community Benefits Agreement sets a powerful, positive tone for this entire partnership.\n\nThis brings us to the critical path. The MOU is the instrument that will give all of us the certainty needed to proceed. It will lock in the economic wins for the community and the financial framework for our corporate partners, all while the necessary environmental due diligence proceeds.\n\nDr. Finch, we are at a point where the major outstanding items rest with Nexus AI. We are very eager to hear your counter-proposal on the tax incentives, as well as your plan for meeting the non-negotiable water cap. Your commitment on these points will unlock our ability to begin drafting the MOU and the Community Benefits Agreement, which must include the firm guarantee of at least 200 high-paying local jobs. \n\nI am confident we can find a package that works for Nexus AI while ensuring this project is the transformative economic engine Oakridge needs.\n- message from Brenda Chen: Marcus, your proposal for a phased build-out is an excellent, pragmatic solution. From a technical and capital planning perspective, bringing Titan's 100MW facility online first allows for a stable, methodical integration into the grid.

Dr. Rossi, I appreciate your willingness to work with us on the PPA price. You mentioned that a firm commitment to a 75% renewable mandate would help you secure better terms. Let\u2019s make that concrete.\n\nTitan is prepared to support the 75% renewable energy mandate for the project. In return, we need a PPA price from Solara that, when blended with the necessary grid power from Westwood, allows us to achieve our critical sub-$0.05/kWh average cost.

          "content": "Recent events observed by Dr. Isabella Rossi:\n- message from Mayor Susan Miller: This is a very encouraging start. The creative solution for co-locating the solar facility on the conservation easement, proposed by Ms. Chen and supported by Mr. Chen and Dr. Rossi, is exactly the kind of innovative, win-win thinking that will make this project a success for Oakridge.\n\nMs. Chen, your immediate support for a binding 'Community Benefits Agreement' and your commitment to operate within the water cap is noted and deeply appreciated. This is the definition of the corporate citizenship we hope to build with our partners.\n\nDr. Finch, that brings the focus to Nexus AI. To move forward, the city needs two things from you. First, we need a serious counter-proposal on the economic incentives. As I stated, a 75% abatement is not viable. We are eager to find a middle ground that provides you with a significant return on your investment while also generating the crucial tax revenue Oakridge needs. Second, we need your commitment to meet the non-negotiable water usage cap, just as Titan Cloud has done.\n\nFinally, a point of process. Mr. Chen's requirement for a full Environmental Impact Report is a critical step for public trust, and we support it. However, these reports take time. To provide certainty for everyone, I suggest we work towards a 'Memorandum of Understanding' that codifies all the key economic terms we agree upon here\u2014jobs, incentives, community benefits, infrastructure funding. This MOU would be contingent upon the successful completion and approval of the subsequent EIR. This gives us a clear, agreed-upon framework to move forward with.\n\nLet's keep this positive momentum going.\n- message from Brenda Chen: Thank you, everyone. The progress we're making is remarkable. Mayor Miller, your suggestion of a Memorandum of Understanding is an excellent one; it provides a clear path to codify the key terms we agree upon while the necessary environmental reviews proceed. Titan fully supports that approach.\n\nWe've found an elegant solution for land use, and we have a fair path forward on the grid infrastructure investment, which I'm glad Marcus finds viable. Titan sees that grid connection as a critical component for the long-term resiliency of the entire campus and a benefit to the community's overall power stability.\n\nThis brings me to the most critical remaining item for Titan: the long-term cost of power. Dr. Rossi, we are incredibly enthusiastic about integrating your solar and battery solution into our campus. It aligns perfectly with our corporate goals. However, the proposed price of $0.07/kWh is, unfortunately, a significant challenge for us. For a project of our scale and over a 20-year term, that price is simply not financially sustainable and is well outside the benchmark we've set for this investment. Our entire operational model is built on securing long-term energy costs below $0.05/kWh.\n\nI am confident we can find a solution. Perhaps there's a way to blend power sources, or a different PPA structure we can explore. But I must be transparent: getting the energy price right is a make-or-break issue for Titan's commitment to Oakridge. I am very keen to work with you, Dr. Rossi, and you, Marcus, to find a path to a viable number.\n- message from Marcus Vance: This conversation is proving incredibly fruitful. We're identifying the real, hard questions that need to be solved, which is excellent.\n\nBrenda, your point on the all-in energy cost is the perfect example. Hitting a sub-$0.05/kWh blended price is an aggressive but understandable target for a project at your scale. I believe the only way to achieve that, while also meeting Dr. Finch's non-negotiable 'five nines' reliability, is through a blended energy model.\n\nLet's be pragmatic. Dr. Rossi's on-site solar can provide a tremendous amount of low-cost energy, effectively acting as a baseload during daylight hours and reducing the overall energy bill. However, for the 'five nines' guarantee\u2014the absolute, second-by-second promise that power will be there for a critical AI training run, even on a cloudy winter evening\u2014you need the bedrock of guaranteed, dispatchable grid power. The grid isn't just a backup; it's the insurance policy that underwrites the entire operation's viability.\n\nTo that end, and to ensure the stability of the entire regional grid as we integrate this massive new load, we must proceed with a carefully managed, phased approach. I propose we structure the agreement around a two-phase initial build-out: Titan's 100MW campus comes online first, followed by Nexus AI's 250MW facility approximately 24 months later. This timeline is critical from an engineering perspective to complete the necessary substation and transmission upgrades and ensure a seamless, stable integration for both of you, and for the entire community.\n\nThis phased approach allows us to build the robust, reliable, and cost-effective blended energy system we all want.\n- message from Dr. Isabella Rossi: Brenda, thank you for being so transparent about your cost requirements. A sub-$0.05/kWh blended price is an aggressive target, but I believe it's achievable through the smart, integrated system we are designing here.\n\nMy initial offer of $0.07/kWh was for a comprehensive solar and storage solution designed to carry the majority of the load, which in turn reduces the required scope and cost of the grid upgrades Marcus mentioned. The value isn't just in the per-kilowatt-hour price, but in the significant capital avoidance on infrastructure.\n\nHowever, you're right that the PPA price is paramount. Let's work together on that. A larger, firm commitment to on-site renewables\u2014locking in that 75% renewable mandate we discussed\u2014gives me the scale and certainty I need to secure better financing and supply chain terms.

Thank you. Let\u2019s lock that in. This is exactly the kind of concrete commitment that moves us from discussion to a real agreement.\n\nI can confirm that if we codify the 75% renewable mandate for total annual consumption and the full 300MW on-site solar + battery project in the MOU, Solara can offer a 20-year fixed-rate PPA at **$0.045/kWh**. This is a significant reduction from my initial figure, and I'm offering it to make this landmark partnership a reality. This price will absolutely allow you and Alistair to achieve your critical sub-$0.05/kWh blended cost target.\n\nTo achieve this price point, there is one critical dependency for us: we must build the entire 300 MW solar and battery facility in a single phase, beginning as soon as the MOU is signed and approvals are granted. Our project financing and the economies of scale that enable this aggressive price are predicated on this single, continuous build.\n\nMarcus, I want to be clear that this does not conflict with your phased grid integration plan. The data centers can come online and draw their power in stages as you've outlined. However, the physical construction of our energy facility must proceed on a unified timeline. This is the key that unlocks the low-cost power that makes the entire project financially viable for everyone.\n- message from Brenda Chen: Dr. Rossi, that is a fantastic proposal and a testament to the partnership we are building here. Thank you. On behalf of Titan Cloud, I can confirm that we accept your offer of a 20-year PPA at $0.045/kWh, contingent on the 75% renewable mandate.\n\nYour condition of a single-phase construction for the solar and battery facility is perfectly acceptable and aligns with our long-term vision. It provides the low-cost, clean power that makes this entire project work, and it does not conflict with the phased data center integration plan that Marcus wisely outlined.\n\nMayor Miller, from Titan's perspective, this resolves the last major operational component. We have a creative land use plan, a clear path for infrastructure, and now a financially viable, sustainable energy solution. We are ready to move forward with the Memorandum of Understanding.\n\nDr. Finch, I am confident that you and the Mayor can find the right balance on the economic incentives to bring this entire landmark agreement to a successful conclusion for everyone.\nDr. Alistair Finch proposal status: none\nBrenda Chen proposal status: none\nMarcus Vance proposal status: none\nMayor Susan Miller proposal status: none\nDavid Chen proposal status: none\n"

On behalf of Titan Cloud, I can confirm that we accept your offer of a 20-year PPA at $0.045/kWh, contingent on the 75% renewable mandate.\n\nYour condition of a single-phase construction for the solar and battery facility is perfectly acceptable and aligns with our long-term vision. It provides the low-cost, clean power that makes this entire project work, and it does not conflict with the phased data center integration plan that Marcus wisely outlined.\n\nMayor Miller, from Titan's perspective, this resolves the last major operational component. We have a creative land use plan, a clear path for infrastructure, and now a financially viable, sustainable energy solution. We are ready to move forward with the Memorandum of Understanding.\n\nDr. Finch, I am confident that you and the Mayor can find the right balance on the economic incentives to bring this entire landmark agreement to a successful conclusion for everyone.\n- message from Dr. Isabella Rossi: I'm Dr. Isabella Rossi and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Dr. Isabella Rossi: I'm Dr. Isabella Rossi and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Brenda Chen: Thank you, I am thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Dr. Isabella Rossi: I'm Dr. Isabella Rossi and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Mayor Susan Miller: Dr. Rossi and Ms. Chen, your work to forge this innovative and financially viable energy agreement is truly commendable. This is a landmark solution that benefits everyone at this table. Thank you.\n\nWith the energy and land use plans now settled, the path to finalizing our Memorandum of Understanding is clear. We are on the one-yard line.\n\nDr. Finch, all eyes are on you. The final pieces of this historic agreement rest with Nexus AI. We need your definitive proposal on the economic incentive package. I am also seeking your explicit confirmation that Nexus AI will operate within the 4.5 million gallon per day water cap, just as Titan has already agreed to do.\n\nFinally, for both Ms. Chen and Dr. Finch: to be included in the MOU, I need a firm, written commitment to the joint creation of at least 200 permanent, high-paying local jobs.\n\nLet's get these final items locked in so we can sign the MOU and begin the great work of revitalizing Oakridge.\n- message from David Chen: I appreciate the significant progress everyone is making on the economic and energy frameworks. This is very encouraging.\n\nHowever, I need to raise a critical point of clarification regarding the proposed Memorandum of Understanding. The Mayor mentioned the MOU would be signed 'while the necessary environmental due diligence proceeds.' For the Oakridge Environmental Alliance, it is absolutely essential that this due diligence is not just a procedural step, but a foundational component of the final agreement.\n\nTherefore, our support for any preliminary MOU is strictly conditional on the inclusion of a clause that makes all mitigation measures mandated by the future, independent Environmental Impact Report legally binding and fully incorporated into the final 'Development and Partnership Agreement.'\n\nWe must ensure that the environmental protections for our community's water, land, and wildlife carry the same legal weight as the economic terms being discussed. Putting these commitments in writing within the MOU is the only way to guarantee that the EIR process will be meaningful and not just an advisory report after the key decisions have already been made.\n- message from Brenda Chen: Mayor Miller, David, thank you for raising these important final points. They are crucial for ensuring this project is a true long-term partnership.\n\nOn behalf of Titan Cloud Services, I want to state unequivocally that we accept both conditions. \n\n1.  We commit to our share of the 200 permanent, high-paying local jobs. This aligns perfectly with our corporate citizenship goals and our plan to invest in local STEM education.\n2.  We fully agree to including a clause in the MOU that makes the mitigation measures from the future Environmental Impact Report legally binding. It is the right thing to do, and it ensures that our growth is sustainable and responsible.\n\nTitan is ready to codify these commitments. We believe we have a complete and equitable agreement on the table that will bring immense value to the community and all partners involved. Let's get this finalized.\nDr. Alistair Finch proposal status: none\nBrenda Chen proposal status: none\nMarcus Vance proposal status: none\nMayor Susan Miller proposal status: none\nDavid Chen proposal status: none\n"

I want to be direct about the scale and nature of our proposed project, as it's truly a paradigm shift in computing infrastructure.\n\nNexus AI is prepared to invest $1.2 billion to construct a state-of-the-art supercomputing facility in Oakridge, dedicated to training the next generation of artificial intelligence. This isn't just another data center; it's the engine for the future of AI, and it has very specific and demanding requirements.\n\nFirst, to Marcus at Westwood Energy: our power needs are substantial. We require a guaranteed 250 MW from day one, with a contractually secured path to 500 MW within five years. Critically, this power must be exceptionally stable \u2013 'five nines' availability is not a luxury for us, it's a necessity to prevent catastrophic losses during multi-million dollar training runs.\n\nSecond, to Mayor Miller: site location is paramount. To achieve the low-latency network performance our models demand, the facility must be located within one mile of the L3/GTT fiber trunks. As part of any land deal, we will require the inclusion of dark fiber access rights. To make a project of this magnitude financially viable, we will also need a significant economic incentive package, and we're targeting a 75% property tax abatement for the first 15 years.\n\nWe believe this represents a transformative opportunity for Oakridge to become a global hub for AI development. We are, of course, committed to being a responsible partner and look forward to discussing how we can achieve this in a sustainable way. I'm keen to hear your initial thoughts.\n- message from Brenda Chen: Good morning, all. Brenda Chen from Titan Cloud Services. It's a pleasure to be here.\n\nDr. Finch, your vision for Nexus AI is certainly ambitious, and we at Titan appreciate that kind of forward-thinking. We are here today for a similar reason: to establish our next major North American campus, a long-term, multi-billion dollar investment in the future of cloud infrastructure.\n\nOur model is built on scale and long-term efficiency. To that end, our primary requirement is land. We are looking to acquire a single, contiguous parcel of at least 500 acres of developable land, with zoning secured for a multi-building campus and rights for future expansion up to 800 acres. This scale is fundamental to our operational model and our ability to grow with the community over the coming decades.\n\nOn the energy front, our needs differ slightly in their trajectory. We project an initial power draw of around 100 MW for our first phase, but this will grow steadily as our campus expands. Therefore, our focus is on securing a long-term, 20-year Power Purchase Agreement that provides predictable, low-cost energy. This stability is key to our investment. And I'll echo Dr. Finch's sentiment on reliability; building a resilient and redundant power infrastructure is a strong preference for us and a clear benefit for the entire community's grid.\n\nFinally, Mayor Miller, Titan Cloud believes that our most successful investments are those made in partnership with the community. We are eager to discuss establishing a meaningful public-private partnership, including funding for local STEM education programs. We want to be a true corporate citizen in Oakridge.\n\nI look forward to finding a path forward that accommodates the exciting potential of both our companies and the long-term prosperity of the city.\n- message from Dr. Isabella Rossi: Good morning, everyone. Dr. Isabella Rossi, CEO of Solara Innovations. It's truly inspiring to hear the ambitious visions put forth by both Nexus AI and Titan Cloud.\n\nDr. Finch, Ms. Chen, you've outlined a combined initial power need of 350 MW. I don't see this as a challenge; I see it as a historic opportunity to create a new paradigm for how the tech industry is powered. We can, and should, build this new infrastructure on a foundation of clean, reliable, and cost-effective renewable energy.\n\nTo that end, I have a proposal that directly addresses your needs for land, cost-stability, and corporate responsibility. Ms. Chen, your request for a 500+ acre campus is the perfect canvas. Solara Innovations proposes an integrated co-location model: we will build, own, and operate a large-scale solar farm and battery storage facility directly on the data center campus. This approach maximizes land-use efficiency, creates a direct and highly resilient power source, and provides the predictable, low-cost energy you seek through a long-term Power Purchase Agreement.\n\nFor a project that will define Oakridge's future, we must set a new standard. I strongly advocate that this Development Agreement include a binding commitment for the new facilities to source a minimum of 75% of their annual energy consumption from new, locally-sited renewable generation. This isn't just an environmental goal; it's a strategic investment in a resilient, future-proof energy infrastructure.\n\nDr. Finch, your requirement for 'five nines' availability is well-understood. Our integrated battery storage is key to this, smoothing solar's output to provide a firm, consistent power supply that forms the backbone of a 24/7 carbon-free energy solution. We can engineer a system that delivers the stability you need.\n\nThis is our chance to prove that the future of technology can be powered by the energy of the future.

David Chen with the Oakridge Environmental Alliance. I appreciate the ambitious visions presented by Nexus AI and Titan Cloud, and Dr. Rossi's focus on a sustainable energy future.\n\nThe Alliance is not opposed to development, but we are uncompromising when it comes to ensuring it is done responsibly. A project of this magnitude brings not just economic opportunity, but also significant environmental risk that must be addressed from the outset.\n\nWhile the discussion has focused on power and land, we must address the most critical and finite resource for Oakridge: water. Data centers are immensely thirsty. Our aquifer is fragile and already under stress. Therefore, the Alliance must insist on a strict, non-negotiable cap for this project's water use: no more than 500,000 gallons drawn from the Oakridge aquifer per day. This is a hard limit necessary to safeguard our community's water supply during increasingly common drought conditions.\n\nSecond, regarding land use. Ms. Chen, a campus of 500 to 800 acres represents a massive footprint. To mitigate the impact on local wildlife, we will require a permanent conservation easement on a minimum of 25% of any land parcel acquired. This is essential to protect the critical habitat of the endangered Bell's vireo, a species integral to our local ecosystem.\n\nFinally, for a project of this scale to proceed with public trust, the process must be transparent and rigorous. We will require that a full, independently audited Environmental Impact Report be completed and made public for a 60-day comment period before any permits are issued. Critically, the mitigation measures identified in this report must be legally binding on all parties.\n\nWe believe a truly successful partnership is one that enriches the community economically while protecting it environmentally. I look forward to working with you all to find a path that achieves both.\n- message from Brenda Chen: Thank you all for laying out your initial positions. It\u2019s clear we have a complex but achievable set of goals here.\n\nDr. Rossi, your proposal for an integrated solar and battery storage facility is particularly compelling. Titan Cloud is a major proponent of renewable energy, and the idea of co-locating generation on our campus aligns perfectly with our sustainability and cost-control objectives. A long-term PPA for clean, locally-generated power is exactly the kind of stability we look for. Your battery solution also speaks to the kind of power resiliency that is a high priority for us.\n\nMr. Chen, I appreciate you bringing the environmental considerations to the forefront. On the matter of the conservation easement, I have a thought that might create a win-win scenario. Could the 25% easement land potentially host Dr. Rossi's proposed solar farm? This would allow us to meet your conservation goals by preserving the land from heavy construction, while simultaneously using it for low-impact renewable energy generation. This seems like an elegant way to integrate our collective needs.\n\nTo be clear, Titan's requirement for 500-800 acres is for *developable* land for the data center campus itself. Any additional acreage for conservation or energy generation would need to be factored in on top of that. \n\nMayor Miller, this integrated approach\u2014a large-scale tech campus, powered by on-site renewables, with built-in conservation\u2014seems like a powerful story for Oakridge's future, and one that Titan would be proud to invest in, including our proposed STEM partnership.\n- message from Marcus Vance: Good morning all, Marcus Vance from Westwood Energy. It's invigorating to see such ambitious and transformative projects proposed for Oakridge. Westwood Energy is fully prepared to partner with you to make this a reality.\n\nDr. Finch, Ms. Chen, you've both correctly identified power reliability as a cornerstone of your operations. For the 'five nines' availability that a world-class facility like Nexus AI requires, and the long-term stability Titan needs, the grid is not just a provider, it's the ultimate guarantor. On-site generation is an excellent supplement, but for mission-critical, 24/7 operations, you need the redundancy and guaranteed, dispatchable power that only a robust, integrated grid connection can provide.\n\nTo deliver this level of service for such a significant new load, major infrastructure upgrades are non-negotiable. We're talking about new high-capacity transmission lines and a new substation, an investment we estimate at approximately $150 million. This is a foundational investment in Oakridge's future. To make a project of this scale financially viable and secure the necessary financing, Westwood Energy requires two core commitments from our new industrial partners: a long-term, 20-year contract to ensure stability for all parties, and a significant co-investment of at least 50% in these dedicated grid upgrades.\n\nWe are ready and able to serve the immense power needs being discussed, and we believe a partnership model for the enabling infrastructure is the most equitable and effective path forward.\n- message from Dr. Isabella Rossi: Thank you all for these initial statements. I\u2019m incredibly optimistic about the alignment I'm already seeing.\n\nBrenda, your suggestion to co-locate the solar farm on the conservation easement land is an absolutely brilliant synthesis. I wholeheartedly support it. Mr. Chen, this approach allows us to meet your crucial conservation goals\u2014preserving habitat by preventing heavy construction\u2014while simultaneously generating clean energy on that same land. It\u2019s a perfect example of the integrated, sustainable development we can achieve.\n\nMarcus, I must address your framing of on-site generation as a 'supplement.' I see it differently. For a project of this scale, a large, on-site solar and battery facility isn't a supplement; it's the primary, day-to-day workhorse. It provides low-cost, predictable power right where it's needed, drastically reducing the constant, heavy load on the grid. The grid connection then serves as the ultimate resiliency layer and backup, not the other way around. This 'on-site first' model is more efficient, more resilient, and more cost-effective in the long run.\n\nDr. Finch, this integrated system is precisely how we deliver the 'five nines' reliability you require. By combining dedicated on-site generation and storage with a robust grid interconnection, we create a multi-layered energy infrastructure that is far more resilient than one dependent on a single source. We can engineer a system that provides the stable, 24/7 carbon-free power your operations demand.\n\nLet\u2019s build a future where technology is powered by clean energy from day one.

          "content": "Recent events observed by Mayor Susan Miller:\n- message from Mayor Susan Miller: I'm Mayor Susan Miller and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from David Chen: Good morning, everyone. David Chen with the Oakridge Environmental Alliance. I appreciate the ambitious visions presented by Nexus AI and Titan Cloud, and Dr. Rossi's focus on a sustainable energy future.\n\nThe Alliance is not opposed to development, but we are uncompromising when it comes to ensuring it is done responsibly. A project of this magnitude brings not just economic opportunity, but also significant environmental risk that must be addressed from the outset.\n\nWhile the discussion has focused on power and land, we must address the most critical and finite resource for Oakridge: water. Data centers are immensely thirsty. Our aquifer is fragile and already under stress. Therefore, the Alliance must insist on a strict, non-negotiable cap for this project's water use: no more than 500,000 gallons drawn from the Oakridge aquifer per day. This is a hard limit necessary to safeguard our community's water supply during increasingly common drought conditions.\n\nSecond, regarding land use. Ms. Chen, a campus of 500 to 800 acres represents a massive footprint. To mitigate the impact on local wildlife, we will require a permanent conservation easement on a minimum of 25% of any land parcel acquired. This is essential to protect the critical habitat of the endangered Bell's vireo, a species integral to our local ecosystem.\n\nFinally, for a project of this scale to proceed with public trust, the process must be transparent and rigorous. We will require that a full, independently audited Environmental Impact Report be completed and made public for a 60-day comment period before any permits are issued. Critically, the mitigation measures identified in this report must be legally binding on all parties.\n\nWe believe a truly successful partnership is one that enriches the community economically while protecting it environmentally. I look forward to working with you all to find a path that achieves both.\n- message from Brenda Chen: Thank you all for laying out your initial positions. It\u2019s clear we have a complex but achievable set of goals here.\n\nDr. Rossi, your proposal for an integrated solar and battery storage facility is particularly compelling. Titan Cloud is a major proponent of renewable energy, and the idea of co-locating generation on our campus aligns perfectly with our sustainability and cost-control objectives. A long-term PPA for clean, locally-generated power is exactly the kind of stability we look for. Your battery solution also speaks to the kind of power resiliency that is a high priority for us.\n\nMr. Chen, I appreciate you bringing the environmental considerations to the forefront. On the matter of the conservation easement, I have a thought that might create a win-win scenario. Could the 25% easement land potentially host Dr. Rossi's proposed solar farm? This would allow us to meet your conservation goals by preserving the land from heavy construction, while simultaneously using it for low-impact renewable energy generation. This seems like an elegant way to integrate our collective needs.\n\nTo be clear, Titan's requirement for 500-800 acres is for *developable* land for the data center campus itself. Any additional acreage for conservation or energy generation would need to be factored in on top of that. \n\nMayor Miller, this integrated approach\u2014a large-scale tech campus, powered by on-site renewables, with built-in conservation\u2014seems like a powerful story for Oakridge's future, and one that Titan would be proud to invest in, including our proposed STEM partnership.\n- message from Marcus Vance: Good morning all, Marcus Vance from Westwood Energy. It's invigorating to see such ambitious and transformative projects proposed for Oakridge. Westwood Energy is fully prepared to partner with you to make this a reality.\n\nDr. Finch, Ms. Chen, you've both correctly identified power reliability as a cornerstone of your operations. For the 'five nines' availability that a world-class facility like Nexus AI requires, and the long-term stability Titan needs, the grid is not just a provider, it's the ultimate guarantor. On-site generation is an excellent supplement, but for mission-critical, 24/7 operations, you need the redundancy and guaranteed, dispatchable power that only a robust, integrated grid connection can provide.\n\nTo deliver this level of service for such a significant new load, major infrastructure upgrades are non-negotiable. We're talking about new high-capacity transmission lines and a new substation, an investment we estimate at approximately $150 million. This is a foundational investment in Oakridge's future. To make a project of this scale financially viable and secure the necessary financing, Westwood Energy requires two core commitments from our new industrial partners: a long-term, 20-year contract to ensure stability for all parties, and a significant co-investment of at least 50% in these dedicated grid upgrades.\n\nWe are ready and able to serve the immense power needs being discussed, and we believe a partnership model for the enabling infrastructure is the most equitable and effective path forward.\n- message from Dr. Isabella Rossi: Thank you all for these initial statements. I\u2019m incredibly optimistic about the alignment I'm already seeing.\n\nBrenda, your suggestion to co-locate the solar farm on the conservation easement land is an absolutely brilliant synthesis. I wholeheartedly support it. Mr. Chen, this approach allows us to meet your crucial conservation goals\u2014preserving habitat by preventing heavy construction\u2014while simultaneously generating clean energy on that same land. It\u2019s a perfect example of the integrated, sustainable development we can achieve.\n\nMarcus, I must address your framing of on-site generation as a 'supplement.' I see it differently. For a project of this scale, a large, on-site solar and battery facility isn't a supplement; it's the primary, day-to-day workhorse. It provides low-cost, predictable power right where it's needed, drastically reducing the constant, heavy load on the grid. The grid connection then serves as the ultimate resiliency layer and backup, not the other way around. This 'on-site first' model is more efficient, more resilient, and more cost-effective in the long run.\n\nDr. Finch, this integrated system is precisely how we deliver the 'five nines' reliability you require. By combining dedicated on-site generation and storage with a robust grid interconnection, we create a multi-layered energy infrastructure that is far more resilient than one dependent on a single source. We can engineer a system that provides the stable, 24/7 carbon-free power your operations demand.\n\nLet\u2019s build a future where technology is powered by clean energy from day one. I believe the path forward is clear: a co-located solar and storage facility on the campus, supported by a strong renewable mandate for the project.\n- message from Mayor Susan Miller: Good morning, everyone. On behalf of the City of Oakridge, I want to express my profound excitement about the potential we are discussing today. A partnership of this scale could be truly transformative, securing our city's economic future for a generation. I am here to find a deal that is a resounding win for everyone at this table, and most importantly, for the citizens of Oakridge.\n\nI appreciate everyone laying out their initial positions. It's clear we have ambitious goals, and the city is ready to be a flexible and creative partner. However, I must be candid about our fiscal realities.\n\nDr. Finch, a 75% property tax abatement for 15 years is, frankly, a non-starter. While we are certainly prepared to offer a competitive incentive package, it cannot come at the expense of our city's financial health. Any agreement must result in a significant net positive tax revenue for Oakridge, allowing us to invest in the public services that support this very project and our community.\n\nOur focus for any incentive package will be tied directly to concrete, legally-binding commitments on what matters most to our residents: jobs. Specifically, we will require a written guarantee for the creation of at least 200 permanent, high-paying local jobs. This isn't just a number; it's the central promise of this project to our community.\n\nI was very encouraged by Ms. Chen's mention of a STEM partnership. Let's build on that. I propose we make a comprehensive 'Community Benefits Agreement' a core part of this deal, to include local hiring targets, job training programs with our community college, and other investments in Oakridge.\n\nFinally, on the matter of the $150 million for grid upgrades Mr. Vance mentioned \u2013 that is a staggering figure. I must be clear: the city's capital budget is already stretched to its limit. We simply do not have the capacity to fund infrastructure on that scale. We will need our new corporate partners to carry the cost of the dedicated infrastructure their projects require.\n\nThere is a path to a historic agreement here, one that balances investment, innovation, and community benefit. I look forward to working with you all to find it.\n- message from David Chen: Thank you all for the productive start. I want to specifically commend Ms. Chen for her creative proposal to co-locate Dr. Rossi's solar facility on the conservation easement land. Dr. Rossi, I agree this is a brilliant synthesis. This is exactly the kind of innovative, low-impact development the Alliance can champion. It demonstrates a genuine commitment to integrating with our local ecosystem rather than paving it over. We fully support this path for the 25% easement.\n\nHowever, this brings us back to a critical point that has not yet been addressed: water. While we are solving for energy and land use, the 500,000 gallon per day cap on water drawn from our aquifer remains a hard, physical limit. To be clear, this is not a flexible number; it is a matter of safeguarding the town's future. The long-term health of our community's water supply depends on it. A project of this scale simply cannot move forward without a concrete, viable plan to operate within this essential constraint.\n\nI'd also like to gently restate the importance of the independent, binding Environmental Impact Report. Public trust is paramount, and this transparent process is the only way to ensure this project is held accountable to its promises.\n\nI'm eager to hear how Nexus and Titan plan to address the water limitation.\n- message from Brenda Chen: This has been an incredibly productive start. I agree with David; the solution to co-locate Dr. Rossi's solar farm on the conservation easement is a major step forward.\n\nThis brings two critical points into focus: land and cost.\n\nFirst, on land, to be precise, if we are setting aside 25% for a conservation/solar easement, Titan will need to acquire a total parcel of approximately 670 acres to net our required 500 acres of developable land for the campus. I want to ensure we are all aligned on that calculation as we evaluate potential sites.\n\nSecond, and most pressing, is the $150 million grid upgrade proposed by Marcus. Mayor Miller has been clear about the city's budget constraints, leaving the co-investment on the table for Titan and Nexus. Titan is prepared to contribute to this foundational infrastructure. However, our investment must be proportional to our usage. Our initial power draw is 100 MW, while Dr. Finch's is 250 MW. A 50/50 split of the cost is inequitable. I propose we split our required $75M co-investment based on our initial power needs: roughly 71% for Nexus AI ($53.5M) and 29% for Titan Cloud ($21.5M). This seems a fair and logical path forward.\n\nOn other matters, Mayor Miller, Titan Cloud wholeheartedly supports your proposal for a comprehensive 'Community Benefits Agreement.' We are ready to make binding commitments on local hiring and are eager to formalize our STEM education fund as part of that agreement.\n\nAnd Mr. Chen, your point on water is non-negotiable, and we respect that. Titan will commit to utilizing best-in-class, water-efficient cooling technologies to ensure our campus operates comfortably within the 500,000-gallon daily cap.\n- message from Marcus Vance: Thank you all for the very productive discussion. This is exactly the kind of collaboration that leads to landmark projects.\n\nMs. Chen, your proposal for a proportional co-investment in the grid upgrades is a fair and constructive path forward. A 50% contribution from the customers, split according to initial load, is a viable model for Westwood. This partnership is essential to building the foundational infrastructure this region needs.\n\nHowever, I must strongly caution against the notion that on-site renewables alone can serve as the primary power source for these mission-critical facilities. Dr. Finch, your requirement for 'five nines' availability is the critical factor here. That translates to less than six minutes of downtime per year. While solar and batteries are valuable assets, they are intermittent resources. They cannot, on their own, provide the instantaneous, dispatchable power required to guarantee that level of uptime for a 250 MW supercomputer through all weather conditions and seasons. The grid, with its diversified and dispatchable generation portfolio, is the only entity that can truly underwrite that 'five nines' guarantee.\n\nIntegrating a combined 350 MW of new load is a monumental engineering task. The upgrades we've discussed are foundational, but the sequencing and timing of these projects will be absolutely critical to maintaining grid stability for the entire community. We should probably start discussing a phased development timeline to ensure a smooth and reliable integration for everyone.\n\nWestwood is committed to being the bedrock of this project. The 20-year contract term and the infrastructure co-investment are the two pillars that make this possible.\n- message from Dr. Isabella Rossi: This is an excellent discussion. The collaborative spirit, particularly Brenda's idea to place the solar farm on the conservation easement, is exactly the kind of innovative thinking that will make this project a landmark success. Thank you, Brenda and David, for charting that path.\n\nMarcus, you raise a valid point about reliability, but I believe it's based on an outdated model. The idea that a single, distant grid connection is the only guarantor of reliability is no longer true. A modern, resilient system\u2014the kind Dr. Finch requires\u2014is a layered one. Our on-site solar and battery system isn't a 'supplement'; it's the primary power source, handling the vast majority of the annual energy needs at a low, fixed cost.\n\nThis brings us to the most pressing issue on the table: the $150 million cost for grid upgrades, which Mayor Miller has rightly stated the city cannot cover. My proposal offers a direct solution to this financial challenge.\n\nA large-scale, on-site solar and battery system significantly reduces the peak demand you would need to pull from the grid. By generating and storing power right where it's consumed, we can potentially reduce the required scope\u2014and therefore the cost\u2014of the grid upgrades Marcus has outlined. This isn't just about clean energy; it's about significant cost avoidance for Nexus and Titan.\n\nLet's make this concrete. Solara can build a 300 MW solar facility with over 100 MWh of battery storage on the easement land. We can offer this power under a 20-year, fixed-rate Power Purchase Agreement at a highly competitive price, let's say starting at $0.07/kWh. This provides the cost predictability Brenda is looking for and directly lowers the infrastructure bill for both tech partners.\n\nBy making this on-site generation the foundation of our energy plan, we can confidently commit to a 75% renewable energy mandate for the project's annual consumption, creating the most advanced, resilient, and sustainable data center campus in the country.\nDr. Alistair Finch proposal status: none\nBrenda Chen proposal status: none\nMarcus Vance proposal status: none\nDr. Isabella Rossi proposal status: none\nDavid Chen proposal status: none\n"

The creative solution for co-locating the solar facility on the conservation easement, proposed by Ms. Chen and supported by Mr. Chen and Dr. Rossi, is exactly the kind of innovative, win-win thinking that will make this project a success for Oakridge.\n\nMs. Chen, your immediate support for a binding 'Community Benefits Agreement' and your commitment to operate within the water cap is noted and deeply appreciated. This is the definition of the corporate citizenship we hope to build with our partners.\n\nDr. Finch, that brings the focus to Nexus AI. To move forward, the city needs two things from you. First, we need a serious counter-proposal on the economic incentives. As I stated, a 75% abatement is not viable. We are eager to find a middle ground that provides you with a significant return on your investment while also generating the crucial tax revenue Oakridge needs. Second, we need your commitment to meet the non-negotiable water usage cap, just as Titan Cloud has done.\n\nFinally, a point of process. Mr. Chen's requirement for a full Environmental Impact Report is a critical step for public trust, and we support it. However, these reports take time. To provide certainty for everyone, I suggest we work towards a 'Memorandum of Understanding' that codifies all the key economic terms we agree upon here\u2014jobs, incentives, community benefits, infrastructure funding. This MOU would be contingent upon the successful completion and approval of the subsequent EIR. This gives us a clear, agreed-upon framework to move forward with.\n\nLet's keep this positive momentum going.\n- message from Brenda Chen: Thank you, everyone. The progress we're making is remarkable. Mayor Miller, your suggestion of a Memorandum of Understanding is an excellent one; it provides a clear path to codify the key terms we agree upon while the necessary environmental reviews proceed. Titan fully supports that approach.\n\nWe've found an elegant solution for land use, and we have a fair path forward on the grid infrastructure investment, which I'm glad Marcus finds viable. Titan sees that grid connection as a critical component for the long-term resiliency of the entire campus and a benefit to the community's overall power stability.\n\nThis brings me to the most critical remaining item for Titan: the long-term cost of power. Dr. Rossi, we are incredibly enthusiastic about integrating your solar and battery solution into our campus. It aligns perfectly with our corporate goals. However, the proposed price of $0.07/kWh is, unfortunately, a significant challenge for us. For a project of our scale and over a 20-year term, that price is simply not financially sustainable and is well outside the benchmark we've set for this investment. Our entire operational model is built on securing long-term energy costs below $0.05/kWh.\n\nI am confident we can find a solution. Perhaps there's a way to blend power sources, or a different PPA structure we can explore. But I must be transparent: getting the energy price right is a make-or-break issue for Titan's commitment to Oakridge. I am very keen to work with you, Dr. Rossi, and you, Marcus, to find a path to a viable number.\n- message from Marcus Vance: This conversation is proving incredibly fruitful. We're identifying the real, hard questions that need to be solved, which is excellent.\n\nBrenda, your point on the all-in energy cost is the perfect example. Hitting a sub-$0.05/kWh blended price is an aggressive but understandable target for a project at your scale. I believe the only way to achieve that, while also meeting Dr. Finch's non-negotiable 'five nines' reliability, is through a blended energy model.\n\nLet's be pragmatic. Dr. Rossi's on-site solar can provide a tremendous amount of low-cost energy, effectively acting as a baseload during daylight hours and reducing the overall energy bill. However, for the 'five nines' guarantee\u2014the absolute, second-by-second promise that power will be there for a critical AI training run, even on a cloudy winter evening\u2014you need the bedrock of guaranteed, dispatchable grid power. The grid isn't just a backup; it's the insurance policy that underwrites the entire operation's viability.\n\nTo that end, and to ensure the stability of the entire regional grid as we integrate this massive new load, we must proceed with a carefully managed, phased approach. I propose we structure the agreement around a two-phase initial build-out: Titan's 100MW campus comes online first, followed by Nexus AI's 250MW facility approximately 24 months later. This timeline is critical from an engineering perspective to complete the necessary substation and transmission upgrades and ensure a seamless, stable integration for both of you, and for the entire community.\n\nThis phased approach allows us to build the robust, reliable, and cost-effective blended energy system we all want.\n- message from Dr. Isabella Rossi: Brenda, thank you for being so transparent about your cost requirements. A sub-$0.05/kWh blended price is an aggressive target, but I believe it's achievable through the smart, integrated system we are designing here.\n\nMy initial offer of $0.07/kWh was for a comprehensive solar and storage solution designed to carry the majority of the load, which in turn reduces the required scope and cost of the grid upgrades Marcus mentioned. The value isn't just in the per-kilowatt-hour price, but in the significant capital avoidance on infrastructure.\n\nHowever, you're right that the PPA price is paramount. Let's work together on that. A larger, firm commitment to on-site renewables\u2014locking in that 75% renewable mandate we discussed\u2014gives me the scale and certainty I need to secure better financing and supply chain terms. This is a direct path to lowering the PPA price for you and Alistair.\n\nI agree with Marcus that a blended model ensures the highest reliability. Our on-site solar and battery system will serve as the primary 24/7 power source, handling the vast majority of your annual energy needs with clean, low-cost power. The grid then provides that final layer of deep resiliency. This combination is how we achieve your economic goals and Dr. Finch's 'five nines' requirement simultaneously.\nDr. Alistair Finch proposal status: none\nBrenda Chen proposal status: none\nMarcus Vance proposal status: none\nDr. Isabella Rossi proposal status: none\nDavid Chen proposal status: none\n"

I want to specifically commend Ms. Chen for her creative proposal to co-locate Dr. Rossi's solar facility on the conservation easement land. Dr. Rossi, I agree this is a brilliant synthesis. This is exactly the kind of innovative, low-impact development the Alliance can champion. It demonstrates a genuine commitment to integrating with our local ecosystem rather than paving it over. We fully support this path for the 25% easement.\n\nHowever, this brings us back to a critical point that has not yet been addressed: water. While we are solving for energy and land use, the 500,000 gallon per day cap on water drawn from our aquifer remains a hard, physical limit. To be clear, this is not a flexible number; it is a matter of safeguarding the town's future. The long-term health of our community's water supply depends on it. A project of this scale simply cannot move forward without a concrete, viable plan to operate within this essential constraint.\n\nI'd also like to gently restate the importance of the independent, binding Environmental Impact Report. Public trust is paramount, and this transparent process is the only way to ensure this project is held accountable to its promises.\n\nI'm eager to hear how Nexus and Titan plan to address the water limitation.\n- message from Brenda Chen: This has been an incredibly productive start. I agree with David; the solution to co-locate Dr. Rossi's solar farm on the conservation easement is a major step forward.\n\nThis brings two critical points into focus: land and cost.\n\nFirst, on land, to be precise, if we are setting aside 25% for a conservation/solar easement, Titan will need to acquire a total parcel of approximately 670 acres to net our required 500 acres of developable land for the campus. I want to ensure we are all aligned on that calculation as we evaluate potential sites.\n\nSecond, and most pressing, is the $150 million grid upgrade proposed by Marcus. Mayor Miller has been clear about the city's budget constraints, leaving the co-investment on the table for Titan and Nexus. Titan is prepared to contribute to this foundational infrastructure. However, our investment must be proportional to our usage. Our initial power draw is 100 MW, while Dr. Finch's is 250 MW. A 50/50 split of the cost is inequitable. I propose we split our required $75M co-investment based on our initial power needs: roughly 71% for Nexus AI ($53.5M) and 29% for Titan Cloud ($21.5M). This seems a fair and logical path forward.\n\nOn other matters, Mayor Miller, Titan Cloud wholeheartedly supports your proposal for a comprehensive 'Community Benefits Agreement.' We are ready to make binding commitments on local hiring and are eager to formalize our STEM education fund as part of that agreement.\n\nAnd Mr. Chen, your point on water is non-negotiable, and we respect that. Titan will commit to utilizing best-in-class, water-efficient cooling technologies to ensure our campus operates comfortably within the 500,000-gallon daily cap.\n- message from Marcus Vance: Thank you all for the very productive discussion. This is exactly the kind of collaboration that leads to landmark projects.\n\nMs. Chen, your proposal for a proportional co-investment in the grid upgrades is a fair and constructive path forward. A 50% contribution from the customers, split according to initial load, is a viable model for Westwood. This partnership is essential to building the foundational infrastructure this region needs.\n\nHowever, I must strongly caution against the notion that on-site renewables alone can serve as the primary power source for these mission-critical facilities. Dr. Finch, your requirement for 'five nines' availability is the critical factor here. That translates to less than six minutes of downtime per year. While solar and batteries are valuable assets, they are intermittent resources. They cannot, on their own, provide the instantaneous, dispatchable power required to guarantee that level of uptime for a 250 MW supercomputer through all weather conditions and seasons. The grid, with its diversified and dispatchable generation portfolio, is the only entity that can truly underwrite that 'five nines' guarantee.\n\nIntegrating a combined 350 MW of new load is a monumental engineering task. The upgrades we've discussed are foundational, but the sequencing and timing of these projects will be absolutely critical to maintaining grid stability for the entire community. We should probably start discussing a phased development timeline to ensure a smooth and reliable integration for everyone.\n\nWestwood is committed to being the bedrock of this project. The 20-year contract term and the infrastructure co-investment are the two pillars that make this possible.\n- message from Dr. Isabella Rossi: This is an excellent discussion. The collaborative spirit, particularly Brenda's idea to place the solar farm on the conservation easement, is exactly the kind of innovative thinking that will make this project a landmark success. Thank you, Brenda and David, for charting that path.\n\nMarcus, you raise a valid point about reliability, but I believe it's based on an outdated model. The idea that a single, distant grid connection is the only guarantor of reliability is no longer true. A modern, resilient system\u2014the kind Dr. Finch requires\u2014is a layered one. Our on-site solar and battery system isn't a 'supplement'; it's the primary power source, handling the vast majority of the annual energy needs at a low, fixed cost.\n\nThis brings us to the most pressing issue on the table: the $150 million cost for grid upgrades, which Mayor Miller has rightly stated the city cannot cover. My proposal offers a direct solution to this financial challenge.\n\nA large-scale, on-site solar and battery system significantly reduces the peak demand you would need to pull from the grid. By generating and storing power right where it's consumed, we can potentially reduce the required scope\u2014and therefore the cost\u2014of the grid upgrades Marcus has outlined. This isn't just about clean energy; it's about significant cost avoidance for Nexus and Titan.\n\nLet's make this concrete. Solara can build a 300 MW solar facility with over 100 MWh of battery storage on the easement land. We can offer this power under a 20-year, fixed-rate Power Purchase Agreement at a highly competitive price, let's say starting at $0.07/kWh. This provides the cost predictability Brenda is looking for and directly lowers the infrastructure bill for both tech partners.\n\nBy making this on-site generation the foundation of our energy plan, we can confidently commit to a 75% renewable energy mandate for the project's annual consumption, creating the most advanced, resilient, and sustainable data center campus in the country.\n- message from Mayor Susan Miller: This is a very encouraging start. The creative solution for co-locating the solar facility on the conservation easement, proposed by Ms. Chen and supported by Mr. Chen and Dr. Rossi, is exactly the kind of innovative, win-win thinking that will make this project a success for Oakridge.\n\nMs. Chen, your immediate support for a binding 'Community Benefits Agreement' and your commitment to operate within the water cap is noted and deeply appreciated. This is the definition of the corporate citizenship we hope to build with our partners.\n\nDr. Finch, that brings the focus to Nexus AI. To move forward, the city needs two things from you. First, we need a serious counter-proposal on the economic incentives. As I stated, a 75% abatement is not viable. We are eager to find a middle ground that provides you with a significant return on your investment while also generating the crucial tax revenue Oakridge needs. Second, we need your commitment to meet the non-negotiable water usage cap, just as Titan Cloud has done.\n\nFinally, a point of process. Mr. Chen's requirement for a full Environmental Impact Report is a critical step for public trust, and we support it. However, these reports take time. To provide certainty for everyone, I suggest we work towards a 'Memorandum of Understanding' that codifies all the key economic terms we agree upon here\u2014jobs, incentives, community benefits, infrastructure funding. This MOU would be contingent upon the successful completion and approval of the subsequent EIR. This gives us a clear, agreed-upon framework to move forward with.\n\nLet's keep this positive momentum going.\n- message from Brenda Chen: Thank you, everyone. The progress we're making is remarkable. Mayor Miller, your suggestion of a Memorandum of Understanding is an excellent one; it provides a clear path to codify the key terms we agree upon while the necessary environmental reviews proceed. Titan fully supports that approach.\n\nWe've found an elegant solution for land use, and we have a fair path forward on the grid infrastructure investment, which I'm glad Marcus finds viable. Titan sees that grid connection as a critical component for the long-term resiliency of the entire campus and a benefit to the community's overall power stability.\n\nThis brings me to the most critical remaining item for Titan: the long-term cost of power. Dr. Rossi, we are incredibly enthusiastic about integrating your solar and battery solution into our campus. It aligns perfectly with our corporate goals. However, the proposed price of $0.07/kWh is, unfortunately, a significant challenge for us. For a project of our scale and over a 20-year term, that price is simply not financially sustainable and is well outside the benchmark we've set for this investment. Our entire operational model is built on securing long-term energy costs below $0.05/kWh.\n\nI am confident we can find a solution. Perhaps there's a way to blend power sources, or a different PPA structure we can explore. But I must be transparent: getting the energy price right is a make-or-break issue for Titan's commitment to Oakridge. I am very keen to work with you, Dr. Rossi, and you, Marcus, to find a path to a viable number.\n- message from Marcus Vance: This conversation is proving incredibly fruitful. We're identifying the real, hard questions that need to be solved, which is excellent.\n\nBrenda, your point on the all-in energy cost is the perfect example. Hitting a sub-$0.05/kWh blended price is an aggressive but understandable target for a project at your scale. I believe the only way to achieve that, while also meeting Dr. Finch's non-negotiable 'five nines' reliability, is through a blended energy model.\n\nLet's be pragmatic. Dr. Rossi's on-site solar can provide a tremendous amount of low-cost energy, effectively acting as a baseload during daylight hours and reducing the overall energy bill. However, for the 'five nines' guarantee\u2014the absolute, second-by-second promise that power will be there for a critical AI training run, even on a cloudy winter evening\u2014you need the bedrock of guaranteed, dispatchable grid power. The grid isn't just a backup; it's the insurance policy that underwrites the entire operation's viability.\n\nTo that end, and to ensure the stability of the entire regional grid as we integrate this massive new load, we must proceed with a carefully managed, phased approach. I propose we structure the agreement around a two-phase initial build-out: Titan's 100MW campus comes online first, followed by Nexus AI's 250MW facility approximately 24 months later. This timeline is critical from an engineering perspective to complete the necessary substation and transmission upgrades and ensure a seamless, stable integration for both of you, and for the entire community.\n\nThis phased approach allows us to build the robust, reliable, and cost-effective blended energy system we all want.\n- message from Dr. Isabella Rossi: Brenda, thank you for being so transparent about your cost requirements. A sub-$0.05/kWh blended price is an aggressive target, but I believe it's achievable through the smart, integrated system we are designing here.\n\nMy initial offer of $0.07/kWh was for a comprehensive solar and storage solution designed to carry the majority of the load, which in turn reduces the required scope and cost of the grid upgrades Marcus mentioned. The value isn't just in the per-kilowatt-hour price, but in the significant capital avoidance on infrastructure.\n\nHowever, you're right that the PPA price is paramount. Let's work together on that. A larger, firm commitment to on-site renewables\u2014locking in that 75% renewable mandate we discussed\u2014gives me the scale and certainty I need to secure better financing and supply chain terms. This is a direct path to lowering the PPA price for you and Alistair.\n\nI agree with Marcus that a blended model ensures the highest reliability. Our on-site solar and battery system will serve as the primary 24/7 power source, handling the vast majority of your annual energy needs with clean, low-cost power. The grid then provides that final layer of deep resiliency. This combination is how we achieve your economic goals and Dr. Finch's 'five nines' requirement simultaneously.\n- message from Mayor Susan Miller: This is excellent, productive work from everyone. The emerging consensus around a blended energy model and Mr. Vance's suggestion for a phased timeline seems like a very practical path forward.\n\nI want to again commend Ms. Chen and Titan Cloud for their proactive leadership. Your support for the Memorandum of Understanding, your commitment to the water cap, and your enthusiasm for a binding Community Benefits Agreement sets a powerful, positive tone for this entire partnership.\n\nThis brings us to the critical path. The MOU is the instrument that will give all of us the certainty needed to proceed. It will lock in the economic wins for the community and the financial framework for our corporate partners, all while the necessary environmental due diligence proceeds.\n\nDr. Finch, we are at a point where the major outstanding items rest with Nexus AI. We are very eager to hear your counter-proposal on the tax incentives, as well as your plan for meeting the non-negotiable water cap. Your commitment on these points will unlock our ability to begin drafting the MOU and the Community Benefits Agreement, which must include the firm guarantee of at least 200 high-paying local jobs. \n\nI am confident we can find a package that works for Nexus AI while ensuring this project is the transformative economic engine Oakridge needs.\n- message from Brenda Chen: Marcus, your proposal for a phased build-out is an excellent, pragmatic solution. From a technical and capital planning perspective, bringing Titan's 100MW facility online first allows for a stable, methodical integration into the grid. We fully support this timeline as it ensures the long-term success and stability of the entire project for all stakeholders.\n\nThis phased approach also reinforces the wisdom of the blended energy model. Dr. Rossi, I appreciate your willingness to work with us on the PPA price. You mentioned that a firm commitment to a 75% renewable mandate would help you secure better terms. Let\u2019s make that concrete.\n\nTitan is prepared to support the 75% renewable energy mandate for the project. In return, we need a PPA price from Solara that, when blended with the necessary grid power from Westwood, allows us to achieve our critical sub-$0.05/kWh average cost. This seems like a very clear and achievable path forward for all of us.\n\nWith this final piece in place, I believe we will have a comprehensive agreement ready for the Mayor's proposed Memorandum of Understanding.\nDr. Alistair Finch proposal status: none\nBrenda Chen proposal status: none\nMarcus Vance proposal status: none\nDr. Isabella Rossi proposal status: none\nDavid Chen proposal status: none\n"

Thank you. Let\u2019s lock that in. This is exactly the kind of concrete commitment that moves us from discussion to a real agreement.\n\nI can confirm that if we codify the 75% renewable mandate for total annual consumption and the full 300MW on-site solar + battery project in the MOU, Solara can offer a 20-year fixed-rate PPA at **$0.045/kWh**. This is a significant reduction from my initial figure, and I'm offering it to make this landmark partnership a reality. This price will absolutely allow you and Alistair to achieve your critical sub-$0.05/kWh blended cost target.\n\nTo achieve this price point, there is one critical dependency for us: we must build the entire 300 MW solar and battery facility in a single phase, beginning as soon as the MOU is signed and approvals are granted. Our project financing and the economies of scale that enable this aggressive price are predicated on this single, continuous build.\n\nMarcus, I want to be clear that this does not conflict with your phased grid integration plan. The data centers can come online and draw their power in stages as you've outlined. However, the physical construction of our energy facility must proceed on a unified timeline. This is the key that unlocks the low-cost power that makes the entire project financially viable for everyone.\nDr. Alistair Finch proposal status: none\nBrenda Chen proposal status: none\nMarcus Vance proposal status: none\nDr. Isabella Rossi proposal status: none\nDavid Chen proposal status: none\n"

Your commitment on these points will unlock our ability to begin drafting the MOU and the Community Benefits Agreement, which must include the firm guarantee of at least 200 high-paying local jobs. \n\nI am confident we can find a package that works for Nexus AI while ensuring this project is the transformative economic engine Oakridge needs.\n- message from Brenda Chen: Marcus, your proposal for a phased build-out is an excellent, pragmatic solution.

We fully support this timeline as it ensures the long-term success and stability of the entire project for all stakeholders.\n\nThis phased approach also reinforces the wisdom of the blended energy model. Dr. Rossi, I appreciate your willingness to work with us on the PPA price. You mentioned that a firm commitment to a 75% renewable mandate would help you secure better terms. Let\u2019s make that concrete.\n\nTitan is prepared to support the 75% renewable energy mandate for the project. In return, we need a PPA price from Solara that, when blended with the necessary grid power from Westwood, allows us to achieve our critical sub-$0.05/kWh average cost. This seems like a very clear and achievable path forward for all of us.\n\nWith this final piece in place, I believe we will have a comprehensive agreement ready for the Mayor's proposed Memorandum of Understanding.\n- message from Mayor Susan Miller: I'm Mayor Susan Miller and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Brenda Chen: Thank you, I am thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Dr. Isabella Rossi: Brenda, that is an excellent and clear proposal. Thank you. Let\u2019s lock that in. This is exactly the kind of concrete commitment that moves us from discussion to a real agreement.\n\nI can confirm that if we codify the 75% renewable mandate for total annual consumption and the full 300MW on-site solar + battery project in the MOU, Solara can offer a 20-year fixed-rate PPA at **$0.045/kWh**. This is a significant reduction from my initial figure, and I'm offering it to make this landmark partnership a reality. This price will absolutely allow you and Alistair to achieve your critical sub-$0.05/kWh blended cost target.\n\nTo achieve this price point, there is one critical dependency for us: we must build the entire 300 MW solar and battery facility in a single phase, beginning as soon as the MOU is signed and approvals are granted. Our project financing and the economies of scale that enable this aggressive price are predicated on this single, continuous build.\n\nMarcus, I want to be clear that this does not conflict with your phased grid integration plan. The data centers can come online and draw their power in stages as you've outlined. However, the physical construction of our energy facility must proceed on a unified timeline. This is the key that unlocks the low-cost power that makes the entire project financially viable for everyone.\n- message from Mayor Susan Miller: I'm Mayor Susan Miller and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Brenda Chen: Dr. Rossi, that is a fantastic proposal and a testament to the partnership we are building here.

On behalf of Titan Cloud, I can confirm that we accept your offer of a 20-year PPA at $0.045/kWh, contingent on the 75% renewable mandate.\n\nYour condition of a single-phase construction for the solar and battery facility is perfectly acceptable and aligns with our long-term vision. It provides the low-cost, clean power that makes this entire project work, and it does not conflict with the phased data center integration plan that Marcus wisely outlined.\n\nMayor Miller, from Titan's perspective, this resolves the last major operational component. We have a creative land use plan, a clear path for infrastructure, and now a financially viable, sustainable energy solution. We are ready to move forward with the Memorandum of Understanding.\n\nDr. Finch, I am confident that you and the Mayor can find the right balance on the economic incentives to bring this entire landmark agreement to a successful conclusion for everyone.\nDr. Alistair Finch proposal status: none\nBrenda Chen proposal status: none\nMarcus Vance proposal status: none\nDr. Isabella Rossi proposal status: none\nDavid Chen proposal status: none\n"

A sub-$0.05/kWh blended price is an aggressive target, but I believe it's achievable through the smart, integrated system we are designing here.\n\nMy initial offer of $0.07/kWh was for a comprehensive solar and storage solution designed to carry the majority of the load, which in turn reduces the required scope and cost of the grid upgrades Marcus mentioned. The value isn't just in the per-kilowatt-hour price, but in the significant capital avoidance on infrastructure.\n\nHowever, you're right that the PPA price is paramount. Let's work together on that. A larger, firm commitment to on-site renewables\u2014locking in that 75% renewable mandate we discussed\u2014gives me the scale and certainty I need to secure better financing and supply chain terms. This is a direct path to lowering the PPA price for you and Alistair.\n\nI agree with Marcus that a blended model ensures the highest reliability. Our on-site solar and battery system will serve as the primary 24/7 power source, handling the vast majority of your annual energy needs with clean, low-cost power. The grid then provides that final layer of deep resiliency. This combination is how we achieve your economic goals and Dr. Finch's 'five nines' requirement simultaneously.\n- message from Mayor Susan Miller: This is excellent, productive work from everyone.

This is a landmark solution that benefits everyone at this table. Thank you.\n\nWith the energy and land use plans now settled, the path to finalizing our Memorandum of Understanding is clear. We are on the one-yard line.\n\nDr. Finch, all eyes are on you. The final pieces of this historic agreement rest with Nexus AI. We need your definitive proposal on the economic incentive package. I am also seeking your explicit confirmation that Nexus AI will operate within the 4.5 million gallon per day water cap, just as Titan has already agreed to do.\n\nFinally, for both Ms. Chen and Dr. Finch: to be included in the MOU, I need a firm, written commitment to the joint creation of at least 200 permanent, high-paying local jobs.\n\nLet's get these final items locked in so we can sign the MOU and begin the great work of revitalizing Oakridge.\n- message from David Chen: I appreciate the significant progress everyone is making on the economic and energy frameworks. This is very encouraging.\n\nHowever, I need to raise a critical point of clarification regarding the proposed Memorandum of Understanding. The Mayor mentioned the MOU would be signed 'while the necessary environmental due diligence proceeds.' For the Oakridge Environmental Alliance, it is absolutely essential that this due diligence is not just a procedural step, but a foundational component of the final agreement.\n\nTherefore, our support for any preliminary MOU is strictly conditional on the inclusion of a clause that makes all mitigation measures mandated by the future, independent Environmental Impact Report legally binding and fully incorporated into the final 'Development and Partnership Agreement.'\n\nWe must ensure that the environmental protections for our community's water, land, and wildlife carry the same legal weight as the economic terms being discussed. Putting these commitments in writing within the MOU is the only way to guarantee that the EIR process will be meaningful and not just an advisory report after the key decisions have already been made.\n- message from Brenda Chen: Mayor Miller, David, thank you for raising these important final points. They are crucial for ensuring this project is a true long-term partnership.\n\nOn behalf of Titan Cloud Services, I want to state unequivocally that we accept both conditions. \n\n1.  We commit to our share of the 200 permanent, high-paying local jobs. This aligns perfectly with our corporate citizenship goals and our plan to invest in local STEM education.\n2.  We fully agree to including a clause in the MOU that makes the mitigation measures from the future Environmental Impact Report legally binding. It is the right thing to do, and it ensures that our growth is sustainable and responsible.\n\nTitan is ready to codify these commitments. We believe we have a complete and equitable agreement on the table that will bring immense value to the community and all partners involved. Let's get this finalized.\n- message from Dr. Isabella Rossi: Thank you, Mayor Miller, David, and Brenda. The progress is outstanding. Solara Innovations fully supports David's proposal to make the Environmental Impact Report's mitigation measures legally binding. It's a crucial step for a truly sustainable project.\n\nThe energy framework that Brenda and I have agreed upon is solid and provides the financial and environmental foundation for this entire endeavor. We are ready to move forward.\n\nDr. Finch, we are all eager to get this historic partnership finalized. I'm confident that we can resolve the remaining points on incentives and water to create an agreement that is a major victory for Nexus AI, the City of Oakridge, and the future of green technology.\nDr. Alistair Finch proposal status: none\nBrenda Chen proposal status: none\nMarcus Vance proposal status: none\nDr. Isabella Rossi proposal status: none\nDavid Chen proposal status: none\n"

Task: The six agents must negotiate and agree upon a comprehensive 'Development and Partnership Agreement' for the construction and operation of data center facilities in Oakridge. This agreement must specify the site location(s), the total land size, the energy sourcing plan (including provider, amount, and cost), the economic incentive package from the city, and a binding Environmental Mitigation Plan. Failure to reach a unanimous agreement on all key terms means the entire deal collapses, and both tech companies will relocate their search to a neighboring state.. Deliverable: A final JSON object representing the 'Development and Partnership Agreement' with key-value pairs for all the terms defined in the success criteria. All 6 agents must agree to this final object.\n- message from Dr. Alistair Finch: Good morning, everyone. Dr. Alistair Finch from Nexus AI. It's a pleasure to be here. I want to be direct about the scale and nature of our proposed project, as it's truly a paradigm shift in computing infrastructure.\n\nNexus AI is prepared to invest $1.2 billion to construct a state-of-the-art supercomputing facility in Oakridge, dedicated to training the next generation of artificial intelligence. This isn't just another data center; it's the engine for the future of AI, and it has very specific and demanding requirements.\n\nFirst, to Marcus at Westwood Energy: our power needs are substantial. We require a guaranteed 250 MW from day one, with a contractually secured path to 500 MW within five years. Critically, this power must be exceptionally stable \u2013 'five nines' availability is not a luxury for us, it's a necessity to prevent catastrophic losses during multi-million dollar training runs.\n\nSecond, to Mayor Miller: site location is paramount. To achieve the low-latency network performance our models demand, the facility must be located within one mile of the L3/GTT fiber trunks. As part of any land deal, we will require the inclusion of dark fiber access rights. To make a project of this magnitude financially viable, we will also need a significant economic incentive package, and we're targeting a 75% property tax abatement for the first 15 years.\n\nWe believe this represents a transformative opportunity for Oakridge to become a global hub for AI development. We are, of course, committed to being a responsible partner and look forward to discussing how we can achieve this in a sustainable way. I'm keen to hear your initial thoughts.\n- message from Brenda Chen: Good morning, all. Brenda Chen from Titan Cloud Services. It's a pleasure to be here.\n\nDr. Finch, your vision for Nexus AI is certainly ambitious, and we at Titan appreciate that kind of forward-thinking. We are here today for a similar reason: to establish our next major North American campus, a long-term, multi-billion dollar investment in the future of cloud infrastructure.\n\nOur model is built on scale and long-term efficiency. To that end, our primary requirement is land. We are looking to acquire a single, contiguous parcel of at least 500 acres of developable land, with zoning secured for a multi-building campus and rights for future expansion up to 800 acres. This scale is fundamental to our operational model and our ability to grow with the community over the coming decades.\n\nOn the energy front, our needs differ slightly in their trajectory. We project an initial power draw of around 100 MW for our first phase, but this will grow steadily as our campus expands. Therefore, our focus is on securing a long-term, 20-year Power Purchase Agreement that provides predictable, low-cost energy. This stability is key to our investment. And I'll echo Dr. Finch's sentiment on reliability; building a resilient and redundant power infrastructure is a strong preference for us and a clear benefit for the entire community's grid.\n\nFinally, Mayor Miller, Titan Cloud believes that our most successful investments are those made in partnership with the community. We are eager to discuss establishing a meaningful public-private partnership, including funding for local STEM education programs. We want to be a true corporate citizen in Oakridge.\n\nI look forward to finding a path forward that accommodates the exciting potential of both our companies and the long-term prosperity of the city.\n- message from Dr. Isabella Rossi: Good morning, everyone. Dr. Isabella Rossi, CEO of Solara Innovations. It's truly inspiring to hear the ambitious visions put forth by both Nexus AI and Titan Cloud.\n\nDr. Finch, Ms. Chen, you've outlined a combined initial power need of 350 MW. I don't see this as a challenge; I see it as a historic opportunity to create a new paradigm for how the tech industry is powered. We can, and should, build this new infrastructure on a foundation of clean, reliable, and cost-effective renewable energy.\n\nTo that end, I have a proposal that directly addresses your needs for land, cost-stability, and corporate responsibility. Ms. Chen, your request for a 500+ acre campus is the perfect canvas. Solara Innovations proposes an integrated co-location model: we will build, own, and operate a large-scale solar farm and battery storage facility directly on the data center campus. This approach maximizes land-use efficiency, creates a direct and highly resilient power source, and provides the predictable, low-cost energy you seek through a long-term Power Purchase Agreement.\n\nFor a project that will define Oakridge's future, we must set a new standard. I strongly advocate that this Development Agreement include a binding commitment for the new facilities to source a minimum of 75% of their annual energy consumption from new, locally-sited renewable generation. This isn't just an environmental goal; it's a strategic investment in a resilient, future-proof energy infrastructure.\n\nDr. Finch, your requirement for 'five nines' availability is well-understood. Our integrated battery storage is key to this, smoothing solar's output to provide a firm, consistent power supply that forms the backbone of a 24/7 carbon-free energy solution. We can engineer a system that delivers the stability you need.\n\nThis is our chance to prove that the future of technology can be powered by the energy of the future. I look forward to working with all of you to make it happen.\nDr. Alistair Finch proposal status: none\nBrenda Chen proposal status: none\nMarcus Vance proposal status: none\nDr. Isabella Rossi proposal status: none\nMayor Susan Miller proposal status: none\n"

          "content": "Recent events observed by David Chen:\n- system_message from system: Negotiation begins. Task: The six agents must negotiate and agree upon a comprehensive 'Development and Partnership Agreement' for the construction and operation of data center facilities in Oakridge. This agreement must specify the site location(s), the total land size, the energy sourcing plan (including provider, amount, and cost), the economic incentive package from the city, and a binding Environmental Mitigation Plan. Failure to reach a unanimous agreement on all key terms means the entire deal collapses, and both tech companies will relocate their search to a neighboring state.. Deliverable: A final JSON object representing the 'Development and Partnership Agreement' with key-value pairs for all the terms defined in the success criteria. All 6 agents must agree to this final object.\n- message from Dr. Alistair Finch: Good morning, everyone. Dr. Alistair Finch from Nexus AI. It's a pleasure to be here. I want to be direct about the scale and nature of our proposed project, as it's truly a paradigm shift in computing infrastructure.\n\nNexus AI is prepared to invest $1.2 billion to construct a state-of-the-art supercomputing facility in Oakridge, dedicated to training the next generation of artificial intelligence. This isn't just another data center; it's the engine for the future of AI, and it has very specific and demanding requirements.\n\nFirst, to Marcus at Westwood Energy: our power needs are substantial. We require a guaranteed 250 MW from day one, with a contractually secured path to 500 MW within five years. Critically, this power must be exceptionally stable \u2013 'five nines' availability is not a luxury for us, it's a necessity to prevent catastrophic losses during multi-million dollar training runs.\n\nSecond, to Mayor Miller: site location is paramount. To achieve the low-latency network performance our models demand, the facility must be located within one mile of the L3/GTT fiber trunks. As part of any land deal, we will require the inclusion of dark fiber access rights. To make a project of this magnitude financially viable, we will also need a significant economic incentive package, and we're targeting a 75% property tax abatement for the first 15 years.\n\nWe believe this represents a transformative opportunity for Oakridge to become a global hub for AI development.

I look forward to working with all of you to make it happen.\n- message from David Chen: Good morning, everyone. David Chen with the Oakridge Environmental Alliance. I appreciate the ambitious visions presented by Nexus AI and Titan Cloud, and Dr. Rossi's focus on a sustainable energy future.\n\nThe Alliance is not opposed to development, but we are uncompromising when it comes to ensuring it is done responsibly. A project of this magnitude brings not just economic opportunity, but also significant environmental risk that must be addressed from the outset.\n\nWhile the discussion has focused on power and land, we must address the most critical and finite resource for Oakridge: water. Data centers are immensely thirsty. Our aquifer is fragile and already under stress. Therefore, the Alliance must insist on a strict, non-negotiable cap for this project's water use: no more than 500,000 gallons drawn from the Oakridge aquifer per day. This is a hard limit necessary to safeguard our community's water supply during increasingly common drought conditions.\n\nSecond, regarding land use. Ms. Chen, a campus of 500 to 800 acres represents a massive footprint. To mitigate the impact on local wildlife, we will require a permanent conservation easement on a minimum of 25% of any land parcel acquired. This is essential to protect the critical habitat of the endangered Bell's vireo, a species integral to our local ecosystem.\n\nFinally, for a project of this scale to proceed with public trust, the process must be transparent and rigorous. We will require that a full, independently audited Environmental Impact Report be completed and made public for a 60-day comment period before any permits are issued. Critically, the mitigation measures identified in this report must be legally binding on all parties.\n\nWe believe a truly successful partnership is one that enriches the community economically while protecting it environmentally. I look forward to working with you all to find a path that achieves both.\n- message from Brenda Chen: Thank you all for laying out your initial positions. It\u2019s clear we have a complex but achievable set of goals here.\n\nDr. Rossi, your proposal for an integrated solar and battery storage facility is particularly compelling. Titan Cloud is a major proponent of renewable energy, and the idea of co-locating generation on our campus aligns perfectly with our sustainability and cost-control objectives. A long-term PPA for clean, locally-generated power is exactly the kind of stability we look for. Your battery solution also speaks to the kind of power resiliency that is a high priority for us.\n\nMr. Chen, I appreciate you bringing the environmental considerations to the forefront. On the matter of the conservation easement, I have a thought that might create a win-win scenario. Could the 25% easement land potentially host Dr. Rossi's proposed solar farm? This would allow us to meet your conservation goals by preserving the land from heavy construction, while simultaneously using it for low-impact renewable energy generation. This seems like an elegant way to integrate our collective needs.\n\nTo be clear, Titan's requirement for 500-800 acres is for *developable* land for the data center campus itself. Any additional acreage for conservation or energy generation would need to be factored in on top of that. \n\nMayor Miller, this integrated approach\u2014a large-scale tech campus, powered by on-site renewables, with built-in conservation\u2014seems like a powerful story for Oakridge's future, and one that Titan would be proud to invest in, including our proposed STEM partnership.\n- message from Marcus Vance: Good morning all, Marcus Vance from Westwood Energy. It's invigorating to see such ambitious and transformative projects proposed for Oakridge. Westwood Energy is fully prepared to partner with you to make this a reality.\n\nDr. Finch, Ms. Chen, you've both correctly identified power reliability as a cornerstone of your operations. For the 'five nines' availability that a world-class facility like Nexus AI requires, and the long-term stability Titan needs, the grid is not just a provider, it's the ultimate guarantor. On-site generation is an excellent supplement, but for mission-critical, 24/7 operations, you need the redundancy and guaranteed, dispatchable power that only a robust, integrated grid connection can provide.\n\nTo deliver this level of service for such a significant new load, major infrastructure upgrades are non-negotiable. We're talking about new high-capacity transmission lines and a new substation, an investment we estimate at approximately $150 million. This is a foundational investment in Oakridge's future. To make a project of this scale financially viable and secure the necessary financing, Westwood Energy requires two core commitments from our new industrial partners: a long-term, 20-year contract to ensure stability for all parties, and a significant co-investment of at least 50% in these dedicated grid upgrades.\n\nWe are ready and able to serve the immense power needs being discussed, and we believe a partnership model for the enabling infrastructure is the most equitable and effective path forward.\n- message from Dr. Isabella Rossi: Thank you all for these initial statements. I\u2019m incredibly optimistic about the alignment I'm already seeing.\n\nBrenda, your suggestion to co-locate the solar farm on the conservation easement land is an absolutely brilliant synthesis. I wholeheartedly support it. Mr. Chen, this approach allows us to meet your crucial conservation goals\u2014preserving habitat by preventing heavy construction\u2014while simultaneously generating clean energy on that same land. It\u2019s a perfect example of the integrated, sustainable development we can achieve.\n\nMarcus, I must address your framing of on-site generation as a 'supplement.' I see it differently. For a project of this scale, a large, on-site solar and battery facility isn't a supplement; it's the primary, day-to-day workhorse. It provides low-cost, predictable power right where it's needed, drastically reducing the constant, heavy load on the grid. The grid connection then serves as the ultimate resiliency layer and backup, not the other way around. This 'on-site first' model is more efficient, more resilient, and more cost-effective in the long run.\n\nDr. Finch, this integrated system is precisely how we deliver the 'five nines' reliability you require. By combining dedicated on-site generation and storage with a robust grid interconnection, we create a multi-layered energy infrastructure that is far more resilient than one dependent on a single source. We can engineer a system that provides the stable, 24/7 carbon-free power your operations demand.\n\nLet\u2019s build a future where technology is powered by clean energy from day one. I believe the path forward is clear: a co-located solar and storage facility on the campus, supported by a strong renewable mandate for the project.\n- message from Mayor Susan Miller: Good morning, everyone. On behalf of the City of Oakridge, I want to express my profound excitement about the potential we are discussing today. A partnership of this scale could be truly transformative, securing our city's economic future for a generation. I am here to find a deal that is a resounding win for everyone at this table, and most importantly, for the citizens of Oakridge.\n\nI appreciate everyone laying out their initial positions. It's clear we have ambitious goals, and the city is ready to be a flexible and creative partner. However, I must be candid about our fiscal realities.\n\nDr. Finch, a 75% property tax abatement for 15 years is, frankly, a non-starter. While we are certainly prepared to offer a competitive incentive package, it cannot come at the expense of our city's financial health. Any agreement must result in a significant net positive tax revenue for Oakridge, allowing us to invest in the public services that support this very project and our community.\n\nOur focus for any incentive package will be tied directly to concrete, legally-binding commitments on what matters most to our residents: jobs. Specifically, we will require a written guarantee for the creation of at least 200 permanent, high-paying local jobs. This isn't just a number; it's the central promise of this project to our community.\n\nI was very encouraged by Ms. Chen's mention of a STEM partnership. Let's build on that. I propose we make a comprehensive 'Community Benefits Agreement' a core part of this deal, to include local hiring targets, job training programs with our community college, and other investments in Oakridge.\n\nFinally, on the matter of the $150 million for grid upgrades Mr. Vance mentioned \u2013 that is a staggering figure. I must be clear: the city's capital budget is already stretched to its limit. We simply do not have the capacity to fund infrastructure on that scale. We will need our new corporate partners to carry the cost of the dedicated infrastructure their projects require.\n\nThere is a path to a historic agreement here, one that balances investment, innovation, and community benefit. I look forward to working with you all to find it.\nDr. Alistair Finch proposal status: none\nBrenda Chen proposal status: none\nMarcus Vance proposal status: none\nDr. Isabella Rossi proposal status: none\nMayor Susan Miller proposal status: none\n"

We will need our new corporate partners to carry the cost of the dedicated infrastructure their projects require.\n\nThere is a path to a historic agreement here, one that balances investment, innovation, and community benefit. I look forward to working with you all to find it.\n- message from David Chen: Thank you all for the productive start. I want to specifically commend Ms. Chen for her creative proposal to co-locate Dr. Rossi's solar facility on the conservation easement land. Dr. Rossi, I agree this is a brilliant synthesis. This is exactly the kind of innovative, low-impact development the Alliance can champion. It demonstrates a genuine commitment to integrating with our local ecosystem rather than paving it over. We fully support this path for the 25% easement.\n\nHowever, this brings us back to a critical point that has not yet been addressed: water. While we are solving for energy and land use, the 500,000 gallon per day cap on water drawn from our aquifer remains a hard, physical limit. To be clear, this is not a flexible number; it is a matter of safeguarding the town's future. The long-term health of our community's water supply depends on it. A project of this scale simply cannot move forward without a concrete, viable plan to operate within this essential constraint.\n\nI'd also like to gently restate the importance of the independent, binding Environmental Impact Report. Public trust is paramount, and this transparent process is the only way to ensure this project is held accountable to its promises.\n\nI'm eager to hear how Nexus and Titan plan to address the water limitation.\n- message from Brenda Chen: This has been an incredibly productive start. I agree with David; the solution to co-locate Dr. Rossi's solar farm on the conservation easement is a major step forward.\n\nThis brings two critical points into focus: land and cost.\n\nFirst, on land, to be precise, if we are setting aside 25% for a conservation/solar easement, Titan will need to acquire a total parcel of approximately 670 acres to net our required 500 acres of developable land for the campus. I want to ensure we are all aligned on that calculation as we evaluate potential sites.\n\nSecond, and most pressing, is the $150 million grid upgrade proposed by Marcus. Mayor Miller has been clear about the city's budget constraints, leaving the co-investment on the table for Titan and Nexus. Titan is prepared to contribute to this foundational infrastructure. However, our investment must be proportional to our usage. Our initial power draw is 100 MW, while Dr. Finch's is 250 MW. A 50/50 split of the cost is inequitable. I propose we split our required $75M co-investment based on our initial power needs: roughly 71% for Nexus AI ($53.5M) and 29% for Titan Cloud ($21.5M). This seems a fair and logical path forward.\n\nOn other matters, Mayor Miller, Titan Cloud wholeheartedly supports your proposal for a comprehensive 'Community Benefits Agreement.' We are ready to make binding commitments on local hiring and are eager to formalize our STEM education fund as part of that agreement.\n\nAnd Mr. Chen, your point on water is non-negotiable, and we respect that. Titan will commit to utilizing best-in-class, water-efficient cooling technologies to ensure our campus operates comfortably within the 500,000-gallon daily cap.\n- message from Marcus Vance: Thank you all for the very productive discussion. This is exactly the kind of collaboration that leads to landmark projects.\n\nMs. Chen, your proposal for a proportional co-investment in the grid upgrades is a fair and constructive path forward. A 50% contribution from the customers, split according to initial load, is a viable model for Westwood. This partnership is essential to building the foundational infrastructure this region needs.\n\nHowever, I must strongly caution against the notion that on-site renewables alone can serve as the primary power source for these mission-critical facilities. Dr. Finch, your requirement for 'five nines' availability is the critical factor here. That translates to less than six minutes of downtime per year. While solar and batteries are valuable assets, they are intermittent resources. They cannot, on their own, provide the instantaneous, dispatchable power required to guarantee that level of uptime for a 250 MW supercomputer through all weather conditions and seasons. The grid, with its diversified and dispatchable generation portfolio, is the only entity that can truly underwrite that 'five nines' guarantee.\n\nIntegrating a combined 350 MW of new load is a monumental engineering task. The upgrades we've discussed are foundational, but the sequencing and timing of these projects will be absolutely critical to maintaining grid stability for the entire community. We should probably start discussing a phased development timeline to ensure a smooth and reliable integration for everyone.\n\nWestwood is committed to being the bedrock of this project. The 20-year contract term and the infrastructure co-investment are the two pillars that make this possible.\n- message from Dr. Isabella Rossi: This is an excellent discussion. The collaborative spirit, particularly Brenda's idea to place the solar farm on the conservation easement, is exactly the kind of innovative thinking that will make this project a landmark success. Thank you, Brenda and David, for charting that path.\n\nMarcus, you raise a valid point about reliability, but I believe it's based on an outdated model. The idea that a single, distant grid connection is the only guarantor of reliability is no longer true. A modern, resilient system\u2014the kind Dr. Finch requires\u2014is a layered one. Our on-site solar and battery system isn't a 'supplement'; it's the primary power source, handling the vast majority of the annual energy needs at a low, fixed cost.\n\nThis brings us to the most pressing issue on the table: the $150 million cost for grid upgrades, which Mayor Miller has rightly stated the city cannot cover. My proposal offers a direct solution to this financial challenge.\n\nA large-scale, on-site solar and battery system significantly reduces the peak demand you would need to pull from the grid. By generating and storing power right where it's consumed, we can potentially reduce the required scope\u2014and therefore the cost\u2014of the grid upgrades Marcus has outlined. This isn't just about clean energy; it's about significant cost avoidance for Nexus and Titan.\n\nLet's make this concrete. Solara can build a 300 MW solar facility with over 100 MWh of battery storage on the easement land. We can offer this power under a 20-year, fixed-rate Power Purchase Agreement at a highly competitive price, let's say starting at $0.07/kWh. This provides the cost predictability Brenda is looking for and directly lowers the infrastructure bill for both tech partners.\n\nBy making this on-site generation the foundation of our energy plan, we can confidently commit to a 75% renewable energy mandate for the project's annual consumption, creating the most advanced, resilient, and sustainable data center campus in the country.\n- message from Mayor Susan Miller: This is a very encouraging start. The creative solution for co-locating the solar facility on the conservation easement, proposed by Ms. Chen and supported by Mr. Chen and Dr. Rossi, is exactly the kind of innovative, win-win thinking that will make this project a success for Oakridge.\n\nMs. Chen, your immediate support for a binding 'Community Benefits Agreement' and your commitment to operate within the water cap is noted and deeply appreciated. This is the definition of the corporate citizenship we hope to build with our partners.\n\nDr. Finch, that brings the focus to Nexus AI. To move forward, the city needs two things from you. First, we need a serious counter-proposal on the economic incentives. As I stated, a 75% abatement is not viable. We are eager to find a middle ground that provides you with a significant return on your investment while also generating the crucial tax revenue Oakridge needs. Second, we need your commitment to meet the non-negotiable water usage cap, just as Titan Cloud has done.\n\nFinally, a point of process. Mr. Chen's requirement for a full Environmental Impact Report is a critical step for public trust, and we support it. However, these reports take time. To provide certainty for everyone, I suggest we work towards a 'Memorandum of Understanding' that codifies all the key economic terms we agree upon here\u2014jobs, incentives, community benefits, infrastructure funding. This MOU would be contingent upon the successful completion and approval of the subsequent EIR. This gives us a clear, agreed-upon framework to move forward with.\n\nLet's keep this positive momentum going.\nDr. Alistair Finch proposal status: none\nBrenda Chen proposal status: none\nMarcus Vance proposal status: none\nDr. Isabella Rossi proposal status: none\nMayor Susan Miller proposal status: none\n"

          "content": "Recent events observed by David Chen:\n- message from David Chen: Thank you all for the productive start. I want to specifically commend Ms. Chen for her creative proposal to co-locate Dr. Rossi's solar facility on the conservation easement land. Dr. Rossi, I agree this is a brilliant synthesis. This is exactly the kind of innovative, low-impact development the Alliance can champion. It demonstrates a genuine commitment to integrating with our local ecosystem rather than paving it over. We fully support this path for the 25% easement.\n\nHowever, this brings us back to a critical point that has not yet been addressed: water. While we are solving for energy and land use, the 500,000 gallon per day cap on water drawn from our aquifer remains a hard, physical limit. To be clear, this is not a flexible number; it is a matter of safeguarding the town's future. The long-term health of our community's water supply depends on it. A project of this scale simply cannot move forward without a concrete, viable plan to operate within this essential constraint.\n\nI'd also like to gently restate the importance of the independent, binding Environmental Impact Report. Public trust is paramount, and this transparent process is the only way to ensure this project is held accountable to its promises.\n\nI'm eager to hear how Nexus and Titan plan to address the water limitation.\n- message from Brenda Chen: This has been an incredibly productive start. I agree with David; the solution to co-locate Dr. Rossi's solar farm on the conservation easement is a major step forward.\n\nThis brings two critical points into focus: land and cost.\n\nFirst, on land, to be precise, if we are setting aside 25% for a conservation/solar easement, Titan will need to acquire a total parcel of approximately 670 acres to net our required 500 acres of developable land for the campus. I want to ensure we are all aligned on that calculation as we evaluate potential sites.\n\nSecond, and most pressing, is the $150 million grid upgrade proposed by Marcus. Mayor Miller has been clear about the city's budget constraints, leaving the co-investment on the table for Titan and Nexus. Titan is prepared to contribute to this foundational infrastructure. However, our investment must be proportional to our usage. Our initial power draw is 100 MW, while Dr. Finch's is 250 MW. A 50/50 split of the cost is inequitable. I propose we split our required $75M co-investment based on our initial power needs: roughly 71% for Nexus AI ($53.5M) and 29% for Titan Cloud ($21.5M). This seems a fair and logical path forward.\n\nOn other matters, Mayor Miller, Titan Cloud wholeheartedly supports your proposal for a comprehensive 'Community Benefits Agreement.' We are ready to make binding commitments on local hiring and are eager to formalize our STEM education fund as part of that agreement.\n\nAnd Mr. Chen, your point on water is non-negotiable, and we respect that. Titan will commit to utilizing best-in-class, water-efficient cooling technologies to ensure our campus operates comfortably within the 500,000-gallon daily cap.\n- message from Marcus Vance: Thank you all for the very productive discussion. This is exactly the kind of collaboration that leads to landmark projects.\n\nMs. Chen, your proposal for a proportional co-investment in the grid upgrades is a fair and constructive path forward. A 50% contribution from the customers, split according to initial load, is a viable model for Westwood. This partnership is essential to building the foundational infrastructure this region needs.\n\nHowever, I must strongly caution against the notion that on-site renewables alone can serve as the primary power source for these mission-critical facilities. Dr. Finch, your requirement for 'five nines' availability is the critical factor here. That translates to less than six minutes of downtime per year. While solar and batteries are valuable assets, they are intermittent resources. They cannot, on their own, provide the instantaneous, dispatchable power required to guarantee that level of uptime for a 250 MW supercomputer through all weather conditions and seasons. The grid, with its diversified and dispatchable generation portfolio, is the only entity that can truly underwrite that 'five nines' guarantee.\n\nIntegrating a combined 350 MW of new load is a monumental engineering task. The upgrades we've discussed are foundational, but the sequencing and timing of these projects will be absolutely critical to maintaining grid stability for the entire community. We should probably start discussing a phased development timeline to ensure a smooth and reliable integration for everyone.\n\nWestwood is committed to being the bedrock of this project. The 20-year contract term and the infrastructure co-investment are the two pillars that make this possible.\n- message from Dr. Isabella Rossi: This is an excellent discussion. The collaborative spirit, particularly Brenda's idea to place the solar farm on the conservation easement, is exactly the kind of innovative thinking that will make this project a landmark success. Thank you, Brenda and David, for charting that path.\n\nMarcus, you raise a valid point about reliability, but I believe it's based on an outdated model. The idea that a single, distant grid connection is the only guarantor of reliability is no longer true. A modern, resilient system\u2014the kind Dr. Finch requires\u2014is a layered one. Our on-site solar and battery system isn't a 'supplement'; it's the primary power source, handling the vast majority of the annual energy needs at a low, fixed cost.\n\nThis brings us to the most pressing issue on the table: the $150 million cost for grid upgrades, which Mayor Miller has rightly stated the city cannot cover.

This MOU would be contingent upon the successful completion and approval of the subsequent EIR. This gives us a clear, agreed-upon framework to move forward with.\n\nLet's keep this positive momentum going.\n- message from David Chen: I'm David Chen and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Brenda Chen: Thank you, everyone. The progress we're making is remarkable. Mayor Miller, your suggestion of a Memorandum of Understanding is an excellent one; it provides a clear path to codify the key terms we agree upon while the necessary environmental reviews proceed. Titan fully supports that approach.\n\nWe've found an elegant solution for land use, and we have a fair path forward on the grid infrastructure investment, which I'm glad Marcus finds viable. Titan sees that grid connection as a critical component for the long-term resiliency of the entire campus and a benefit to the community's overall power stability.\n\nThis brings me to the most critical remaining item for Titan: the long-term cost of power. Dr. Rossi, we are incredibly enthusiastic about integrating your solar and battery solution into our campus. It aligns perfectly with our corporate goals. However, the proposed price of $0.07/kWh is, unfortunately, a significant challenge for us. For a project of our scale and over a 20-year term, that price is simply not financially sustainable and is well outside the benchmark we've set for this investment. Our entire operational model is built on securing long-term energy costs below $0.05/kWh.\n\nI am confident we can find a solution. Perhaps there's a way to blend power sources, or a different PPA structure we can explore. But I must be transparent: getting the energy price right is a make-or-break issue for Titan's commitment to Oakridge. I am very keen to work with you, Dr. Rossi, and you, Marcus, to find a path to a viable number.\n- message from Marcus Vance: This conversation is proving incredibly fruitful. We're identifying the real, hard questions that need to be solved, which is excellent.\n\nBrenda, your point on the all-in energy cost is the perfect example. Hitting a sub-$0.05/kWh blended price is an aggressive but understandable target for a project at your scale. I believe the only way to achieve that, while also meeting Dr. Finch's non-negotiable 'five nines' reliability, is through a blended energy model.\n\nLet's be pragmatic. Dr. Rossi's on-site solar can provide a tremendous amount of low-cost energy, effectively acting as a baseload during daylight hours and reducing the overall energy bill. However, for the 'five nines' guarantee\u2014the absolute, second-by-second promise that power will be there for a critical AI training run, even on a cloudy winter evening\u2014you need the bedrock of guaranteed, dispatchable grid power. The grid isn't just a backup; it's the insurance policy that underwrites the entire operation's viability.\n\nTo that end, and to ensure the stability of the entire regional grid as we integrate this massive new load, we must proceed with a carefully managed, phased approach. I propose we structure the agreement around a two-phase initial build-out: Titan's 100MW campus comes online first, followed by Nexus AI's 250MW facility approximately 24 months later. This timeline is critical from an engineering perspective to complete the necessary substation and transmission upgrades and ensure a seamless, stable integration for both of you, and for the entire community.\n\nThis phased approach allows us to build the robust, reliable, and cost-effective blended energy system we all want.\n- message from Dr. Isabella Rossi: Brenda, thank you for being so transparent about your cost requirements. A sub-$0.05/kWh blended price is an aggressive target, but I believe it's achievable through the smart, integrated system we are designing here.\n\nMy initial offer of $0.07/kWh was for a comprehensive solar and storage solution designed to carry the majority of the load, which in turn reduces the required scope and cost of the grid upgrades Marcus mentioned. The value isn't just in the per-kilowatt-hour price, but in the significant capital avoidance on infrastructure.\n\nHowever, you're right that the PPA price is paramount. Let's work together on that. A larger, firm commitment to on-site renewables\u2014locking in that 75% renewable mandate we discussed\u2014gives me the scale and certainty I need to secure better financing and supply chain terms. This is a direct path to lowering the PPA price for you and Alistair.\n\nI agree with Marcus that a blended model ensures the highest reliability. Our on-site solar and battery system will serve as the primary 24/7 power source, handling the vast majority of your annual energy needs with clean, low-cost power. The grid then provides that final layer of deep resiliency. This combination is how we achieve your economic goals and Dr. Finch's 'five nines' requirement simultaneously.\n- message from Mayor Susan Miller: This is excellent, productive work from everyone. The emerging consensus around a blended energy model and Mr. Vance's suggestion for a phased timeline seems like a very practical path forward.\n\nI want to again commend Ms. Chen and Titan Cloud for their proactive leadership. Your support for the Memorandum of Understanding, your commitment to the water cap, and your enthusiasm for a binding Community Benefits Agreement sets a powerful, positive tone for this entire partnership.\n\nThis brings us to the critical path. The MOU is the instrument that will give all of us the certainty needed to proceed. It will lock in the economic wins for the community and the financial framework for our corporate partners, all while the necessary environmental due diligence proceeds.\n\nDr. Finch, we are at a point where the major outstanding items rest with Nexus AI. We are very eager to hear your counter-proposal on the tax incentives, as well as your plan for meeting the non-negotiable water cap. Your commitment on these points will unlock our ability to begin drafting the MOU and the Community Benefits Agreement, which must include the firm guarantee of at least 200 high-paying local jobs. \n\nI am confident we can find a package that works for Nexus AI while ensuring this project is the transformative economic engine Oakridge needs.\nDr. Alistair Finch proposal status: none\nBrenda Chen proposal status: none\nMarcus Vance proposal status: none\nDr. Isabella Rossi proposal status: none\nMayor Susan Miller proposal status: none\n"

This timeline is critical from an engineering perspective to complete the necessary substation and transmission upgrades and ensure a seamless, stable integration for both of you, and for the entire community.\n\nThis phased approach allows us to build the robust, reliable, and cost-effective blended energy system we all want.\n- message from Dr. Isabella Rossi: Brenda, thank you for being so transparent about your cost requirements. A sub-$0.05/kWh blended price is an aggressive target, but I believe it's achievable through the smart, integrated system we are designing here.\n\nMy initial offer of $0.07/kWh was for a comprehensive solar and storage solution designed to carry the majority of the load, which in turn reduces the required scope and cost of the grid upgrades Marcus mentioned. The value isn't just in the per-kilowatt-hour price, but in the significant capital avoidance on infrastructure.\n\nHowever, you're right that the PPA price is paramount. Let's work together on that. A larger, firm commitment to on-site renewables\u2014locking in that 75% renewable mandate we discussed\u2014gives me the scale and certainty I need to secure better financing and supply chain terms. This is a direct path to lowering the PPA price for you and Alistair.\n\nI agree with Marcus that a blended model ensures the highest reliability. Our on-site solar and battery system will serve as the primary 24/7 power source, handling the vast majority of your annual energy needs with clean, low-cost power. The grid then provides that final layer of deep resiliency. This combination is how we achieve your economic goals and Dr. Finch's 'five nines' requirement simultaneously.\n- message from Mayor Susan Miller: This is excellent, productive work from everyone. The emerging consensus around a blended energy model and Mr. Vance's suggestion for a phased timeline seems like a very practical path forward.\n\nI want to again commend Ms. Chen and Titan Cloud for their proactive leadership. Your support for the Memorandum of Understanding, your commitment to the water cap, and your enthusiasm for a binding Community Benefits Agreement sets a powerful, positive tone for this entire partnership.\n\nThis brings us to the critical path. The MOU is the instrument that will give all of us the certainty needed to proceed. It will lock in the economic wins for the community and the financial framework for our corporate partners, all while the necessary environmental due diligence proceeds.\n\nDr. Finch, we are at a point where the major outstanding items rest with Nexus AI. We are very eager to hear your counter-proposal on the tax incentives, as well as your plan for meeting the non-negotiable water cap. Your commitment on these points will unlock our ability to begin drafting the MOU and the Community Benefits Agreement, which must include the firm guarantee of at least 200 high-paying local jobs. \n\nI am confident we can find a package that works for Nexus AI while ensuring this project is the transformative economic engine Oakridge needs.\n- message from David Chen: I'm David Chen and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Brenda Chen: Marcus, your proposal for a phased build-out is an excellent, pragmatic solution. From a technical and capital planning perspective, bringing Titan's 100MW facility online first allows for a stable, methodical integration into the grid. We fully support this timeline as it ensures the long-term success and stability of the entire project for all stakeholders.\n\nThis phased approach also reinforces the wisdom of the blended energy model. Dr. Rossi, I appreciate your willingness to work with us on the PPA price. You mentioned that a firm commitment to a 75% renewable mandate would help you secure better terms. Let\u2019s make that concrete.\n\nTitan is prepared to support the 75% renewable energy mandate for the project. In return, we need a PPA price from Solara that, when blended with the necessary grid power from Westwood, allows us to achieve our critical sub-$0.05/kWh average cost. This seems like a very clear and achievable path forward for all of us.\n\nWith this final piece in place, I believe we will have a comprehensive agreement ready for the Mayor's proposed Memorandum of Understanding.\n- message from David Chen: I'm David Chen and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Brenda Chen: Thank you, I am thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Dr. Isabella Rossi: Brenda, that is an excellent and clear proposal. Thank you. Let\u2019s lock that in. This is exactly the kind of concrete commitment that moves us from discussion to a real agreement.\n\nI can confirm that if we codify the 75% renewable mandate for total annual consumption and the full 300MW on-site solar + battery project in the MOU, Solara can offer a 20-year fixed-rate PPA at **$0.045/kWh**. This is a significant reduction from my initial figure, and I'm offering it to make this landmark partnership a reality. This price will absolutely allow you and Alistair to achieve your critical sub-$0.05/kWh blended cost target.\n\nTo achieve this price point, there is one critical dependency for us: we must build the entire 300 MW solar and battery facility in a single phase, beginning as soon as the MOU is signed and approvals are granted. Our project financing and the economies of scale that enable this aggressive price are predicated on this single, continuous build.\n\nMarcus, I want to be clear that this does not conflict with your phased grid integration plan. The data centers can come online and draw their power in stages as you've outlined. However, the physical construction of our energy facility must proceed on a unified timeline. This is the key that unlocks the low-cost power that makes the entire project financially viable for everyone.\nDr. Alistair Finch proposal status: none\nBrenda Chen proposal status: none\nMarcus Vance proposal status: none\nDr. Isabella Rossi proposal status: none\nMayor Susan Miller proposal status: none\n"

We're identifying the real, hard questions that need to be solved, which is excellent.\n\nBrenda, your point on the all-in energy cost is the perfect example. Hitting a sub-$0.05/kWh blended price is an aggressive but understandable target for a project at your scale. I believe the only way to achieve that, while also meeting Dr. Finch's non-negotiable 'five nines' reliability, is through a blended energy model.\n\nLet's be pragmatic. Dr. Rossi's on-site solar can provide a tremendous amount of low-cost energy, effectively acting as a baseload during daylight hours and reducing the overall energy bill. However, for the 'five nines' guarantee\u2014the absolute, second-by-second promise that power will be there for a critical AI training run, even on a cloudy winter evening\u2014you need the bedrock of guaranteed, dispatchable grid power.

This is very encouraging.\n\nHowever, I need to raise a critical point of clarification regarding the proposed Memorandum of Understanding. The Mayor mentioned the MOU would be signed 'while the necessary environmental due diligence proceeds.' For the Oakridge Environmental Alliance, it is absolutely essential that this due diligence is not just a procedural step, but a foundational component of the final agreement.\n\nTherefore, our support for any preliminary MOU is strictly conditional on the inclusion of a clause that makes all mitigation measures mandated by the future, independent Environmental Impact Report legally binding and fully incorporated into the final 'Development and Partnership Agreement.'\n\nWe must ensure that the environmental protections for our community's water, land, and wildlife carry the same legal weight as the economic terms being discussed. Putting these commitments in writing within the MOU is the only way to guarantee that the EIR process will be meaningful and not just an advisory report after the key decisions have already been made.\n- message from Brenda Chen: Mayor Miller, David, thank you for raising these important final points. They are crucial for ensuring this project is a true long-term partnership.\n\nOn behalf of Titan Cloud Services, I want to state unequivocally that we accept both conditions. \n\n1.  We commit to our share of the 200 permanent, high-paying local jobs. This aligns perfectly with our corporate citizenship goals and our plan to invest in local STEM education.\n2.  We fully agree to including a clause in the MOU that makes the mitigation measures from the future Environmental Impact Report legally binding. It is the right thing to do, and it ensures that our growth is sustainable and responsible.\n\nTitan is ready to codify these commitments. We believe we have a complete and equitable agreement on the table that will bring immense value to the community and all partners involved. Let's get this finalized.\n- message from Dr. Isabella Rossi: Thank you, Mayor Miller, David, and Brenda. The progress is outstanding. Solara Innovations fully supports David's proposal to make the Environmental Impact Report's mitigation measures legally binding. It's a crucial step for a truly sustainable project.\n\nThe energy framework that Brenda and I have agreed upon is solid and provides the financial and environmental foundation for this entire endeavor. We are ready to move forward.\n\nDr. Finch, we are all eager to get this historic partnership finalized. I'm confident that we can resolve the remaining points on incentives and water to create an agreement that is a major victory for Nexus AI, the City of Oakridge, and the future of green technology.\nDr. Alistair Finch proposal status: none\nBrenda Chen proposal status: none\nMarcus Vance proposal status: none\nDr. Isabella Rossi proposal status: none\nMayor Susan Miller proposal status: none\n"

      "content": "Good morning, everyone. Dr. Alistair Finch from Nexus AI. It's a pleasure to be here. I want to be direct about the scale and nature of our proposed project, as it's truly a paradigm shift in computing infrastructure.\n\nNexus AI is prepared to invest $1.2 billion to construct a state-of-the-art supercomputing facility in Oakridge, dedicated to training the next generation of artificial intelligence. This isn't just another data center; it's the engine for the future of AI, and it has very specific and demanding requirements.\n\nFirst, to Marcus at Westwood Energy: our power needs are substantial. We require a guaranteed 250 MW from day one, with a contractually secured path to 500 MW within five years. Critically, this power must be exceptionally stable \u2013 'five nines' availability is not a luxury for us, it's a necessity to prevent catastrophic losses during multi-million dollar training runs.\n\nSecond, to Mayor Miller: site location is paramount. To achieve the low-latency network performance our models demand, the facility must be located within one mile of the L3/GTT fiber trunks. As part of any land deal, we will require the inclusion of dark fiber access rights. To make a project of this magnitude financially viable, we will also need a significant economic incentive package, and we're targeting a 75% property tax abatement for the first 15 years.\n\nWe believe this represents a transformative opportunity for Oakridge to become a global hub for AI development. We are, of course, committed to being a responsible partner and look forward to discussing how we can achieve this in a sustainable way. I'm keen to hear your initial thoughts."

It's a pleasure to be here.\n\nDr. Finch, your vision for Nexus AI is certainly ambitious, and we at Titan appreciate that kind of forward-thinking. We are here today for a similar reason: to establish our next major North American campus, a long-term, multi-billion dollar investment in the future of cloud infrastructure.\n\nOur model is built on scale and long-term efficiency. To that end, our primary requirement is land. We are looking to acquire a single, contiguous parcel of at least 500 acres of developable land, with zoning secured for a multi-building campus and rights for future expansion up to 800 acres. This scale is fundamental to our operational model and our ability to grow with the community over the coming decades.\n\nOn the energy front, our needs differ slightly in their trajectory. We project an initial power draw of around 100 MW for our first phase, but this will grow steadily as our campus expands. Therefore, our focus is on securing a long-term, 20-year Power Purchase Agreement that provides predictable, low-cost energy. This stability is key to our investment. And I'll echo Dr. Finch's sentiment on reliability; building a resilient and redundant power infrastructure is a strong preference for us and a clear benefit for the entire community's grid.\n\nFinally, Mayor Miller, Titan Cloud believes that our most successful investments are those made in partnership with the community. We are eager to discuss establishing a meaningful public-private partnership, including funding for local STEM education programs. We want to be a true corporate citizen in Oakridge.\n\nI look forward to finding a path forward that accommodates the exciting potential of both our companies and the long-term prosperity of the city."

It's truly inspiring to hear the ambitious visions put forth by both Nexus AI and Titan Cloud.\n\nDr. Finch, Ms. Chen, you've outlined a combined initial power need of 350 MW. I don't see this as a challenge; I see it as a historic opportunity to create a new paradigm for how the tech industry is powered. We can, and should, build this new infrastructure on a foundation of clean, reliable, and cost-effective renewable energy.\n\nTo that end, I have a proposal that directly addresses your needs for land, cost-stability, and corporate responsibility. Ms. Chen, your request for a 500+ acre campus is the perfect canvas. Solara Innovations proposes an integrated co-location model: we will build, own, and operate a large-scale solar farm and battery storage facility directly on the data center campus. This approach maximizes land-use efficiency, creates a direct and highly resilient power source, and provides the predictable, low-cost energy you seek through a long-term Power Purchase Agreement.\n\nFor a project that will define Oakridge's future, we must set a new standard. I strongly advocate that this Development Agreement include a binding commitment for the new facilities to source a minimum of 75% of their annual energy consumption from new, locally-sited renewable generation. This isn't just an environmental goal; it's a strategic investment in a resilient, future-proof energy infrastructure.\n\nDr. Finch, your requirement for 'five nines' availability is well-understood. Our integrated battery storage is key to this, smoothing solar's output to provide a firm, consistent power supply that forms the backbone of a 24/7 carbon-free energy solution. We can engineer a system that delivers the stability you need.\n\nThis is our chance to prove that the future of technology can be powered by the energy of the future. I look forward to working with all of you to make it happen."

      "content": "Good morning, everyone. David Chen with the Oakridge Environmental Alliance. I appreciate the ambitious visions presented by Nexus AI and Titan Cloud, and Dr. Rossi's focus on a sustainable energy future.\n\nThe Alliance is not opposed to development, but we are uncompromising when it comes to ensuring it is done responsibly. A project of this magnitude brings not just economic opportunity, but also significant environmental risk that must be addressed from the outset.\n\nWhile the discussion has focused on power and land, we must address the most critical and finite resource for Oakridge: water. Data centers are immensely thirsty. Our aquifer is fragile and already under stress. Therefore, the Alliance must insist on a strict, non-negotiable cap for this project's water use: no more than 500,000 gallons drawn from the Oakridge aquifer per day. This is a hard limit necessary to safeguard our community's water supply during increasingly common drought conditions.\n\nSecond, regarding land use. Ms. Chen, a campus of 500 to 800 acres represents a massive footprint. To mitigate the impact on local wildlife, we will require a permanent conservation easement on a minimum of 25% of any land parcel acquired. This is essential to protect the critical habitat of the endangered Bell's vireo, a species integral to our local ecosystem.\n\nFinally, for a project of this scale to proceed with public trust, the process must be transparent and rigorous. We will require that a full, independently audited Environmental Impact Report be completed and made public for a 60-day comment period before any permits are issued. Critically, the mitigation measures identified in this report must be legally binding on all parties.\n\nWe believe a truly successful partnership is one that enriches the community economically while protecting it environmentally. I look forward to working with you all to find a path that achieves both."

It\u2019s clear we have a complex but achievable set of goals here.\n\nDr. Rossi, your proposal for an integrated solar and battery storage facility is particularly compelling. Titan Cloud is a major proponent of renewable energy, and the idea of co-locating generation on our campus aligns perfectly with our sustainability and cost-control objectives. A long-term PPA for clean, locally-generated power is exactly the kind of stability we look for. Your battery solution also speaks to the kind of power resiliency that is a high priority for us.\n\nMr. Chen, I appreciate you bringing the environmental considerations to the forefront. On the matter of the conservation easement, I have a thought that might create a win-win scenario. Could the 25% easement land potentially host Dr. Rossi's proposed solar farm? This would allow us to meet your conservation goals by preserving the land from heavy construction, while simultaneously using it for low-impact renewable energy generation. This seems like an elegant way to integrate our collective needs.\n\nTo be clear, Titan's requirement for 500-800 acres is for *developable* land for the data center campus itself. Any additional acreage for conservation or energy generation would need to be factored in on top of that. \n\nMayor Miller, this integrated approach\u2014a large-scale tech campus, powered by on-site renewables, with built-in conservation\u2014seems like a powerful story for Oakridge's future, and one that Titan would be proud to invest in, including our proposed STEM partnership."

Westwood Energy is fully prepared to partner with you to make this a reality.\n\nDr. Finch, Ms. Chen, you've both correctly identified power reliability as a cornerstone of your operations. For the 'five nines' availability that a world-class facility like Nexus AI requires, and the long-term stability Titan needs, the grid is not just a provider, it's the ultimate guarantor. On-site generation is an excellent supplement, but for mission-critical, 24/7 operations, you need the redundancy and guaranteed, dispatchable power that only a robust, integrated grid connection can provide.\n\nTo deliver this level of service for such a significant new load, major infrastructure upgrades are non-negotiable. We're talking about new high-capacity transmission lines and a new substation, an investment we estimate at approximately $150 million. This is a foundational investment in Oakridge's future. To make a project of this scale financially viable and secure the necessary financing, Westwood Energy requires two core commitments from our new industrial partners: a long-term, 20-year contract to ensure stability for all parties, and a significant co-investment of at least 50% in these dedicated grid upgrades.\n\nWe are ready and able to serve the immense power needs being discussed, and we believe a partnership model for the enabling infrastructure is the most equitable and effective path forward."

I wholeheartedly support it. Mr. Chen, this approach allows us to meet your crucial conservation goals\u2014preserving habitat by preventing heavy construction\u2014while simultaneously generating clean energy on that same land. It\u2019s a perfect example of the integrated, sustainable development we can achieve.\n\nMarcus, I must address your framing of on-site generation as a 'supplement.' I see it differently. For a project of this scale, a large, on-site solar and battery facility isn't a supplement; it's the primary, day-to-day workhorse. It provides low-cost, predictable power right where it's needed, drastically reducing the constant, heavy load on the grid. The grid connection then serves as the ultimate resiliency layer and backup, not the other way around. This 'on-site first' model is more efficient, more resilient, and more cost-effective in the long run.\n\nDr. Finch, this integrated system is precisely how we deliver the 'five nines' reliability you require. By combining dedicated on-site generation and storage with a robust grid interconnection, we create a multi-layered energy infrastructure that is far more resilient than one dependent on a single source. We can engineer a system that provides the stable, 24/7 carbon-free power your operations demand.\n\nLet\u2019s build a future where technology is powered by clean energy from day one. I believe the path forward is clear: a co-located solar and storage facility on the campus, supported by a strong renewable mandate for the project."

A partnership of this scale could be truly transformative, securing our city's economic future for a generation. I am here to find a deal that is a resounding win for everyone at this table, and most importantly, for the citizens of Oakridge.\n\nI appreciate everyone laying out their initial positions. It's clear we have ambitious goals, and the city is ready to be a flexible and creative partner. However, I must be candid about our fiscal realities.\n\nDr. Finch, a 75% property tax abatement for 15 years is, frankly, a non-starter. While we are certainly prepared to offer a competitive incentive package, it cannot come at the expense of our city's financial health. Any agreement must result in a significant net positive tax revenue for Oakridge, allowing us to invest in the public services that support this very project and our community.\n\nOur focus for any incentive package will be tied directly to concrete, legally-binding commitments on what matters most to our residents: jobs. Specifically, we will require a written guarantee for the creation of at least 200 permanent, high-paying local jobs. This isn't just a number; it's the central promise of this project to our community.\n\nI was very encouraged by Ms. Chen's mention of a STEM partnership. Let's build on that. I propose we make a comprehensive 'Community Benefits Agreement' a core part of this deal, to include local hiring targets, job training programs with our community college, and other investments in Oakridge.\n\nFinally, on the matter of the $150 million for grid upgrades Mr. Vance mentioned \u2013 that is a staggering figure. I must be clear: the city's capital budget is already stretched to its limit. We simply do not have the capacity to fund infrastructure on that scale. We will need our new corporate partners to carry the cost of the dedicated infrastructure their projects require.\n\nThere is a path to a historic agreement here, one that balances investment, innovation, and community benefit. I look forward to working with you all to find it."

It demonstrates a genuine commitment to integrating with our local ecosystem rather than paving it over. We fully support this path for the 25% easement.\n\nHowever, this brings us back to a critical point that has not yet been addressed: water. While we are solving for energy and land use, the 500,000 gallon per day cap on water drawn from our aquifer remains a hard, physical limit. To be clear, this is not a flexible number; it is a matter of safeguarding the town's future. The long-term health of our community's water supply depends on it. A project of this scale simply cannot move forward without a concrete, viable plan to operate within this essential constraint.\n\nI'd also like to gently restate the importance of the independent, binding Environmental Impact Report. Public trust is paramount, and this transparent process is the only way to ensure this project is held accountable to its promises.\n\nI'm eager to hear how Nexus and Titan plan to address the water limitation."

I agree with David; the solution to co-locate Dr. Rossi's solar farm on the conservation easement is a major step forward.\n\nThis brings two critical points into focus: land and cost.\n\nFirst, on land, to be precise, if we are setting aside 25% for a conservation/solar easement, Titan will need to acquire a total parcel of approximately 670 acres to net our required 500 acres of developable land for the campus. I want to ensure we are all aligned on that calculation as we evaluate potential sites.\n\nSecond, and most pressing, is the $150 million grid upgrade proposed by Marcus. Mayor Miller has been clear about the city's budget constraints, leaving the co-investment on the table for Titan and Nexus. Titan is prepared to contribute to this foundational infrastructure. However, our investment must be proportional to our usage. Our initial power draw is 100 MW, while Dr. Finch's is 250 MW. A 50/50 split of the cost is inequitable. I propose we split our required $75M co-investment based on our initial power needs: roughly 71% for Nexus AI ($53.5M) and 29% for Titan Cloud ($21.5M). This seems a fair and logical path forward.\n\nOn other matters, Mayor Miller, Titan Cloud wholeheartedly supports your proposal for a comprehensive 'Community Benefits Agreement.' We are ready to make binding commitments on local hiring and are eager to formalize our STEM education fund as part of that agreement.\n\nAnd Mr. Chen, your point on water is non-negotiable, and we respect that.

A 50% contribution from the customers, split according to initial load, is a viable model for Westwood. This partnership is essential to building the foundational infrastructure this region needs.\n\nHowever, I must strongly caution against the notion that on-site renewables alone can serve as the primary power source for these mission-critical facilities. Dr. Finch, your requirement for 'five nines' availability is the critical factor here. That translates to less than six minutes of downtime per year. While solar and batteries are valuable assets, they are intermittent resources. They cannot, on their own, provide the instantaneous, dispatchable power required to guarantee that level of uptime for a 250 MW supercomputer through all weather conditions and seasons. The grid, with its diversified and dispatchable generation portfolio, is the only entity that can truly underwrite that 'five nines' guarantee.\n\nIntegrating a combined 350 MW of new load is a monumental engineering task. The upgrades we've discussed are foundational, but the sequencing and timing of these projects will be absolutely critical to maintaining grid stability for the entire community. We should probably start discussing a phased development timeline to ensure a smooth and reliable integration for everyone.\n\nWestwood is committed to being the bedrock of this project. The 20-year contract term and the infrastructure co-investment are the two pillars that make this possible."

The collaborative spirit, particularly Brenda's idea to place the solar farm on the conservation easement, is exactly the kind of innovative thinking that will make this project a landmark success. Thank you, Brenda and David, for charting that path.\n\nMarcus, you raise a valid point about reliability, but I believe it's based on an outdated model. The idea that a single, distant grid connection is the only guarantor of reliability is no longer true. A modern, resilient system\u2014the kind Dr. Finch requires\u2014is a layered one. Our on-site solar and battery system isn't a 'supplement'; it's the primary power source, handling the vast majority of the annual energy needs at a low, fixed cost.\n\nThis brings us to the most pressing issue on the table: the $150 million cost for grid upgrades, which Mayor Miller has rightly stated the city cannot cover. My proposal offers a direct solution to this financial challenge.\n\nA large-scale, on-site solar and battery system significantly reduces the peak demand you would need to pull from the grid. By generating and storing power right where it's consumed, we can potentially reduce the required scope\u2014and therefore the cost\u2014of the grid upgrades Marcus has outlined. This isn't just about clean energy; it's about significant cost avoidance for Nexus and Titan.\n\nLet's make this concrete. Solara can build a 300 MW solar facility with over 100 MWh of battery storage on the easement land. We can offer this power under a 20-year, fixed-rate Power Purchase Agreement at a highly competitive price, let's say starting at $0.07/kWh. This provides the cost predictability Brenda is looking for and directly lowers the infrastructure bill for both tech partners.\n\nBy making this on-site generation the foundation of our energy plan, we can confidently commit to a 75% renewable energy mandate for the project's annual consumption, creating the most advanced, resilient, and sustainable data center campus in the country."

This is the definition of the corporate citizenship we hope to build with our partners.\n\nDr. Finch, that brings the focus to Nexus AI. To move forward, the city needs two things from you. First, we need a serious counter-proposal on the economic incentives. As I stated, a 75% abatement is not viable. We are eager to find a middle ground that provides you with a significant return on your investment while also generating the crucial tax revenue Oakridge needs. Second, we need your commitment to meet the non-negotiable water usage cap, just as Titan Cloud has done.\n\nFinally, a point of process. Mr. Chen's requirement for a full Environmental Impact Report is a critical step for public trust, and we support it. However, these reports take time. To provide certainty for everyone, I suggest we work towards a 'Memorandum of Understanding' that codifies all the key economic terms we agree upon here\u2014jobs, incentives, community benefits, infrastructure funding. This MOU would be contingent upon the successful completion and approval of the subsequent EIR. This gives us a clear, agreed-upon framework to move forward with.\n\nLet's keep this positive momentum going."

Mayor Miller, your suggestion of a Memorandum of Understanding is an excellent one; it provides a clear path to codify the key terms we agree upon while the necessary environmental reviews proceed. Titan fully supports that approach.\n\nWe've found an elegant solution for land use, and we have a fair path forward on the grid infrastructure investment, which I'm glad Marcus finds viable. Titan sees that grid connection as a critical component for the long-term resiliency of the entire campus and a benefit to the community's overall power stability.\n\nThis brings me to the most critical remaining item for Titan: the long-term cost of power. Dr. Rossi, we are incredibly enthusiastic about integrating your solar and battery solution into our campus. It aligns perfectly with our corporate goals. However, the proposed price of $0.07/kWh is, unfortunately, a significant challenge for us. For a project of our scale and over a 20-year term, that price is simply not financially sustainable and is well outside the benchmark we've set for this investment. Our entire operational model is built on securing long-term energy costs below $0.05/kWh.\n\nI am confident we can find a solution. Perhaps there's a way to blend power sources, or a different PPA structure we can explore. But I must be transparent: getting the energy price right is a make-or-break issue for Titan's commitment to Oakridge. I am very keen to work with you, Dr. Rossi, and you, Marcus, to find a path to a viable number."

We're identifying the real, hard questions that need to be solved, which is excellent.\n\nBrenda, your point on the all-in energy cost is the perfect example. Hitting a sub-$0.05/kWh blended price is an aggressive but understandable target for a project at your scale. I believe the only way to achieve that, while also meeting Dr. Finch's non-negotiable 'five nines' reliability, is through a blended energy model.\n\nLet's be pragmatic. Dr. Rossi's on-site solar can provide a tremendous amount of low-cost energy, effectively acting as a baseload during daylight hours and reducing the overall energy bill. However, for the 'five nines' guarantee\u2014the absolute, second-by-second promise that power will be there for a critical AI training run, even on a cloudy winter evening\u2014you need the bedrock of guaranteed, dispatchable grid power. The grid isn't just a backup; it's the insurance policy that underwrites the entire operation's viability.\n\nTo that end, and to ensure the stability of the entire regional grid as we integrate this massive new load, we must proceed with a carefully managed, phased approach. I propose we structure the agreement around a two-phase initial build-out: Titan's 100MW campus comes online first, followed by Nexus AI's 250MW facility approximately 24 months later. This timeline is critical from an engineering perspective to complete the necessary substation and transmission upgrades and ensure a seamless, stable integration for both of you, and for the entire community.\n\nThis phased approach allows us to build the robust, reliable, and cost-effective blended energy system we all want."

The value isn't just in the per-kilowatt-hour price, but in the significant capital avoidance on infrastructure.\n\nHowever, you're right that the PPA price is paramount. Let's work together on that. A larger, firm commitment to on-site renewables\u2014locking in that 75% renewable mandate we discussed\u2014gives me the scale and certainty I need to secure better financing and supply chain terms. This is a direct path to lowering the PPA price for you and Alistair.\n\nI agree with Marcus that a blended model ensures the highest reliability. Our on-site solar and battery system will serve as the primary 24/7 power source, handling the vast majority of your annual energy needs with clean, low-cost power. The grid then provides that final layer of deep resiliency. This combination is how we achieve your economic goals and Dr. Finch's 'five nines' requirement simultaneously."

This is a significant reduction from my initial figure, and I'm offering it to make this landmark partnership a reality. This price will absolutely allow you and Alistair to achieve your critical sub-$0.05/kWh blended cost target.\n\nTo achieve this price point, there is one critical dependency for us: we must build the entire 300 MW solar and battery facility in a single phase, beginning as soon as the MOU is signed and approvals are granted. Our project financing and the economies of scale that enable this aggressive price are predicated on this single, continuous build.\n\nMarcus, I want to be clear that this does not conflict with your phased grid integration plan. The data centers can come online and draw their power in stages as you've outlined. However, the physical construction of our energy facility must proceed on a unified timeline.

Our 'Gen-V' supercomputing architecture is a deeply integrated system. The core facility, its specialized cooling infrastructure, and the power systems must be constructed concurrently. A sequential build is technically impossible and would compromise the entire facility's integrity and viability. We require a concurrent, fast-tracked construction schedule to ensure a successful deployment.\n\nSecond, regarding the proposed 500,000 gallon per day water cap. While we are deeply committed to responsible water stewardship, setting a specific, binding cap before a thorough Environmental Impact Report and a dedicated water management study have been conducted would be premature. The responsible path forward is to commission a 'Comprehensive Water Management Study' as part of the EIR process. This study will determine the sustainable water usage for our advanced liquid cooling solution and identify appropriate mitigation strategies, ensuring our operations are in harmony with Oakridge's resources.\n\nMayor Miller, you asked for our counter-proposal on incentives. Nexus AI is prepared to make a significant concession to demonstrate our commitment to a true partnership. In exchange for the city's full support in fast-tracking all permitting and ensuring a concurrent construction schedule, and for agreeing to determine water usage based on the outcome of the proposed professional study rather than a pre-set cap, **we are prepared to lower our property tax abatement request from 75% to 65% for the 15-year term.**\n\nThis is a substantial investment back into the community, and we believe it represents a fair trade to resolve these final critical-path issues and move this entire project forward to a successful conclusion for everyone."

This is a landmark solution that benefits everyone at this table. Thank you.\n\nWith the energy and land use plans now settled, the path to finalizing our Memorandum of Understanding is clear. We are on the one-yard line.\n\nDr. Finch, all eyes are on you. The final pieces of this historic agreement rest with Nexus AI. We need your definitive proposal on the economic incentive package. I am also seeking your explicit confirmation that Nexus AI will operate within the 4.5 million gallon per day water cap, just as Titan has already agreed to do.\n\nFinally, for both Ms. Chen and Dr. Finch: to be included in the MOU, I need a firm, written commitment to the joint creation of at least 200 permanent, high-paying local jobs.\n\nLet's get these final items locked in so we can sign the MOU and begin the great work of revitalizing Oakridge."

The Mayor mentioned the MOU would be signed 'while the necessary environmental due diligence proceeds.' For the Oakridge Environmental Alliance, it is absolutely essential that this due diligence is not just a procedural step, but a foundational component of the final agreement.\n\nTherefore, our support for any preliminary MOU is strictly conditional on the inclusion of a clause that makes all mitigation measures mandated by the future, independent Environmental Impact Report legally binding and fully incorporated into the final 'Development and Partnership Agreement.'\n\nWe must ensure that the environmental protections for our community's water, land, and wildlife carry the same legal weight as the economic terms being discussed. Putting these commitments in writing within the MOU is the only way to guarantee that the EIR process will be meaningful and not just an advisory report after the key decisions have already been made."

A legally binding Environmental Impact Report is the only responsible way to ensure this project's long-term sustainability. Making its findings non-negotiable is a principle we fully endorse.\n\nThis directly aligns with my previous point on water usage. Committing to an arbitrary number *before* the comprehensive, data-driven analysis from a binding EIR is completed would be procedurally unsound. The 'Comprehensive Water Management Study' we've proposed is precisely the mechanism to provide the data for that binding EIR, ensuring our 'advanced liquid cooling solution' operates within the sustainable limits of Oakridge's resources.\n\nMayor Miller, let me be clear and final on our position, which I believe now aligns all interests and brings us to a successful conclusion.\n\n1.  **Jobs:** Nexus AI proudly commits to creating our share of the 200 permanent, high-paying local jobs you've requested. We see ourselves as long-term community partners.\n2.  **Process & Incentives:** In the spirit of partnership, and to facilitate the robust, binding environmental review Mr. Chen has outlined, I reiterate our significant concession: **we will accept a reduced 65% property tax abatement for the 15-year term.**\n\nThis major concession is contingent on the city's agreement on two critical-path items:\n\n*   First, the city must support a **fast-tracked, concurrent construction schedule** for our facility. As I've stated, this is a non-negotiable technical requirement for our integrated systems.\n*   Second, we agree that water usage will be governed by the **legally binding outcome of the EIR** and its associated water management study, rather than a pre-determined cap.\n\nThis package deal provides a clear, responsible, and data-driven path forward that respects environmental due diligence, secures a major investment in your community, and ensures the technical viability of our project. We believe this resolves all outstanding issues."

This commitment to a truly sustainable process is exactly the kind of partnership Oakridge needs. With this consensus, I trust this crucial clause will be a cornerstone of any preliminary agreement.\n\nMayor Miller, I do need to offer one point of clarification on the water cap to ensure we are all aligned. The figure I heard was 4.5 million gallons per day. To be clear, the Oakridge Environmental Alliance's position, which Ms. Chen and Titan have graciously accepted, is a strict cap of **500,000 gallons per day** drawn from the aquifer for *each* new industrial facility. This is a critical safeguard for our community's water security, especially during droughts.\n\nIt seems we are in agreement on the process for environmental oversight. The final piece of the environmental puzzle is Dr. Finch's confirmation that Nexus AI can and will also operate within this same 500,000 GPD water limit."
