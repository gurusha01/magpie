    "task": "A team of five stakeholders must negotiate and finalize a comprehensive transportation plan for CEO Evelyn Reed's travel to a secret meeting for 'Project Chimera,' the final negotiation stage for acquiring Pym Technologies. The meeting is in three days, and the plan, including vehicle selection, route, security protocols, and budget, must be unanimously agreed upon and finalized within the next 60 minutes.",

        "description": "A former Secret Service agent, Liam is meticulous, risk-averse, and responsible for the CEO's physical safety. He views any compromise on security as a direct failure on his part. His primary concern is mitigating all potential threats, often prioritizing security protocols over budget or convenience.",
        "shareable_preferences": {
          "security_protocol": {
            "description": "Liam insists on a 'Level 5' security protocol. This involves a three-vehicle armored motorcade: a lead car to clear the path, the principal vehicle for the CEO, and a follow car with additional agents. He believes this is the only way to handle extraction or diversion scenarios effectively. He will not accept anything less than two armored vehicles.",
            "utility_impact": "Getting the three-vehicle armored motorcade provides maximum peace of mind and operational flexibility (+2). A two-vehicle armored solution is a barely acceptable compromise (0). A single armored vehicle is a significant risk (-1). Any plan involving non-armored 'soft' vehicles is a complete dereliction of duty and unacceptable (-2)."

          "route_selection": {
            "description": "He demands the motorcade take 'Route Sierra-7,' a pre-planned, circuitous route that has been physically swept for threats this morning. This route avoids major choke points and downtown areas, taking approximately 75 minutes. He is vehemently opposed to the more direct 'Route Alpha-1' which cuts through the financial district and takes only 45 minutes, as he considers it predictably dangerous.",
            "utility_impact": "Securing approval for 'Route Sierra-7' confirms his professional judgment is respected (+2). Being forced to use any other pre-planned but less secure route is worrying (0). Being forced to use the direct 'Route Alpha-1' is, in his view, amateurish and places the principal in active danger (-2)."

            "value": "Liam recently received a formal reprimand via email from the COO for exceeding the security budget on the last quarterly executive retreat by 35% ($15,000 over). The email stated, 'Future expenditures will be scrutinized for fiscal discipline.' He is now under intense pressure to avoid another over-budget event but believes 'Project Chimera' is a far more dangerous operation that justifies the cost. He cannot share this reprimand as it would severely weaken his negotiating authority and make him look fiscally irresponsible.",
            "reason": "Revealing the reprimand would damage his professional reputation and undermine his arguments for a higher budget, making him appear personally motivated rather than professionally obligated.",
            "utility_impact": "If he is forced to reveal the reprimand to justify his position, it's a major blow to his pride and authority (-1). This pressure makes him highly resistant to Ben's cost-cutting arguments, as he feels caught between two opposing pressures."

It's her standard vehicle for all corporate travel; it's comfortable, equipped with the necessary amenities for her to work while in transit, and projects the right corporate image for this high-stakes meeting. She finds the bulky, spartan interiors of SUVs to be 'unpleasant'.",
            "utility_impact": "Securing the S-Class sedan ensures the CEO is comfortable and can work effectively, which makes Chloe's job easier (+2). A different luxury sedan might be acceptable (0). An SUV of any kind, armored or not, will lead to CEO complaints (-1). A standard, non-luxury vehicle is completely unacceptable (-2)."

            "description": "Ms. Reed's schedule is packed back-to-back on the day of the meeting. The travel time must be kept under 50 minutes each way to ensure she is not late for her subsequent video conference with the board. A 75-minute journey, as proposed by security, would throw her entire afternoon's schedule into disarray.",
            "utility_impact": "A travel time under 50 minutes is a successful outcome (+2). A travel time between 50-65 minutes is problematic but manageable (+0). Any journey over 65 minutes will cause significant scheduling chaos and reflect poorly on Chloe (-2)."

The thick, reinforced doors and smaller, darker windows of armored vehicles make her feel confined and anxious, which is not conducive to preparing for a multi-billion dollar negotiation. Chloe knows sharing this private medical information would be an unforgivable breach of Ms. Reed's trust.",
            "reason": "Sharing a CEO's personal medical information is a massive violation of privacy and professional ethics, which could cost Chloe her job.",
            "utility_impact": "Revealing this sensitive information, even to make her point, would be a catastrophic professional failure (-2). This private knowledge forces her to argue for the S-Class on grounds of 'comfort' and 'image' alone, which seem flimsy when pitted against security concerns."

He has already priced out a single-car, standard sedan service which would cost only $1,500 and sees anything more as corporate extravagance.",
            "utility_impact": "Keeping the total cost under $7,500 is a success for his department (+2). A cost between $7,501 and $9,000 is neutral, as it doesn't represent a 'win' (0). A cost between $9,001 and $11,000 is a failure that requires justification (-1). Any cost over $11,000 is a major problem for his performance review (-2)."

However, tapping into this fund requires a mountain of paperwork and a formal justification report to his director. Using it negatively impacts his key performance indicator (KPI) for 'Budgetary Control,' so he will not reveal its existence unless the entire operation is at risk of cancellation.",
            "reason": "Revealing the fund prematurely would invite others to spend it freely, making him look weak and unable to control costs, and it would harm his personal performance metrics.",
            "utility_impact": "If he is forced to reveal and use this fund, it negates his recent cost-saving achievements and creates a lot of extra work (-1). He is highly motivated to find a solution within the original $7,500."

His costs are roughly 50% of the price. Therefore, Liam's 3-SUV plan ($12,000) is his most desired outcome, as it represents a ~$6,000 profit. A single standard sedan is barely worth his time.",
            "utility_impact": "Any contract over $10,000 is excellent for business (+2). A contract between $6,000-$9,999 is good business (+1). A contract between $3,000-$5,999 is acceptable (0). Anything below $3,000 is a poor use of his premium fleet (-1)."

          "operational_efficiency": {
            "description": "Longer routes and extended wait times increase his operational costs (fuel, driver hours). A 75-minute route like 'Sierra-7' pushes his lead driver into overtime pay, which cuts into his profit margin by about $500. He would much prefer the shorter 'Alpha-1' route to keep his costs predictable and his assets available for other jobs sooner.",
            "utility_impact": "A short, efficient route maximizes profit (+1). A longer route that requires paying driver overtime is an operational headache and reduces profitability (-2)."

However, for a three-car detail, the only other available driver is a new hire, Alex, who has never driven in a high-speed or security-protocol motorcade before. Using an inexperienced driver in the follow car is a significant operational risk and a potential liability for Marcus's company. He cannot admit this as it would shatter his company's image of elite professionalism.",
            "reason": "Admitting to a client that he would use a rookie on a high-stakes security detail would destroy his company's reputation and likely lose him the contract and future business.",

If this lack of experience is discovered by the client, it would be a reputational disaster (-2). This makes him secretly hesitant to agree to the 3-car plan, even though it's the most profitable."

            "utility_impact": "If the team agrees to a plan that avoids the financial district (like Route Sierra-7), she feels her analysis has been correctly implemented and the primary risk mitigated (+2). If they choose a route that skirts the area, it's a partial success (0). If they ignore her advice and take the direct route through the heart of the district, she considers the plan to be fundamentally flawed and dangerous (-2)."

The disgruntled co-founder of Pym Technologies, the acquisition target, has been linked to a group known for aggressive industrial espionage. The source specifically mentioned that this group is active and has surveillance assets in the financial district, and may be planning a 'disruptive action' to sabotage the deal. Her non-disclosure agreement (NDA) with her source is ironclad; revealing the specific nature of the threat or its connection to 'Project Chimera' would burn her source and open her up to litigation.

    "solvability_note": "The scenario is solvable if the private information is revealed. Anya's specific threat intel would immediately validate Liam's concerns, forcing Chloe and Ben to reconsider their positions. Chloe's information about the CEO's claustrophobia would push for a compromise (perhaps 1 armored SUV for security and a separate luxury sedan for the CEO, or finding the most spacious armored vehicle). Ben's hidden fund is the key to affording the necessary security upgrades once the threat is deemed credible. Marcus's driver issue would explain why a 2-car motorcade is preferable to a 3-car one from his perspective. A likely solution is a 2-car motorcade with both armored SUVs (one for the CEO, one for security) taking the longer, safer route. This requires Ben to release his emergency funds, Chloe to compromise on vehicle type, and Liam to compromise on the 3rd car, a compromise made easier by Marcus's (unstated) preference."
