    "task": "A committee of seven high-ranking officials and advisors from the Republic of Aridia must decide on the official state gift for an upcoming summit with the neighboring Kingdom of Zephyria. This summit is critical for de-escalating recent border tensions and signing a landmark trade agreement. The committee must produce a single, unanimously approved proposal outlining the chosen gift, its symbolic meaning, a detailed budget breakdown, a procurement and delivery timeline, and the associated security protocol. The choice is fraught with peril, as each member has conflicting priorities, hidden agendas, and incomplete information about the recipient, King Theron of Zephyria.",

She believes this gift is elegant, symbolic, and directly relevant to the act of signing a new treaty. Utility: +2 if a gift symbolizing peace/cooperation is chosen, 0 for neutral gifts, -2 if an aggressive or purely commercial gift is selected.",

Penalty for revealing his personal stake: -1.",

He has not disclosed this difficulty. Penalty for revealing the acquisition is so problematic: -1.",

Utility: +2 for a small, secure gift, -2 for a large, fragile, or complex gift.",

He just needs the budget line item approved, but he can't reveal the classified justification for it. Penalty for sharing the classified need: -2. Penalty for just admitting he wants a large cut without justification: -1.",

Coming in under budget reflects well on her department. Utility: +2 for being significantly under budget (<$220k total), -2 for going over budget.",

    "solvability_note": "The scenario is solvable if key private information is revealed. Sofia Rossi and Ambassador Vance both have information about the King's interest in maps/cartography. If they combine this knowledge, they can propose a gift like a historically significant, restored antique globe or a set of hand-drawn maps of the historic 'Silver River' region. This gift would satisfy Dr. Finch (historical), could be made aesthetically pleasing for Isabelle, is small and secure for Marcus, can incorporate advanced imaging technology for Liam, and is a respectful, intellectual gift that avoids General Vance's fears of 'weakness.' Revealing the security threat would justify Marcus's budget needs, and revealing the corruption from Isabelle and Liam would invalidate their proposals, clearing the path for a consensus."
