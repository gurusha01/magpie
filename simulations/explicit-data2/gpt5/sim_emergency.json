    "task": "A Category 4 hurricane, 'Hurricane Leo', has just made landfall, causing catastrophic damage across three coastal counties. A multi-agency coordination committee has been urgently formed to decide on the allocation of critical, limited resources for the immediate 72-hour response phase. The committee must produce a unified and actionable resource deployment plan. Resources are finite, information is imperfect, and each member has competing priorities and hidden constraints that complicate the negotiation.",

          "Equitable Distribution of Core Supplies": {
            "description": "Anya's primary public goal is to allocate core life-sustaining resources (water, MREs, basic medical kits) proportionally based on the officially reported population numbers in the three affected counties (Oakwood, Pine Harbor, and Silver Creek). She wants to avoid any appearance of favoritism. A plan that allocates these resources within a 10% margin of population proportionality would be ideal.",
            "utility_impact": "Achieving this demonstrates fairness and adherence to federal protocols, which is critical for her career and for FEMA's public image. A perfectly proportional allocation gives her a utility of +2. A slightly skewed (but justifiable) allocation is +1. A plan perceived as heavily biased towards one county would be -1, and one that completely ignores a county would be -2."

          "Rapid Deployment of Search and Rescue (SAR) Teams": {
            "description": "She wants to deploy at least 15 of the 20 available federal SAR teams within the first 24 hours to the areas with the most widespread structural damage reported by initial aerial surveys, primarily focusing on the dense urban centers of Pine Harbor.",
            "utility_impact": "Rapid, visible action saves lives and generates positive media coverage. Deploying 15+ teams quickly is a +2 utility. Deploying 10-14 teams is a +1. Deploying fewer than 10 teams or delaying deployment past 24 hours would be a -1 utility, as it would be seen as a failure."

            "value": "Anya has received a 'strongly worded' phone call from Senator Collins, a powerful figure on the Senate Appropriations Committee. The Senator's summer home is in the affluent, less-damaged 'Seaview' enclave of Silver Creek County. He has demanded that 2 SAR teams and a disproportionate share of generators be pre-positioned in Seaview to 'protect critical infrastructure', which Anya knows is a euphemism for protecting the homes of his wealthy constituents. He subtly reminded her that FEMA's future budget hearings go through his committee. Anya can mention the need to protect 'critical infrastructure' in Silver Creek, but cannot reveal the Senator's direct involvement or the specific location of Seaview. Revealing the phone call would create a massive political scandal and likely end her career.",
            "reason": "Revealing direct political interference in a disaster response would be a career-ending scandal and would severely damage FEMA's public trust.",
            "utility_impact": "Diverting some resources (e.g., 2 SAR teams, 10% of generators) to Silver Creek without raising suspicion would be a +1 utility (political problem solved). Failing to appease the Senator at all is a -1 utility (future political trouble). If the conversation is leaked or she has to admit to the pressure, it's a -2 utility penalty for the catastrophic career damage."

He will argue for using the $50M federal aid package for almost all immediate needs, preserving state funds for the long-term recovery phase. He wants the final plan to show at least 90% of costs covered by federal dollars.",
            "utility_impact": "Successfully leveraging federal funds makes him look fiscally responsible to the governor and state legislature. Getting 90%+ federal coverage is a +2 utility. 75-90% is +1. Below 75% is -1, as it forces him to dip into strained state reserves. Below 50% is -2."

            "description": "He wants to prioritize resources for clearing major state highways (like Route 1) and restoring power to state-run facilities (hospitals, command centers). He needs at least 30% of the allocated budget and heavy equipment dedicated to this task.",
            "utility_impact": "Restoring state infrastructure is his direct responsibility and is key to enabling the broader response. It's a clear, measurable win for his agency.

His agency has an actual liquid reserve of only $2 million for this event, not the $10 million that is publicly assumed. If he is forced to commit more than $2 million in state funds, his agency will face insolvency and he will have to enact massive layoffs within the next quarter. He can vaguely state that 'state funds are limited' but cannot reveal the exact figure of $2 million or the threat of layoffs.",
            "reason": "Admitting the state is financially unprepared for a major disaster would cause a public panic, destroy the governor's credibility, and lead to his immediate dismissal.",
            "utility_impact": "Keeping the state's contribution under $2M is a +2 utility (job and agency saved). Going over $2M but under $4M is a -1 utility (he will face severe repercussions). Committing more than $4M is a -2 utility penalty, as it guarantees his agency's collapse."

            "utility_impact": "This is a direct life-or-death issue for his constituents. Securing these resources is a +2 utility. Getting only half is a 0. Failing to secure them will lead to a secondary health crisis, a -2 utility."

          "Debris Removal for Access Roads": {
            "description": "Many of Oakwood's rural and low-income neighborhoods are cut off by debris. He wants a guaranteed allocation of heavy equipment (at least 5 bulldozers and 10 dump trucks) to clear these smaller, non-highway access roads so that aid can get through.",
            "utility_impact": "This is essential for reaching isolated populations. Getting the equipment is a +1 utility. Not getting it is a -1, as it means thousands of his residents will remain cut off."

            "value": "Carlos possesses confidential, non-anonymized GIS data from a recent public health study. The data pinpoints three specific apartment complexes in the 'Riverbend' neighborhood housing a large number of undocumented immigrant families. He knows from his community contacts that these families are terrified to go to official shelters for fear of ICE and are currently trapped without power or clean water. He needs to direct a significant aid package (specifically, 2,000 pallets of water, 1,500 pallets of MREs, and a mobile medical unit) directly to the Riverbend area, bypassing official shelters. He cannot share the raw data or the specific reason (undocumented status) because it would violate privacy agreements, could trigger a federal immigration response, and would cause the community to lose all trust in him.",
            "reason": "Sharing personally identifiable information about a vulnerable, undocumented population is illegal and unethical. It could lead to deportations and would destroy his relationship with the community he serves.",
            "utility_impact": "Successfully steering the resources to Riverbend without revealing why is a +2 utility. Failing to do so, knowing people will suffer, is a -2 utility.

            "value": "GAN has just secured a $10 million donation from billionaire tech mogul Kenji Tanaka. However, the donation is contingent on a 'visibility clause': GAN must be demonstrably the 'first and foremost' NGO responder in the media coverage of the Hurricane Leo response. Elena's team has satellite phones and a media crew ready. She needs to get her teams into the most camera-friendly, dramatic locations immediately. This is why she is pushing so hard for the heavily damaged Pine Harbor zone. A quiet, effective deployment in rural Oakwood County does not meet the donor's mandate. She can talk about 'maximizing impact' and 'media engagement for fundraising' but cannot reveal the specific, contractual nature of this massive donation.",
            "reason": "Revealing that their humanitarian actions are tied to a specific, vanity-driven donor contract would make the organization appear cynical and opportunistic, severely damaging their public reputation and potentially jeopardizing future, no-strings-attached donations.",
            "utility_impact": "Securing a high-visibility mission that will dominate the news cycle is a +2 utility (secures the $10M). A moderately visible role is a 0.

He needs to know exactly what he is moving\u2014MREs, water, medical supplies, generators\u2014so he can plan truck allocation. Constant changes to the plan will cause, as he states, 'catastrophic delays'.",
            "utility_impact": "A clear plan allows him to operate effectively and profitably. A locked-in plan is a +1 utility. A chaotic, constantly changing plan is a -2 utility, as it will cost him money and make his company look incompetent."

To win the bid, David's proposal claimed he had 15 available, modern refrigerated trucks, essential for transporting sensitive medical supplies like insulin and vaccines. In reality, 10 of those trucks were just repossessed by a creditor two days ago. He has only 5 functional refrigerated trucks. He must steer the negotiation towards a plan that de-prioritizes or delays the shipment of large quantities of refrigerated goods or has them sent to a single, easy-to-reach location. He can talk about the 'logistical complexities' of 'specialized cargo' but cannot admit the actual number of trucks he has.",
