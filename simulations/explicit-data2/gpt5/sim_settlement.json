The NDA must include a significant financial penalty for any breach and prohibit any public statements, interviews, or publications related to the case or CardiaCure's side effects.",

David is the only one in the room who knows this absolute ceiling. Sharing this information would completely undermine his negotiating position and would be seen as a massive failure by the board. Penalty for revealing the $150M figure: -2.",

The email explicitly states: 'Keep the total settlement liability for the CardiaCure case under $100M and your personal performance bonus for this year will be locked in at $500,000.' He is tempted to use this potential bonus as a justification for being tough, but revealing the personal financial stake would make him look unethical. Penalty for revealing the bonus link: -1.",

For her clients, this is as important as the money.",

Revealing this number would completely destroy her leverage. Penalty for revealing the $80M floor: -2.",

While standard practice, she avoids discussing it as it can make her appear motivated by money rather than justice, potentially creating distrust. Penalty for discussing the specific percentage: -1.",
            "reason": "It is considered poor form and can be used by the opposition to paint her as greedy, potentially alienating other parties or even her own clients if framed incorrectly.",

This would be a catastrophic loss, far exceeding their policy limit and exposing OmniPharm to massive out-of-pocket costs. Liam is terrified of a trial. Penalty for revealing this analysis: -2.",

She will advocate internally for whatever settlement is necessary to avoid that outcome.",

The memo flagged a 'statistically minor but potentially significant correlation with arrhythmia in canine trials' and recommended a six-month delay for further study. Her predecessor dismissed the concern and pushed the drug forward. The memo was buried. If this memo is discovered during a trial, it would be a 'smoking gun' proving OmniPharm knew of a potential risk. Penalty for revealing the memo's existence: -2.",

She will pressure David Chen to increase the offer if she feels the plaintiffs are close to walking away, because for her, a $150M settlement is infinitely better than the memo becoming public."

This reformulated version has the same efficacy but has completely eliminated the arrhythmia risk factor. A public trial about the original drug's flaws would kill the market for the new, improved, and highly profitable version before it even launches. Penalty for revealing the new drug's existence: -1.",

She argues that a simple lump sum is insufficient to protect against long-term complications.",

She fears that revealing this higher number will be dismissed as an extreme negotiating tactic and could make her side look unreasonable. Penalty for revealing the full $50M projection: -1.",

She feels an immense ethical weight to secure as large a fund as possible because she believes even her public demand might not be enough.

The plaintiffs' minimum acceptable amount ($80M) is significantly lower than the insurer's maximum payout ($125M) and the pharmaceutical company's absolute maximum authorization ($150M). The primary challenge is bridging the vast gap between the parties' opening positions and navigating the conflicting internal priorities (e.g., David's bonus vs. Evelyn's fear of the memo).
