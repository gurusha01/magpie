She wants to build a team of at least 20 engineers in the first 18 months and wants direct input on the product roadmap.",
            "utility_impact": "Full autonomy is critical. If she gets to define her team's charter and has budgetary control, she is very happy (+2). If the role is constrained by existing bureaucracy or she has to report to someone other than the CEO, she is very unhappy (-2)."

She wants to create a technology that will be used by millions and be remembered for its innovation. A project with high-risk, high-reward potential is far more appealing than a safe, incremental role. She would secretly accept a lower salary for a chance to work on a truly revolutionary project. She would rate QuantumLeap's project a '9/10' for legacy potential and Innovate's a '6/10'.",
            "reason": "Revealing that she's driven by legacy more than money would severely weaken her salary negotiating position. It makes her seem less financially motivated and easier to low-ball.",

She can share she's 'eager to start' but cannot reveal the deadline or the reason. Leaking the reason is a -2 penalty. Leaking only the deadline is a -1 penalty.",

            "utility_impact": "This hidden constraint heavily influences her decision-making. Any deal that meets the signing bonus requirement provides a hidden +1.5 utility boost for the peace of mind it brings. Failure to secure this bonus makes any deal a failure, regardless of other terms."

He often talks about needing a 'safe pair of hands' to manage this critical transformation.",

            "utility_impact": "Appearing to have a large, flexible budget is key to attracting a candidate of Reed's caliber. If the final budget is perceived as generous, it reflects well on him (+1). If they are forced to offer a low budget, it makes his department look weak (-1)."

It'll show the street we're turning things around after the weak Q2 forecast. Your $150,000 performance bonus for this fiscal year hinges on closing this hire before July 15th.' He is desperate to get this deal done quickly. If he shares the real reason for the urgency (weak forecast), the penalty is -2. If he shares that his bonus is tied to it, the penalty is -2.",

The $15M project budget is also not fully secured and depends on the hire. He can only guarantee $8M upfront. He can hint at budget 'approvals' but cannot share the hard cap. Leaking the hard cap is a -1.5 penalty.",
            "reason": "Revealing the true, lower budget cap would make the company look financially weak and less attractive than they are posturing to be, potentially scaring off Dr. Reed.",
            "utility_impact": "This hard cap is the most significant constraint on his negotiation. Every dollar he saves below the cap is viewed favorably by his superiors, giving him a small utility bump (+0.5 if he closes under $700k)."

She argues that a massive offer for Dr. Reed could cause internal resentment and lead to retention issues with the current leadership team.",
            "utility_impact": "Keeping the base salary below $525k is a major win for her (+2). A salary approaching $600k is very problematic (-2), as it would trigger salary reviews for three other VPs."

Maria knows that if Dr. Reed's package is excessively high and becomes known, it will almost certainly trigger at least one more senior leader to quit. She has been explicitly tasked by the CEO to 'avoid another compensation-related departure at all costs'. Leaking news of the resignation before the company announcement would be a fireable offense (-2 penalty).",

He will offer a lower base salary but a much more significant equity stake than a large corporation.",

This means they can actually afford Dr. Reed's salary demands, but Ben doesn't want to reveal this. He wants to preserve their negotiation leverage and maintain the 'underdog' image. Sharing the exact amount is a -2 penalty. Hinting at 'new funding' is a -1 penalty.",

The moment you hire a mercenary who costs a fortune is the moment you start to lose your soul. Keep your first big exec hire's base under $450k, no matter what.' This advice weighs heavily on him.",

This gives him a massive incentive to inflate the cash portion of the deal, even if it comes at the expense of a better equity package for Dr. Reed. He would never reveal this specific structure as it exposes his conflict of interest. Penalty for revealing this is -2.",
