The goal is to agree on a set of quantifiable, globally binding targets for emissions reduction, climate finance, and technology sharing. Failure to reach a unanimous agreement will result in the collapse of the talks, likely deferring meaningful global action for another decade and pushing the world past critical climate tipping points.",
