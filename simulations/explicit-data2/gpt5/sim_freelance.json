    "solvability_note": "The scenario is solvable if private information is revealed. The initial positions are irreconcilable: the budget is too low for the timeline and scope. However, revealing David's hidden $25k fund can satisfy the freelancers' rate requirements and asset budgets. Revealing Ben's vacation and Raj's family commitments makes the October 15th deadline for the full scope impossible, forcing Sarah to re-evaluate. Her bonus pressure can be addressed by proposing a phased launch, allowing her to meet her deadline with core features. Chloe's desire for a portfolio piece might allow for some cost-saving on the design for the data-viz module. This shared knowledge allows the team to negotiate a realistic scope, timeline, and budget that works for everyone."
