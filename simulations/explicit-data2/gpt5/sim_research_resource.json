My experiments involve time-sensitive protein crystallization and imaging processes that cannot be paused and restarted without compromising months of sample preparation. Fragmented access would render my entire dataset useless. Anything less than 3,000 hours is a non-starter.",
            "utility_impact": "This is my primary goal. Getting >= 4000 hours is a +2 utility. Getting between 3000-3999 hours is a +1. Getting 1500-2999 is a -1 as it jeopardizes the project. Less than 1500 hours is a -2, as it guarantees project failure."

My preliminary data suggests I am weeks away from a structure that could redefine Alzheimer's research and lead to new therapeutic pathways. I can only share that my research is at a 'critical phase.' Revealing the exact proximity without the final data would be career suicide if I'm wrong or get scooped (Penalty: -2).",

Through a recently published conference proceeding abstract, I've deduced that their methodology is flawed, putting them at least 6-8 months behind me. However, they are famously well-funded and could overcome this gap quickly if they realize their error. I cannot share this information. Sharing that I am monitoring a rival's progress so closely would be seen as paranoid and unprofessional academic conduct (Penalty: -2). I can vaguely mention 'competitive pressures in the field' (Penalty: 0).",

No single lab should receive more than 50% (3,000 hours) of the total time. This strategy diversifies our research portfolio and maximizes the potential for multiple high-impact publications, strengthening the university's reputation.",

I have received a confidential email from the Provost that reads: 'Lena, the board is watching the Cryo-EM purchase closely. We need to see at least 3-4 publications in progress citing its use by the Q3 review, or we'll have to cut your department's capital expenditure budget for the next five years.' I absolutely cannot share this. Revealing it would cause widespread panic, show administrative weakness, and undermine my negotiating position (Penalty: -2). I can only state that we need to 'demonstrate strong ROI for our investments this fiscal year' (Penalty: 0).",

This is non-negotiable and a core tenet of our 'Broadening Participation' mission.",

            "description": "To foster collaboration, the grant also stipulated that researchers from affiliated regional institutions would have access. I need to see a clear plan that reserves at least 500 hours for these external users. This demonstrates that the instrument is a regional hub, not a private tool for one university.",
            "utility_impact": "Allocating >= 500 hours for external users is a +1 utility. Anything less is a 0, but failing to allocate any time would be a -1."

I recently received an internal memo marked 'CONFIDENTIAL: Internal Review Only' stating that projects failing to show collaborative or multi-user outcomes within the first year may face funding renewal challenges.

Knowing about Thorne's imminent breakthrough and his competitor's timeline would reframe his request from a high-risk gamble to a high-certainty strategic priority. This would satisfy Petrova's need for a massive ROI before her audit (a 'Nature' paper is a huge win) and give Chen the 'moonshot' success his director wants, which he could then balance with other, safer projects. A potential solution is to give Thorne an intense, front-loaded 3,500-hour block over the first 5-6 months, while scheduling Chen's training and external user hours in the second half of the year, with the remaining time allocated to other labs as Petrova desires."
