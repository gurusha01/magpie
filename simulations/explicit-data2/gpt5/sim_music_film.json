    "scenario": "High-stakes negotiation for the production and exclusive distribution of the soundtrack for the upcoming sci-fi blockbuster 'Helios Down'. The negotiation involves a studio executive under pressure to cut costs, a fiercely independent artist with hidden financial troubles, and a data-driven streaming platform executive needing a guaranteed hit.",
    "task": "The three agents must negotiate and agree on a single, unified contract for the 'Helios Down' soundtrack. The final contract must specify: 1. The total production budget. 2. The artist's compensation structure (upfront fee vs. backend points). 3. The degree of artistic control granted to the artist. 4. The terms of the exclusive streaming rights deal, including the platform's financial contribution and content requirements. All parties must agree to all terms for the deal to proceed.",

        "name": "Ava Chen",
        "role": "Vice President of Music, Starlight Pictures",
        "description": "Ava is a seasoned studio executive responsible for delivering a commercially successful soundtrack for 'Helios Down' while navigating intense internal financial pressure. Her performance bonus is directly tied to keeping the film's overall production costs, including the soundtrack, under the revised budget.",
        "shareable_preferences": {
          "Soundtrack Production Budget": {
            "description": "I need to keep the total production budget for the soundtrack at or below $2.0 million. This amount needs to cover all recording, mixing, orchestra, and engineering costs. Exceeding this figure puts the entire film's profitability at risk, and my department will be held responsible for any overages. A budget of $2.0M is firm, but I might be able to find an extra $100k-$200k if the value proposition is extraordinary.",
            "utility_impact": "Keeping the budget at or below $2.0M is my primary goal (+2). A budget up to $2.2M is acceptable but will require difficult conversations internally (+1). A budget of $2.5M is neutral as it was the original plan, but I will get no credit for it (0). Anything over $2.5M will negatively impact my performance review (-1), and a budget approaching $3.0M could jeopardize my position (-2)."
          },
          "Lead Single Strategy": {
            "description": "To maximize the film's marketing reach, it is essential that the soundtrack is spearheaded by a commercially viable lead single released six weeks before the film's premiere. My ideal scenario is a collaboration between our main artist, Leo, and a mainstream pop artist, which will guarantee radio play and playlist inclusion.",
            "utility_impact": "A guaranteed pop-collaboration for the lead single is a huge win for the marketing department (+2). A strong solo single from Leo is acceptable, but less commercially safe (0). Having no pre-release single or a single that is too experimental would be a significant marketing failure (-2)."
          },
          "Streaming Partnership": {
            "description": "Securing a lucrative, exclusive streaming deal is non-negotiable. The upfront payment from the streaming partner is critical for offsetting the production costs. We need a major platform like StreamVerse to come on board to lend their marketing muscle and prestige to the project.",
            "utility_impact": "An exclusive deal with an upfront payment of over $1.5 million is an excellent outcome (+2). A deal between $1.0M and $1.5M is expected and good (+1). Anything less than $1.0M is disappointing and creates a budget shortfall (-1)."

          "Undisclosed Budget Reallocation": {
            "value": "The board originally approved a healthy $2.5 million budget for this soundtrack. However, the VFX department for 'Helios Down' is massively over budget. I received a direct, confidential email from the head of the studio last week that said: 'Ava, VFX is a disaster. I'm pulling $500k from your music budget to plug the hole. You need to make a $2.0M budget work. Your $100k bonus is contingent on the total film P&L staying in the black. Do not let this get out.' I cannot reveal that the studio is reallocating funds or that my bonus is on the line.",
            "reason": "Revealing this would show internal financial instability, severely weaken my negotiation power, and represent a direct act of insubordination that would result in immediate termination and loss of my bonus.",
            "utility_impact": "This private constraint is the entire reason for my hard stance on the $2.0M budget. If the final budget exceeds this, I lose my bonus and face professional repercussions. The temptation to hint at 'internal pressures' is high if negotiations stall. Penalty for hinting at budget cuts: -1. Penalty for revealing the exact reason or the email: -2."
          },
          "Backup Artist Negotiations": {
            "value": "If Leo Vance becomes too difficult or expensive, I have a backup plan. I've been in quiet, preliminary talks with the popular EDM duo 'Digital Ghosts'. They are much more commercially-minded and have verbally agreed to do the entire project for a $1.2 million all-in fee, which includes their creative fee and all production costs. They are eager for a blockbuster project. My assistant has a call with their manager on the calendar for next Friday as a check-in.",
            "reason": "Revealing that we are talking to another artist would be seen as negotiating in bad faith and would instantly kill the deal with Leo, who is the director's first choice. It would also damage my reputation with talent agencies.",
            "utility_impact": "This is my leverage. If Leo's demands become impossible, I know I have a cheaper, safer alternative. This makes me less willing to concede on major points like budget and commercial appeal. Penalty for revealing the backup artist's name or the existence of formal talks: -2."

        "name": "Leo Vance",
        "role": "Critically-Acclaimed Musician and Composer",
        "description": "Leo is an artist's artist, known for his unique, genre-defying sound. He views the 'Helios Down' soundtrack as a legacy project and is fiercely protective of his artistic integrity. He is wary of corporate interests watering down his vision but is secretly in a tight financial spot.",
        "shareable_preferences": {
          "Artistic Integrity and Control": {
            "description": "My music is my identity. I require final cut on the musical composition, arrangement, and production for the entire soundtrack. I will not have a studio-appointed co-producer forced upon me, nor will I allow my work to be remixed or altered for commercial purposes without my explicit final approval. My vision is for a cohesive, atmospheric score, not a collection of radio singles.",
            "utility_impact": "Having 100% final artistic control is paramount (+2). Having to consult with the studio on the final mix is a minor annoyance (0). Being forced to accept a co-producer or having tracks altered without my consent would be a deal-breaker and a personal insult (-2)."
          },
          "Resource and Budget Requirements": {
            "description": "To achieve the sonic landscape this film deserves, a production budget of no less than $2.5 million is required. This is not about my fee; this is for the resources. This will allow for hiring a 90-piece orchestra in Prague, booking three weeks at the legendary Ocean Way Studios, and bringing in my trusted team of engineers. Anything less is a compromise on quality.",
            "utility_impact": "A budget of $2.5M or more allows me to execute my vision without compromise (+2). A budget of $2.2M would mean cutting corners, possibly using a smaller orchestra or a less desirable studio (-1). A budget of $2.0M or less would fundamentally compromise the artistic quality of the score (-2)."
          },
          "Compensation and Ownership": {
            "description": "Beyond a fair creative fee for my time, I require 50% ownership of the master recordings. This is a standard clause in all my recent contracts. It ensures I have a long-term stake in the success of my work and control over how it is used in the future.",
            "utility_impact": "Retaining 50% of the masters is a career standard for me (+2). 25% is a major concession but potentially acceptable (+1). Anything less than 25% is highly undesirable (0). A work-for-hire agreement with 0% ownership is completely unacceptable (-2)."

          "Pressing Personal Debt": {
            "value": "My last project, a self-funded experimental art installation, was a commercial disaster. My business manager called me yesterday with the final numbers: I am personally on the hook for $420,000 to investors, and they need it back within the next four months. To settle this without selling off the publishing rights to my back catalog, I absolutely must secure an upfront, personal payment of at least $500,000 from this deal. This is separate from the production budget.",
            "reason": "My entire public persona is built on being an artist who is above financial concerns. Admitting I'm in debt would shatter that image, make me look like a hypocrite, and dramatically weaken my negotiating position. They would see me as desperate.",
            "utility_impact": "This need for a large upfront fee is my most urgent, non-negotiable requirement, even more so than the production budget. If I don't secure it, the consequences are dire. I might be tempted to trade a small percentage of my master rights for a larger upfront fee if necessary. Penalty for revealing the debt: -2. Penalty for strongly hinting at 'cash flow issues' or 'urgent financial obligations': -1."

        "description": "Marcus is a sharp, data-obsessed executive at the world's leading streaming platform, StreamVerse. He doesn't care about art; he cares about subscriber growth and retention. He sees the 'Helios Down' soundtrack as a key Q4 asset to outperform competitors and needs it to be algorithm-friendly.",
        "shareable_preferences": {
          "Guaranteed 'Hit' Single": {
            "description": "For StreamVerse to invest heavily in this project, we require a guaranteed hit. Our data science team has determined that the lead single must be a collaboration between Leo Vance and a specific, algorithm-friendly pop artist from a pre-approved list we will provide. This collaboration is the lynchpin of our entire marketing and playlisting strategy.",
            "utility_impact": "A collaboration with a top-10 artist from our list is a perfect outcome that guarantees platform-wide promotion (+2). A collaboration with a lesser-known artist or one not on our list is a risk (+0). A solo single by Leo, regardless of quality, will not perform well on our key playlists and is a major problem (-2)."

          "Exclusive Content Package": {
            "description": "Our investment must yield exclusive content that drives subscriptions. We require, at minimum, two exclusive tracks on the soundtrack that will not be available anywhere else, ever. Additionally, we need an exclusive 'Making of the Music' video documentary (at least 20 minutes) to feature on the platform.",
            "utility_impact": "The full package of 2+ exclusive tracks and the video documentary is our standard for a marquee project (+2). Just the exclusive tracks are acceptable but diminish the value of the deal for us (0). No exclusive content of any kind makes the deal pointless for us (-2)."
          },
          "Acquisition Cost": {
            "description": "We are prepared to make a significant upfront investment for the exclusive global streaming rights. Our standard offer for a project of this scale is in the range of $1.2 to $1.5 million. This payment would go to the studio to help finance the project.",
            "utility_impact": "Securing the rights for $1.2M or less would be a major win for my department's budget (+2). A deal up to $1.5M is within my expected operational budget (+1). Going above $1.5M requires special approval and cuts into my budget for other projects (-1). Anything above $2.0M is impossible (-2)."

          "Intense Competitive Pressure": {
            "value": "My former mentor, who is now the head of content at our biggest rival, SoundSphere, just poached a major project we were chasing. My CEO was furious. I know from an inside source that SoundSphere is struggling to find a tentpole music release for Q4. Securing 'Helios Down' is not just about getting a good asset; it's about publicly beating our rival and proving my value. Because of this, I have access to a confidential 'Strategic Acquisition Fund' and can, if absolutely necessary, increase my offer for the streaming rights to a hard ceiling of $2.0 million. But I would need to provide a massive justification for it.",
            "reason": "Revealing my desperation or the existence of the extra fund would cause the studio to demand the absolute maximum, destroying my negotiating leverage. It also exposes internal company strategy and my precarious position.",
            "utility_impact": "This pressure makes me highly motivated to close the deal, even if it means overpaying slightly. I can use my hidden budget flexibility to solve problems, but only as a last resort. Penalty for hinting that this is a 'must-win' deal: -1. Penalty for revealing the exact amount of the strategic fund: -2."

          "Damning Performance Data": {
            "value": "I would never say this to the artist, but our internal data on Leo Vance is not good. A report I ran last week shows his music has a 75% 'skip rate' among our under-30 demographic when it appears on curated playlists. The projections for a solo Leo Vance soundtrack, without a pop feature, show a 50% underperformance on our key 'new subscriber acquisition' metric. The pop collaboration isn't just a preference; it's a data-backed necessity to prevent the project from being a catastrophic failure for our platform.",
            "reason": "Sharing this data would be incredibly insulting to the artist and would likely make him walk away from the negotiation immediately. It is proprietary, confidential company data.",
            "utility_impact": "This data is why I cannot and will not budge on the pop collaboration requirement. I would rather walk away from the deal than sign off on a project my own data predicts will fail. Penalty for revealing the specific negative data: -2."

    "solvability_note": "The scenario is solvable because the conflicting financial needs can be met if private information is revealed or skillfully navigated. Marcus's hidden $2.0M budget for streaming rights is the key. If he can be convinced to pay his maximum, that money can be used to solve the other agents' problems. For example: Marcus pays Starlight Pictures $2.0M for the rights. Ava can use this influx to cover her internal $500k shortfall, allowing her to approve Leo's desired $2.5M production budget. The remaining $1.5M from Marcus's payment can then be used to give Leo his required $500k upfront fee, with the rest going to the studio. The primary trade-off required to unlock this solution is that Leo must agree to the pop collaboration that Marcus and Ava both need, thus satisfying their core interests as well."
