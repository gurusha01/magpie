A committee of seven stakeholders must finalize the program's design and budget. Unbeknownst to most, the company is in the final stages of a secret merger ('Project Nightingale') with a larger competitor, which heavily influences the true needs of the program. The negotiation is fraught with hidden agendas, private career anxieties, and confidential corporate information.",

This involves agreeing on a definitive curriculum, selecting the external coaching vendor and package, finalizing the mentorship pairings, and allocating the total budget of $250,000 for the 6-month program. The final plan must be a single, cohesive proposal that all seven members can formally sign off on.",
