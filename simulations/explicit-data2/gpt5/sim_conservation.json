He can publicly state this goal as being for the 'national good'.",

This requires designating at least 50% of the total area (50,000 hectares) for conservation and research. This helps him manage his public image and satisfy environmental factions within the government.",
            "utility_impact": "+2 for >60% conservation zoning. +1 for 50-60%. 0 for 40-50%. -1 for <40%. This goal often conflicts directly with his revenue targets, creating his primary negotiation challenge."

The estimated raw value is over $200 million. Kaelan's strategy is to acquire the land under a cheap timber lease and then exploit the minerals. He recently received a congratulatory email from his board chair: 'Kaelan, fantastic work on the Serenity find. Secure that land for timber rights below $10M in fees and your $5M bonus is guaranteed.' Sharing the existence of minerals would skyrocket the land's value and invite competitors. Penalty for sharing existence of minerals: -1. Penalty for sharing the estimated value or his personal bonus: -2.",

This smaller footprint could be designed to avoid the specific locations of the sacred sites (from Elena) and the core leopard habitat (from Lena).
