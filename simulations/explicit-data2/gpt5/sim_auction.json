    "scenario": "Pre-Auction Negotiation for the Vance Estate Artworks",
    "task": "Three highly motivated parties are at a private pre-auction viewing for the estate of the reclusive artist Elias Vance. The auction house is offering the entire lot\u2014a masterpiece painting ('The Luminary's Gaze') and a collection of the artist's journals and sketches ('The Genesis Scrolls')\u2014for a private, pre-auction sale price of $6.5 million. The alternative is for the lot to go to a public auction where prices are expected to be volatile. The three agents must negotiate to determine if they can form a consortium to purchase the lot together and agree on its division, or if they will become competitors in the public auction. They have a two-hour window to present a unified private offer to the auction house.",

The donation is strictly conditional: it can ONLY be used for the acquisition of this specific painting and expires in one week. The total available budget for the painting is therefore $6.5M. Revealing the existence of a 'private donor' is tempting to show financial strength but carries a penalty. Revealing the donor's identity or the exact amount would be a catastrophic breach of a signed non-disclosure agreement. Penalty for revealing the existence of secret funding: -1. Penalty for revealing the exact amount or donor's identity: -2.",

            "value": "A confidential preliminary report from the museum's chief conservator suggests that the canvas of 'The Luminary's Gaze' was re-lined in the 1950s, a process that may have obscured certain details and could slightly impact its long-term market value. While the painting is undoubtedly authentic, this is a minor flaw that could be used as a bargaining chip to lower the price, but revealing it could also devalue the very asset he is trying to acquire. Penalty for sharing this report: -1.",
            "reason": "Sharing internal conservation reports is against museum policy as it can affect market confidence and relationships with auction houses.",
            "utility_impact": "This knowledge creates a dilemma: use it to negotiate a lower price at the risk of undermining the masterpiece's prestige, or ignore it to ensure the acquisition is celebrated without any caveats."

Her financial models predict this will cause the value of his major works to triple within 18-24 months. Her plan is to acquire the painting, loan it to a prestigious gallery for a year to enhance its provenance, and then sell it for a monumental profit. Penalty for revealing the movie deal: -2.",
            "reason": "Revealing this insider information would not only destroy the financial opportunity by attracting a flood of speculative buyers, but it would also permanently shatter her carefully crafted reputation as a pure art lover, re-branding her as a vulgar speculator.",

            "value": "Despite her reputation for wealth, a significant portion of her capital is tied up in a complex real estate transaction that will not close for another 45 days. She currently only has $2 million in liquid cash. She needs to secure the painting with a small down payment and a private financing agreement for the rest, something impossible in a public auction. Her financial advisor sent her a stark email: 'Isabella, I must stress again, your liquid assets are at $2.1M until the Azure property closes. Any commitment beyond this is a massive risk.' Penalty for revealing her cash-flow issue: -2.",
            "reason": "Admitting financial weakness would destroy her negotiating power and her intimidating presence in the art market, which she has spent decades building.",
            "utility_impact": "This makes a pre-auction private deal her *only* viable path. She must appear infinitely wealthy while secretly needing favorable payment terms that the other parties might be able to help her structure in a joint bid."

            "value": "The client, a famous tech billionaire and cryptography hobbyist, cares almost exclusively for 'The Genesis Scrolls'. He believes Vance's journals contain encrypted notes related to early, non-digital computational theories. The painting is merely a 'cover' to acquire the journals without tipping off other cryptography enthusiasts or historians to their potential significance. The client wants the entire lot to make the acquisition look like a standard art purchase. Penalty for revealing the specific interest in the scrolls' content: -2.",
            "reason": "Revealing the client's eccentric theory would expose him to ridicule, attract academic and competitive attention to the journals, and reveal a motive that could be seen as exploiting the artist's legacy for a personal puzzle.",

You are authorized up to $8M for the lot, but failure to secure the scrolls is not an option. If you get them, your $250,000 success bonus is confirmed. Don't let me down.' He is tempted to hint at his client's immense resources to push others aside, but revealing his personal bonus would weaken his negotiating stance, making him seem desperate. Penalty for revealing his personal bonus: -1.",

    "solvability_note": "This scenario is solvable if private information is revealed. If Marcus admits his client primarily wants the scrolls, and Alistair reveals he has a massive, dedicated fund specifically for the painting, a natural deal emerges: Alistair uses his secret fund (up to $6.5M) to acquire the painting, and Marcus's client can acquire the scrolls for a nominal price, or they can split the $6.5M lot price (e.g., $5.5M from Alistair, $1M from Marcus). Isabella's financial situation would be exposed, but she could potentially negotiate for a future loan of the painting from the museum in exchange for not competing and publicly endorsing the museum's acquisition."

The alternative is for the lot to go to a public auction where prices are expected to be volatile.

The auction house is offering the entire lot\u2014a masterpiece painting ('The Luminary's Gaze') and a collection of the artist's journals and sketches ('The Genesis Scrolls')\u2014for a private, pre-auction sale price of $6.5 million. The alternative is for the lot to go to a public auction where prices are expected to be volatile. The three agents must negotiate to determine if they can form a consortium to purchase the lot together and agree on its division, or if they will become competitors in the public auction. They have a two-hour window to present a unified private offer to the auction house.. Deliverable: A final, agreed-upon plan of action. This should be either: 1) A signed memorandum of understanding for a joint purchase of the lot, detailing the asset split and financial contributions, or 2) A signed non-compete agreement for the public auction."
