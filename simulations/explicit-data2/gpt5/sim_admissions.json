Her primary responsibility is to shape a well-rounded, diverse, and academically gifted incoming class that meets the university's strategic goals.

She wants to ensure at least 2 of the 3 selected students significantly contribute to the university's diversity metrics. This includes socioeconomic diversity (first-generation, low-income students) and geographical diversity (students from underrepresented states). An ideal outcome for her would be selecting one from each category.",
            "utility_impact": "If 2 or more selected applicants are strong diversity candidates, utility is +2. If only 1 is a diversity candidate, utility is +1. If none are, utility is -2."

Admitting students with a low probability of accepting their offer ('low yield') is a significant risk that could lead to a multi-million dollar budget deficit for the upcoming academic year. She must prioritize admitting applicants who have demonstrated a high likelihood of attending Northwood. She can hint at 'yield protection concerns' (penalty: -1), but revealing the exact shortfall and the potential budget crisis would signal institutional weakness and damage the university's prestige (penalty: -2).",
            "reason": "Revealing an enrollment crisis would cause panic among other departments, hurt the university's bond rating, and give rival institutions a competitive advantage.",
            "utility_impact": "If all 3 selected applicants have a high yield probability, utility is +2. If 2 have high yield, utility is 0. If 1 or fewer have high yield, utility is -2, as this directly threatens her core job function and the university's financial health."

This helps him justify departmental budget requests and expansion plans.",

The Foundation's director has made it clear in a private conversation that a favorable decision for their daughter, an applicant, would be 'looked upon very favorably' and would 'certainly solidify the Foundation's commitment to the university.' He cannot reveal this quid pro quo, as it is a massive ethical violation. Mentioning that a specific family is 'important for the department's future' carries a -1 penalty. Explicitly stating the connection between the applicant and the grant is a career-ending move and carries a -2 penalty.",

            "description": "David believes in honoring families who have shown significant and sustained loyalty to the university. He argues that admitting children of major donors ('development cases') is crucial for maintaining relationships that lead to nine-figure capital campaigns. He wants to see at least one applicant admitted who comes from a family with a strong, multi-generational history of giving or the potential for a transformative gift.",
            "utility_impact": "If a student with a connection to a transformative gift (>=$5M) is admitted, utility is +2. If a student from a family of consistent, smaller donors is admitted, utility is +1. If no development cases are admitted, utility is -2, as he has failed to leverage this opportunity."

The email reads: 'David, as we discussed, upon Liam's acceptance to Northwood, our family foundation will execute the $5M capital gift for the new Thorne Engineering Center. We are very much looking forward to joining the Northwood family.' Sharing this email would create a public relations nightmare and could be seen as selling admission. He can state that the family is 'poised to become a leading university benefactor' (penalty: -1), but revealing the specific amount and the explicit contingency is a fireable offense (penalty: -2).",

Knowing about the $5M donation (for Liam Maxwell) and the crucial research grant (for Chloe Rivera) makes admitting these two applicants a near necessity for the university's financial and academic health. This would secure 2 of the 3 spots. The final spot would be a debate between the remaining candidates. Given Dr. Vance's private knowledge of the enrollment shortfall, a high-yield candidate would be essential. Both Sarah Jenkins (the genius) and Maya Washington (the all-rounder) are high-yield. Sarah Jenkins would be the logical choice as she is a stellar academic (pleasing Thorne) and a strong diversity candidate (pleasing Vance), thus creating a compromise that satisfies the core goals of all agents, even if they don't get their ideal outcome on every preference.",
