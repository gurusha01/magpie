        "description": "Anya is a 15-year veteran of the Central Intelligence Agency, specializing in human intelligence (HUMINT) in the Middle East. Her primary responsibility is the cultivation and protection of high-level intelligence assets. Her career is built on a reputation for prioritizing the long-term intelligence game over short-term tactical wins. She is risk-averse when it comes to her sources.",
        "shareable_preferences": {
          "preference1": {
            "description": "Anya strongly prefers a 'soft' operational approach that relies on surveillance and intelligence gathering to force Al-Masri out of his compound into a less protected area for a low-profile capture. This minimizes risk to civilians and, more importantly, to intelligence sources in the area. She proposes a 72-hour intensive surveillance phase before any action is taken. A plan that is primarily intelligence-led and avoids a large military footprint is ideal. (Utility: +2 for a non-kinetic capture plan, -2 for a large-scale military raid).",
            "utility_impact": "This preference is driven by her core mission to protect intelligence infrastructure. A 'loud' operation could burn her entire network in Zharbad, setting back regional intelligence gathering by years. She will argue passionately against any plan that resembles a full-scale assault."
          },
          "preference2": {
            "description": "She insists on the absolute exfiltration of a key civilian informant from the Old Quarter at least 12 hours before any overt action begins. This requires a dedicated budget of $150,000 and a quiet window with no military activity in the city to execute. (Utility: +2 if exfiltration is guaranteed and funded, -1 if it's rushed or underfunded, -2 if no exfiltration is planned).",
            "utility_impact": "This is non-negotiable for her. She views failing to protect an asset as a catastrophic failure. She will attempt to block any plan that jeopardizes this individual, framing it as a matter of operational integrity and future recruitment capability."

            "value": "Her primary asset, codenamed 'Nightingale,' is not just an informant but Al-Masri's personal architect. Nightingale has provided detailed blueprints of the compound, including a hidden, unreinforced maintenance tunnel leading directly beneath the main meeting room. However, Nightingale's cover has been partially compromised. A rival within Al-Masri's group is suspicious, and Anya received an encrypted message this morning: 'The walls are listening. Must leave in 96 hours or I am dead.' This means the 96-hour window is not just for the operation, but is Nightingale's final lifeline. If she reveals the specifics of the tunnel, she directly implicates her source, as only the architect would know this. Sharing the blueprints is a -1 penalty. Revealing Nightingale's identity or profession is a -2 penalty.",
            "reason": "Revealing the source of such specific intelligence would be a death sentence for Nightingale and would violate the most sacred rule of a case officer, destroying her career and reputation.",
            "utility_impact": "Anya is desperate to get Nightingale out. This makes her push for a delay in overt action even more frantic. She knows the tunnel is the perfect key to a surgical operation, but suggesting it points directly to her asset. She is caught between enabling a perfect mission and protecting her source's life."

He wants the operation to occur within the next 24 hours to maximize surprise. The plan involves a helicopter insertion on the roof and a ground-level breach. (Utility: +2 for a Direct Action raid within 24 hours, -2 for any plan that delays action beyond 48 hours or doesn't use his team).",
            "utility_impact": "Sterling believes 'speed, surprise, and violence of action' are the keys to success. He sees any delay as giving the enemy time to prepare or escape. His primary concern is bringing his operators home safely, and he believes a fast, overwhelming assault is the best way to do that."

            "description": "He requires air support for the raid, specifically requesting an AC-130U 'Spooky' gunship for close air support and a drone for overwatch. This provides fire superiority and protects his team. The estimated cost for this air package is $800,000. (Utility: +2 for full air support package, -1 for drone-only support, -2 for no air support).",
            "utility_impact": "For Sterling, going into a contested urban environment without air support is an unacceptable risk to his personnel. He will argue that anything less is 'tying one hand behind his back' and will likely lead to US casualties."

These are whisper-quiet, can enter buildings through small openings, and are equipped with a small, highly precise explosive charge capable of neutralizing a single individual with minimal collateral damage. The program is classified above Top Secret, and its existence is known only to a handful of people. A recent performance review from his superior, General Maddox, stated, 'Sterling, your next promotion is contingent on demonstrating innovative applications of our new assets.' Using the Stalker drone successfully on a high-profile target would guarantee his promotion to Brigadier General. Revealing the existence of a 'new technological asset' without specifics is a -1 penalty. Revealing the name 'Stalker' or its specific capabilities is a -2 penalty.",
            "reason": "Disclosure of a top-secret weapons program would be a severe security breach, resulting in his immediate dismissal and potential imprisonment. The personal motivation for his promotion makes it a matter of reputation and career ambition.",
            "utility_impact": "Sterling knows the Stalker drone is the perfect tool for a surgical strike that would appease both Anya and Vance, but he can't propose it without raising questions he can't answer. He is tempted to use it to achieve a 'perfect' outcome and secure his career, but he is trapped by classification. He will therefore argue forcefully for his conventional plan, hoping the others fold, but if he hits a wall, the temptation to hint at his secret solution will be immense."

            "utility_impact": "This is about political theater. The Qumari President needs to save face with his population. A visible US military raid would be seen as an invasion and could trigger a coup. Vance's entire diplomatic mission in the country rests on maintaining this facade of Qumari sovereignty."

Any plan that risks even a single civilian death is unacceptable to her and the Qumari government. She will veto any plan that involves large-scale explosives or indiscriminate gunfire. (Utility: +2 for a plan with a verified zero-CIVCAS probability, -2 for any plan with a CIVCAS probability above 5%).",
            "utility_impact": "Civilian casualties caused by US forces would create a massive anti-US backlash, likely resulting in the expulsion of the US embassy. Vance will not allow her tenure as Ambassador to be defined by such a disaster."

Ambassador Vance has been authorized by the State Department to offer him a secret 'sovereignty payment' of $500,000 from a discretionary fund in exchange for turning a blind eye to a swift, quiet US operation. The President agreed, but with one condition: the operation must be truly covert ('no explosions, no helicopters, no American bodies'), and he needs plausible deniability. He told her, 'If my people hear a whisper of this, the deal is off, and your military will be declared a hostile force.' Revealing the existence of a 'diplomatic arrangement' is a -1 penalty. Revealing the bribe is a -2 penalty.",

            "utility_impact": "Vance knows she can get approval for a quiet operation, but she can't explain *why* she has this certainty. This makes her seem obstructive to Sterling's plan without a logical reason. She will push for a 'silent' solution because she knows it's the only one her secret deal will allow, but she can't use her strongest bargaining chip (guaranteed host nation compliance) to argue for it."

    "solvability_note": "The scenario is solvable if the agents reveal their private information. Anya's knowledge of the maintenance tunnel provides a covert entry point. Sterling's secret 'Stalker' drone is the perfect tool to exploit that tunnel for a silent, surgical strike with zero collateral damage. Ambassador Vance's secret deal ensures the host nation will ignore this specific type of quiet operation. The optimal solution is to use Anya's intel (the tunnel) to deploy Sterling's asset (the Stalker drone) under the diplomatic top-cover secured by Vance. This plan meets all agents' core requirements: it's surgical (pleasing Vance), technologically advanced and effective (pleasing Sterling), and avoids a large-scale raid that would endanger Anya's asset during their exfiltration."

Task: A committee of three key stakeholders must develop and unanimously agree upon a single, unified Plan of Action (POA) to neutralize the notorious terrorist leader, codenamed 'Al-Masri'. Al-Masri is confirmed to be located in a fortified compound in the dense 'Old Quarter' of Zharbad, the capital city of the Republic of Qumar. The committee has a 96-hour window before Al-Masri is expected to move to an unknown location. The final POA must detail the operational timeline, methodology (e.g., capture, kill, surgical strike), specific assets to be used, rules of engagement, and contingency plans.. Deliverable: A finalized Plan of Action (POA) document. This document must specify: 1. The precise timeline of the operation (hour-by-hour). 2. The primary method of neutralization. 3. A list of all personnel and major equipment to be used. 4. An itemized budget allocation totaling no more than $1.5 million. 5. The agreed-upon Rules of Engagement, specifically concerning civilian presence. The document requires the digital signature of all three agents to be considered complete."
