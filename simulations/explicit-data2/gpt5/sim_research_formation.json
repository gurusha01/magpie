    "scenario": "Formation of an International Rapid Response Team to address the 'Aethel-24' viral outbreak in the neutral Republic of Kasia. The negotiation involves a public health organization, a major military power, and a private multinational corporation, each with its own agenda, resource limitations, and sensitive information.",
    "task": "The three agents must negotiate and unanimously agree on the final terms of the 'Aethel-24 Joint Response Mandate'. This mandate is a formal document that must explicitly define five key operational parameters: Team Leadership, Budget Allocation, Team Composition, Primary Operational Priority, and Mission Timeline. Failure to reach a unanimous agreement on all five points will result in a catastrophic delay, allowing the pandemic to spread unchecked.",

His primary motivation is the swift and effective containment of the Aethel-24 virus based on scientific principles. He is under immense pressure, as the GHC's reputation was tarnished by a perceived slow response to the last global health crisis.",

            "description": "The team must be led by a world-class virologist. My nominee, Dr. Lena Hanson, has unparalleled experience with hemorrhagic fevers. Her leadership is non-negotiable for ensuring the mission's scientific integrity and avoiding politically-motivated decisions that could compromise public health. A military or corporate leader would be unacceptable.",
            "utility_impact": "Utility: +2 if Dr. Hanson is appointed Team Leader; -2 if a non-scientist is appointed; 0 otherwise. Her leadership ensures we prioritize saving lives over politics or profit, which is my core mission."

          "Rapid Deployment": {
            "description": "We must be on the ground and operational within 4 days. Every 24-hour delay allows the virus to spread exponentially. I am advocating for an aggressive 8-week mission duration to quickly establish the virus's parameters, implement containment, and exit. A longer mission risks team fatigue and increased exposure.",
            "utility_impact": "Utility: +2 for deployment within 4 days and an 8-week mission; +1 for deployment within 7 days; -1 for deployment taking longer than 10 days. Speed is everything in a new outbreak."

          "Team Composition (Scientific Focus)": {
            "description": "To effectively understand and fight this virus, the team's composition must be heavily weighted towards scientific and medical expertise. I propose a 50-person team composed of at least 25 virologists, epidemiologists, and field medics. Security and logistics are support roles and should not constitute the majority of the team.",
            "utility_impact": "Utility: +2 if scientific/medical staff is >= 25; +1 if it is between 20-24; -2 if it is less than 20. We need brains, not just guards or truck drivers."

            "description": "All epidemiological data, genomic sequences, and clinical findings collected by the team must be immediately shared on an open-source platform accessible to the global scientific community. Transparency is crucial for rapid vaccine and treatment development worldwide. Any restriction on data sharing is a threat to global health.",
            "utility_impact": "Utility: +2 for a fully open-data policy; -2 for any policy that restricts or delays data sharing to the global community. Secrecy kills."

This means it's far more contagious than anyone else in this room knows. This information is unverified and releasing it would cause global panic and discredit the GHC if wrong. I can only say the situation is 'more urgent than current estimates suggest.' Leaking that the data is 'significantly worse' carries a -1 penalty. Leaking the specific number '4.5' is a catastrophic -3 penalty.",
            "reason": "Releasing unverified, panic-inducing data would be a massive breach of scientific protocol and could destroy the GHC's credibility, making future international cooperation impossible.",
            "utility_impact": "This secret knowledge is why I am so adamant about rapid deployment and scientific leadership. The world has no idea how fast this is spreading, and any delays are potentially costing thousands of lives."

            "value": "The Global Health Coalition is facing a severe budget crisis. Our maximum possible contribution to this mission is $10 million. If I reveal this, the GHC will be seen as a weak and ineffective partner, jeopardizing our entire operational budget for the next fiscal year. I must publicly project financial strength and can only state that 'the GHC is prepared to make a substantial contribution.' Revealing we have a hard limit is a -2 penalty. Revealing the specific number ($10M) is a -3 penalty.",
            "reason": "Admitting financial weakness would undermine my negotiating position and the perceived authority of the GHC on the world stage, potentially leading to our organization being sidelined in future crises.",
            "utility_impact": "This forces me to push for other parties to cover the bulk of the costs while I try to secure the operational control I need. I must trade financial contribution for decision-making power."

His leadership will ensure disciplined, secure operations that protect our people from both the virus and regional threats.",

            "description": "A hasty deployment is a dangerous one. We need a minimum of 14 days to pre-deploy security assets, establish a secure base of operations, and vet local contacts. I propose a mission duration of the full 12 weeks allowed by the Kasian government to ensure we can conduct a thorough, methodical, and secure operation without rushing.",
            "utility_impact": "Utility: +2 for deployment in >= 14 days and a 12-week mission; -1 for deployment in < 7 days. Rushing in blind is how you get people killed."

            "description": "The 50-person team must have a robust security contingent. I require a minimum of 20 highly-trained security personnel from my country to guarantee the team's physical safety. These are not mere guards; they are specialists in hazardous environment operations. This is a non-negotiable security minimum.",
            "utility_impact": "Utility: +2 if security staff is >= 20; +1 if it is 15-19; -2 if it is less than 15. The mission is irrelevant if the team is compromised."

          "Centralized Data Control": {
            "description": "To prevent misinformation and protect sensitive operational details, all data and communications must be routed through a single, secure channel managed by the team's security chief. Data can be released to the public in vetted daily briefings, but a live, open feed is a security nightmare and an invitation for espionage.",

The facility is disguised as a meteorological station. If the response team operates in this 'Northern Exclusion Zone,' they could inadvertently discover it, creating a major international incident. I have a map with a 50km radius circle where my government has forbidden all mission activity. I cannot reveal the existence of the facility; I can only state that 'the northern region is geopolitically unstable and off-limits for security reasons.' Revealing that there is a specific 'asset' to protect is a -2 penalty. Revealing its nature as an intelligence facility is a catastrophic -4 penalty.",
            "reason": "Disclosure of a covert intelligence facility on foreign soil is a grave breach of national security and would cause a severe diplomatic crisis with Kasia and other world powers.",
            "utility_impact": "My entire strategy revolves around this. I need a security lead and a large security force to control the team's movements and enforce the 'no-go' zone. I must block any operational plan that involves extensive contact tracing or investigation in that specific northern direction."

          "Budgetary Leverage": {
            "value": "My government sees this crisis as an opportunity to gain influence in the region. They have authorized me to contribute up to $70 million to the mission budget, but ONLY if we secure the Team Leader or Security Chief position and maintain control over the team's movements. I am instructed to start with a low offer (e.g., $20M) and use the additional funds as a bargaining chip. I cannot reveal my maximum budget, as it would remove all my leverage. Revealing that my budget is 'highly flexible' is a -1 penalty. Revealing the $70M figure is a -3 penalty.",
            "reason": "This is a matter of state negotiation strategy. Revealing your full hand at the start is a sign of weakness and poor diplomacy.",

          "Logistics & Operations Leadership": {
            "description": "The biggest challenge in any pandemic response is logistics. Getting the right gear and people to the right place is what determines success. A scientist or a soldier doesn't understand supply chains. I propose a co-leadership structure, with a scientific lead and an operational lead. My nominee for Ops Lead, a logistics genius named Maria Flores, would ensure the mission runs efficiently.",
            "utility_impact": "Utility: +2 if my nominee is Ops Lead or co-leader; -1 if logistics are managed by a non-specialist; 0 otherwise. A great plan is useless if you can't execute it."

            "description": "Containment is impossible without knowing the scale of the problem. The team's first and primary priority must be the immediate deployment of a mass testing and diagnostics program. We need to test as many people as possible to understand the virus's spread. This is more important than strict quarantines initially.",
            "utility_impact": "Utility: +2 if 'Mass Testing' is the agreed Primary Priority; -1 if 'Quarantine/Contact Tracing' is the priority. We need data first, and testing is how we get it."

I propose that at least 15 of the 50 team members be dedicated logistics and support staff. My company, OmniHealth, can provide these highly-skilled individuals.",
            "utility_impact": "Utility: +2 if logistics/support staff is >= 15; -1 if it is less than 10. Without our logistics people, the scientists and soldiers will be sitting in the dark without equipment."

My board has mandated that our participation is contingent on securing a minimum procurement contract of $30 million for 5 million test kits. I have a confidential email from my CEO that reads, in part: 'Liam, make this happen and the $450K profit projection for your division guarantees you that Director-level promotion and the accompanying $100k bonus. Don't fail.' I can share that we have a 'promising diagnostic tool' but cannot reveal the contractual nature or the minimum price. Sharing that a contract is required is a -1 penalty. Sharing the specific dollar amount ($30M) is a -2 penalty. Mentioning my promotion or bonus is a catastrophic -4 penalty.",

            "value": "While I am pushing for a large logistics team, my company can only mobilize a maximum of 20 people (a mix of logisticians and medics) for this specific mission due to other commitments. If the team demands more than 20 personnel from OmniHealth, I cannot deliver, and the deal will fall through. I must avoid this topic or frame it as 'our ideal contribution is a team of 15-20 specialists.' Revealing we have a hard cap of 20 is a -2 penalty.",

For example, Rostova's need for control can be met by giving her appointee Security Chief status (not overall Leader) and agreeing to avoid her 'unstable' northern zone. In exchange, she can use her large, hidden budget ($70M) to fund the majority of the mission. This large budget can cover Chen's required $30M test kit contract, satisfying him and making 'Mass Testing' the priority. Dr. Thorne gets his scientific leader, a rapid deployment timeline funded by others, and can contribute his modest $10M without losing face. A balanced team of 20 scientists, 15 security, and 15 logisticians would satisfy everyone's minimum requirements and fit the 50-person limit."
