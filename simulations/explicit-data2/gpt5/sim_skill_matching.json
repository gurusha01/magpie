The initial attack has caused sporadic power outages and water pressure fluctuations, but intelligence suggests this is a precursor to a much larger, physically destructive event. A rapid, multi-disciplinary response team must be formed immediately to analyze the threat, mitigate its impact, and prevent catastrophe.",
    "task": "The four agents must negotiate and agree on the formation, structure, and operational parameters of a new Joint Crisis Response Team (JCRT). They need to finalize a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) that explicitly defines: the team's leadership structure, the total operating budget for the initial 90-day response phase, the primary technical approach and tools to be used, and the protocol for information sharing and public disclosure.",

A private entity leading a national crisis response is unprecedented and introduces unacceptable risks. (+2 for NCDC sole leadership, -1 for co-leadership, -2 for private sector leadership)",
            "utility_impact": "This preference is paramount for Anya. Losing control of the response would not only be a personal and professional failure but, in her view, would set a dangerous precedent for national security.
