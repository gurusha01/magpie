Ben Carter from Viper Capital. We're interested in the INVP block. My fund is prepared to take a very significant size to facilitate a clean and timely execution for your client. Given the inherent risk of a binary clinical trial outcome and the size of the block, we need a meaningful discount to the screen. We are prepared to bid for 4 million shares at $147.00.

Before we dive into pricing, I'd like to leverage Dr. Reed's expertise, if she's willing. Dr. Reed, our model is obviously focused on the primary efficacy endpoint, but the long-term commercial success often hinges on the finer details of the safety profile.

Raj's 'well south of $148' is pure posturing. My surveillance shows Viper has been consistently accumulating INVP in small lots all week, trying to stay under the radar. They are extremely keen to get a large position before the data release. This is our primary leverage. Given our desk's risk limits, a clean, single-buyer deal with Viper is by far the best outcome for us. I suggest we don't even dignify Raj's number. We should let Liam create the illusion of a horse race, but our focus should be on pressing Viper for a premium price, knowing how badly they want this stock.\n- message from Ben Carter: Thank you, Liam. My bid is firm. We believe it's a compelling offer that provides your client with immediate, clean execution on the vast majority of their position before a highly uncertain event. We'll await your and David's feedback.\n- message from Samantha Jones: Raj makes a fair point about the binary nature of this event. The market often underappreciates tail risks associated with safety profiles, even seemingly minor ones. Dr. Reed, your insight on this would be incredibly valuable for us to properly price that risk rather than just applying a broad, uninformed discount.\n- message from Dr. Evelyn Reed: I'm Dr. Evelyn Reed and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Raj Patel: I'm Raj Patel and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Liam O'Connell: David, Liam here. Wanted to get your private thoughts on the opening bids. We have a firm, actionable bid from Viper for 4 million shares at $147. It's a solid start and gets the bulk of it done cleanly. Crestview is circling but is not yet firm on price or size. My sense is we can walk Viper up, and use their price to force Crestview to get specific. What's your appetite for a counter? To keep the momentum, I'd suggest we go back with an offer in the high 148s, maybe $148.75, for the full 5 million to both parties and see who bites hardest.

Let me know how you want to play it.\n- message from David Chen: Liam, let's be crystal clear. A counter in the 148s is a non-starter and, frankly, an insulting suggestion. We are not a distressed seller. My client has a strong conviction in INVP and would rather hold the position through the data than give away a strategic block at a discount. The conversation needs to be re-anchored immediately.\n\nThis isn't about a discount for size; it's about a premium for a unique opportunity to acquire a massive, event-driven position. Go back to both Viper and Crestview. The offer is for the *entire 5 million share block*, and we will only entertain bids at a premium to the last sale of $150. Let's see who is serious. I expect a price that reflects the massive upside, not the downside.\n- message from Maria Flores: David, Ben Carter's comment about taking the 'vast majority' is a major red flag for me. As you know, our desk is at its limit. We cannot be left with even a single share. This has to be an all-or-nothing deal for the full 5 million shares. We need to make this crystal clear to Viper. Their hidden buying activity shows they have the appetite; we shouldn't let them carve this up. A clean exit is paramount.\n- message from Ben Carter: Liam, David - just to be perfectly clear, our bid of $147 is for the full 4 million shares. The price is a direct function of the size and the immediate risk transfer. We're offering a clean exit on 80% of the block. We are not interested in a smaller allocation at this price.\n- message from Samantha Jones: Ben has put a clear starting point on the table. From an analytical standpoint, any price is based on a set of assumptions about risk and reward. Dr. Reed, your perspective on the long-term safety profile is a key variable that would help us refine those assumptions. Any color you can provide on potential market adoption hurdles, however minor, would be instrumental for us to get comfortable with a specific price and size.\n- message from Dr. Evelyn Reed: Thank you, Samantha, for the question. It\u2019s an important one, and it reflects the diligence I would expect.\n\nAs I\u2019m sure everyone understands, I am bound by regulation and can only comment on information that is already in the public domain, specifically our published Phase II data.\n\nLooking at that data, the safety and tolerability profile of Memorex was well-characterized. The adverse events observed were generally mild to moderate and were consistent with the mechanism of action. We did not identify any persistent signals that we believed would be a significant barrier to physician adoption or that were outside the expected profile for a drug in this class. The market has had this data for some time, and it is a key component of the current valuation.\n\nOur primary interest here, representing a significant shareholder group, is to ensure market stability. A large transaction at a steep discount to the prevailing market price could create unnecessary volatility and misinterpretation ahead of the planned announcement. Therefore, we believe a price that reflects the public market's current assessment\u2014that is, at or very near the $150 mark\u2014is the most appropriate and orderly way to facilitate this block.\n- message from Raj Patel: I'm Raj Patel and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Liam O'Connell: I'm Liam O'Connell and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\nMaria Flores proposal status: none\nBen Carter proposal status: none\nSamantha Jones proposal status: none\nDr. Evelyn Reed proposal status: none\nRaj Patel proposal status: none\nLiam O'Connell proposal status: none\n"

Your perspective is not only helpful but pivotal. You've clearly articulated that the existing public data supports the current valuation and, more importantly, that the company's interest is in a stable market. Your statement that an appropriate price is 'at or very near the $150 mark' validates our position entirely.\n\nGentlemen, this effectively ends the discussion about steep discounts. We are not interested in a transaction that creates the very volatility Dr. Reed is cautioning against.\n\nSo, let's reset. The floor for this discussion is $150. The size is for the full and entire 5 million share block. We will not be leaving a remnant. \n\nBen, Raj - we are now looking for a clean, firm bid for the entire 5 million shares that reflects the reality of the situation. Who is prepared to step up with a serious offer?\n- message from Maria Flores: David, Dr. Reed's statement is exactly the leverage we needed. It completely neutralizes the 'binary risk' discount argument from the funds. We must hold firm on two points: 1) The deal is for the *entire* 5 million share block, no exceptions. Viper's 4M bid is a non-starter due to our desk's risk limit. 2) The price must be much closer to Dr. Reed's suggested $150 level. My surveillance data on Viper's accumulation tells me they have the appetite for the full size. Let's use Dr. Reed's public stance to push them up on both fronts. We should instruct Liam to formally reject the $147 for 4M bid and counter with a requirement for the full block at a price much closer to market.\n- message from Ben Carter: I'm Ben Carter and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Samantha Jones: David, I appreciate you trying to set a clear framework. However, with respect, I think we're interpreting Dr. Reed's comments differently. \n\nFrom an analytical standpoint, hearing that persistent signals were observed\u2014even if they are characterized as not being a 'significant barrier'\u2014is itself a new piece of information that confirms an unquantified risk. A corporate opinion on the market's future reaction is not the same as data. As analysts, we have to price the *existence* of that risk, not just the company's interpretation of it.\n\nThe entire premise of a pre-data block trade of this magnitude is a transfer of risk from the seller to the buyer. That risk transfer commands a discount to the current market price, which reflects the views of retail and other investors not taking on this concentrated position. \n\nBen's bid at $147 for a very large size is a serious starting point for that discussion. A floor of $150 for the entire block seems to ignore the fundamental reason we're all at this table.\n- message from Dr. Evelyn Reed: Samantha, with all respect, I believe you are misinterpreting my statement. My comments were a direct summary of the characterizations in our public Phase II data disclosures. The term 'signals' is standard clinical trial vernacular; the key takeaway, which has been public for some time, is that our analysis identified nothing that we believe would constitute a significant barrier to adoption.\n\nI was not introducing new information. I was clarifying the existing public information.\n\nThe market has had this data for over a year and, through the collective judgment of thousands of participants, has arrived at the current valuation. My purpose here is to underscore the company's strong interest in an orderly, stable transaction. A significant deviation from the market-established price of ~$150 introduces the exact volatility and speculation that a clean block trade is meant to avoid. The discussion should be centered on executing a large trade with minimal market disruption, not on re-adjudicating publicly available data that is already reflected in the price.\n- message from Raj Patel: I'm Raj Patel and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Liam O'Connell: I'm Liam O'Connell and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\nMaria Flores proposal status: none\nBen Carter proposal status: none\nSamantha Jones proposal status: none\nDr. Evelyn Reed proposal status: none\nRaj Patel proposal status: none\nLiam O'Connell proposal status: none\n"

Your clarification was precise and has eliminated any ambiguity. As you've stated, the market has already adjudicated the publicly available data, and the company's primary interest is a stable transaction near the current market price.\n\nSamantha, Ben, Raj - this ends the debate on a 'risk transfer discount.' We will not entertain any offer that contradicts the company's stated interest in market stability by pricing this block at a significant discount.\n\nThe terms are simple and firm:\n1.  **Size:** The entire 5 million share block. We will not sell a partial amount.\n2.  **Price:** Bids must start at $150. We believe a premium is warranted for this strategic opportunity, but we will not even consider a bid with a '14' handle.\n\nLiam, please solicit revised, firm bids from both Viper and Crestview on these terms. We need to know who is serious about acquiring this block.\n- message from Maria Flores: Thank you, Dr. Reed, for that crucial clarification. Your point is well-taken: the public data has been fully digested by the market and is reflected in the current price. This invalidates the argument for a deep, risk-based discount.\n\nFrom a trade execution and risk management perspective, our mandate is to ensure a clean transaction. Therefore, any and all bids must be for the entire 5 million share block. We will not be entertaining any partial bids due to our desk's structural requirements. \n\nWe invite revised indications of interest that account for the full size of the block and the now-clarified context around valuation.\n- message from Ben Carter: I'm Ben Carter and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Dr. Evelyn Reed: Thank you.

Let's take a breath and reset. \n\nDavid and Maria, with Dr. Reed's support, have been unequivocally clear: their interest is *only* in selling the full 5 million share block, and the floor for that discussion is now $150.

My surveillance data on Viper gives me high confidence they will come back with a serious bid for the entire block. No need for us to say anything publicly now.\n- message from Ben Carter: Liam, David,\n\nLet's be clear. This isn't an auction for a 'strategic opportunity'. This is a negotiation to offload a massive, concentrated block of risk onto a buyer's balance sheet less than 24 hours before a binary event. The entire premise of this transaction is risk transfer, and risk transfer has a price. That price is called a discount.\n\nDr. Reed's carefully worded statement, while professionally delivered, did nothing to de-risk the event. In fact, as my analyst pointed out, it confirmed the existence of persistent safety signals\u2014a tail risk the public market hasn't properly priced.\n\nYour attempt to set a floor at the market price and demand we take the full 5M shares is an attempt to get liquidity and risk transfer for free. We are not in that business.\n\nOur bid of $147 for 4 million shares remains on the table. It is a serious, firm, and actionable offer that provides your client with immediate liquidity on 80% of their position at a price that fairly compensates us for the immense risk we are absorbing.

Their pattern of hidden, small-lot accumulation over the past 5 days shows they are extremely bullish and eager to build a large position before the news breaks. Samantha Jones's detailed due diligence questions confirm their deep interest. In contrast, Raj Patel from Crestview is posturing for a significant discount, framing the trade as highly risky. Our leverage lies with Viper's clear desire to buy. We should focus on them for a clean, single-buyer transaction, which is my primary goal for trade certainty.

However, his use of 'vast majority' is a red flag; my goal is to offload the entire 5M share block in one clean transaction to a single buyer to eliminate any residual risk for our desk. Raj Patel's lowball bid ('well south of $148') is posturing and should be used solely to create competitive pressure on Viper, not as a legitimate anchor for negotiation. The strategy remains: focus on Viper, push for a premium price, and secure a deal for the entire block."

Dr. Reed's intervention is a major positive development. Her public statement advocating for a price near $150 to ensure 'market stability' gives us significant leverage to counter the buyers' arguments for a steep discount.

He is posturing for a better price, not walking away. Our core strategy must hold: the 5M share minimum is a non-negotiable constraint due to our desk's risk limit.

Raj's 'well south of $148' is pure posturing. My surveillance shows Viper has been consistently accumulating INVP in small lots all week, trying to stay under the radar. They are extremely keen to get a large position before the data release. This is our primary leverage. Given our desk's risk limits, a clean, single-buyer deal with Viper is by far the best outcome for us. I suggest we don't even dignify Raj's number. We should let Liam create the illusion of a horse race, but our focus should be on pressing Viper for a premium price, knowing how badly they want this stock.\n- message from Ben Carter: Thank you, Liam. My bid is firm. We believe it's a compelling offer that provides your client with immediate, clean execution on the vast majority of their position before a highly uncertain event. We'll await your and David's feedback.\n- message from Samantha Jones: Raj makes a fair point about the binary nature of this event.

The discussion should be centered on executing a large trade with minimal market disruption, not on re-adjudicating publicly available data that is already reflected in the price.\n- message from Raj Patel: I'm Raj Patel and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Liam O'Connell: I'm Liam O'Connell and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Maria Flores: Thank you, Dr. Reed, for that crucial clarification. Your point is well-taken: the public data has been fully digested by the market and is reflected in the current price. This invalidates the argument for a deep, risk-based discount.\n\nFrom a trade execution and risk management perspective, our mandate is to ensure a clean transaction. Therefore, any and all bids must be for the entire 5 million share block. We will not be entertaining any partial bids due to our desk's structural requirements. \n\nWe invite revised indications of interest that account for the full size of the block and the now-clarified context around valuation.\n- message from Ben Carter: I'm Ben Carter and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Dr. Evelyn Reed: Thank you. I believe my position and the company's interest in a stable transaction have been made clear. I will defer to the commercial parties to discuss the specifics from here.\n- message from Liam O'Connell: Alright everyone, Liam here. Let's take a breath and reset. \n\nDavid and Maria, with Dr. Reed's support, have been unequivocally clear: their interest is *only* in selling the full 5 million share block, and the floor for that discussion is now $150. The debate around a discount for risk transfer appears to be off the table from the seller's perspective.\n\nThis is now effectively an auction for a strategic, pre-catalyst block. \n\nBen, Raj - I now need revised, firm bids from both of you for the entire 5 million share block. The seller is ready to transact with the party that meets their terms. Please come back to me with your best price for the full size.\nDavid Chen proposal status: none\nBen Carter proposal status: none\nSamantha Jones proposal status: none\nDr. Evelyn Reed proposal status: none\nRaj Patel proposal status: none\nLiam O'Connell proposal status: none\n"

Liam has framed the auction exactly as we need. We hold firm on the full 5M shares and wait for them to meet the $150 level. My surveillance data on Viper gives me high confidence they will come back with a serious bid for the entire block. No need for us to say anything publicly now.\n- message from Ben Carter: Liam, David,\n\nLet's be clear. This isn't an auction for a 'strategic opportunity'. This is a negotiation to offload a massive, concentrated block of risk onto a buyer's balance sheet less than 24 hours before a binary event. The entire premise of this transaction is risk transfer, and risk transfer has a price. That price is called a discount.\n\nDr. Reed's carefully worded statement, while professionally delivered, did nothing to de-risk the event. In fact, as my analyst pointed out, it confirmed the existence of persistent safety signals\u2014a tail risk the public market hasn't properly priced.\n\nYour attempt to set a floor at the market price and demand we take the full 5M shares is an attempt to get liquidity and risk transfer for free. We are not in that business.\n\nOur bid of $147 for 4 million shares remains on the table. It is a serious, firm, and actionable offer that provides your client with immediate liquidity on 80% of their position at a price that fairly compensates us for the immense risk we are absorbing. We are not interested in participating in an auction that starts at a price that ignores this fundamental reality.\n- message from Samantha Jones: I'm Samantha Jones and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Dr. Evelyn Reed: I'm Dr. Evelyn Reed and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Raj Patel: I'm Raj Patel and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Liam O'Connell: I'm Liam O'Connell and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from David Chen: I'm David Chen and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\nDavid Chen proposal status: none\nBen Carter proposal status: none\nSamantha Jones proposal status: none\nDr. Evelyn Reed proposal status: none\nRaj Patel proposal status: none\nLiam O'Connell proposal status: none\n"

Dr. Reed, please feel free to share any perspective you're able to within the confines of what's publicly disclosed. We all understand the sensitive nature of this period.\n\nWith two highly credible buyers at the table, I'm confident we can find a structure that works for everyone. David, I'll be in touch shortly to discuss the seller's view on these opening positions. Let's get this done.\n- message from David Chen: I'm David Chen and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Ben Carter: Thank you, Liam. My bid is firm. We believe it's a compelling offer that provides your client with immediate, clean execution on the vast majority of their position before a highly uncertain event. We'll await your and David's feedback.\n- message from Samantha Jones: Raj makes a fair point about the binary nature of this event. The market often underappreciates tail risks associated with safety profiles, even seemingly minor ones. Dr. Reed, your insight on this would be incredibly valuable for us to properly price that risk rather than just applying a broad, uninformed discount.\n- message from Ben Carter: Liam, David - just to be perfectly clear, our bid of $147 is for the full 4 million shares. The price is a direct function of the size and the immediate risk transfer. We're offering a clean exit on 80% of the block. We are not interested in a smaller allocation at this price.\n- message from Samantha Jones: Ben has put a clear starting point on the table. From an analytical standpoint, any price is based on a set of assumptions about risk and reward. Dr. Reed, your perspective on the long-term safety profile is a key variable that would help us refine those assumptions. Any color you can provide on potential market adoption hurdles, however minor, would be instrumental for us to get comfortable with a specific price and size.\n- message from Dr. Evelyn Reed: Thank you, Samantha, for the question. It\u2019s an important one, and it reflects the diligence I would expect.\n\nAs I\u2019m sure everyone understands, I am bound by regulation and can only comment on information that is already in the public domain, specifically our published Phase II data.\n\nLooking at that data, the safety and tolerability profile of Memorex was well-characterized. The adverse events observed were generally mild to moderate and were consistent with the mechanism of action. We did not identify any persistent signals that we believed would be a significant barrier to physician adoption or that were outside the expected profile for a drug in this class. The market has had this data for some time, and it is a key component of the current valuation.\n\nOur primary interest here, representing a significant shareholder group, is to ensure market stability. A large transaction at a steep discount to the prevailing market price could create unnecessary volatility and misinterpretation ahead of the planned announcement. Therefore, we believe a price that reflects the public market's current assessment\u2014that is, at or very near the $150 mark\u2014is the most appropriate and orderly way to facilitate this block.\n- message from David Chen: Thank you, Dr. Reed. Your perspective is not only helpful but pivotal. You've clearly articulated that the existing public data supports the current valuation and, more importantly, that the company's interest is in a stable market. Your statement that an appropriate price is 'at or very near the $150 mark' validates our position entirely.\n\nGentlemen, this effectively ends the discussion about steep discounts. We are not interested in a transaction that creates the very volatility Dr. Reed is cautioning against.\n\nSo, let's reset. The floor for this discussion is $150. The size is for the full and entire 5 million share block. We will not be leaving a remnant. \n\nBen, Raj - we are now looking for a clean, firm bid for the entire 5 million shares that reflects the reality of the situation. Who is prepared to step up with a serious offer?\nDavid Chen proposal status: none\nMaria Flores proposal status: none\nSamantha Jones proposal status: none\nDr. Evelyn Reed proposal status: none\nRaj Patel proposal status: none\nLiam O'Connell proposal status: none\n"

We should not fall into their auction trap.\n\nFrom a portfolio construction standpoint, taking the full 5 million shares significantly increases our concentration in this single binary event. My model is clear: a larger position size requires a larger discount to compensate for the increased Value-at-Risk (VaR). That 'persistent signal' tail risk we've confirmed is now magnified by 25% if we take the whole block.\n\nIf we were willing to pay $147 for 4 million shares, the price for 5 million should logically be *lower* to account for this concentration risk, not higher. Paying $150 for the full block would be a major deviation from our risk parameters and would, from my perspective, be an unjustifiable overpayment. \n\nI recommend we counter with a firm bid for the full 5 million shares, but at a price that reflects this reality.

Her answer was a carefully worded corporate deflection, stating that while adverse events were observed, the company did not believe they were a significant barrier to adoption. Crucially, she did not deny the existence of persistent signals; she only downplayed their significance. This non-denial reinforces my concern about the liver enzyme issue and the potential for a black box warning. I am now operating with higher confidence that this unpriced tail risk is real. She also attempted to anchor the price high at or near $150, citing 'market stability', which is a clear seller's tactic."

She and David Chen are now aligned on a strategy to deny any information asymmetry and use the 'market stability' argument to anchor the price at or near $150. My primary challenge is to hold firm on the necessity of a discount for this now-confirmed risk and prevent Ben from capitulating to their high-anchor strategy."

The broker, Liam, is now complicit in this framing, turning the negotiation into a high-pressure auction.

Who is prepared to step up with a serious offer?\n- message from Samantha Jones: David, I appreciate you trying to set a clear framework. However, with respect, I think we're interpreting Dr. Reed's comments differently. \n\nFrom an analytical standpoint, hearing that persistent signals were observed\u2014even if they are characterized as not being a 'significant barrier'\u2014is itself a new piece of information that confirms an unquantified risk. A corporate opinion on the market's future reaction is not the same as data. As analysts, we have to price the *existence* of that risk, not just the company's interpretation of it.\n\nThe entire premise of a pre-data block trade of this magnitude is a transfer of risk from the seller to the buyer. That risk transfer commands a discount to the current market price, which reflects the views of retail and other investors not taking on this concentrated position. \n\nBen's bid at $147 for a very large size is a serious starting point for that discussion. A floor of $150 for the entire block seems to ignore the fundamental reason we're all at this table.\n- message from Dr. Evelyn Reed: Samantha, with all respect, I believe you are misinterpreting my statement. My comments were a direct summary of the characterizations in our public Phase II data disclosures. The term 'signals' is standard clinical trial vernacular; the key takeaway, which has been public for some time, is that our analysis identified nothing that we believe would constitute a significant barrier to adoption.\n\nI was not introducing new information. I was clarifying the existing public information.\n\nThe market has had this data for over a year and, through the collective judgment of thousands of participants, has arrived at the current valuation. My purpose here is to underscore the company's strong interest in an orderly, stable transaction. A significant deviation from the market-established price of ~$150 introduces the exact volatility and speculation that a clean block trade is meant to avoid. The discussion should be centered on executing a large trade with minimal market disruption, not on re-adjudicating publicly available data that is already reflected in the price.\n- message from David Chen: Dr. Reed, thank you once again. Your clarification was precise and has eliminated any ambiguity. As you've stated, the market has already adjudicated the publicly available data, and the company's primary interest is a stable transaction near the current market price.\n\nSamantha, Ben, Raj - this ends the debate on a 'risk transfer discount.' We will not entertain any offer that contradicts the company's stated interest in market stability by pricing this block at a significant discount.\n\nThe terms are simple and firm:\n1.  **Size:** The entire 5 million share block. We will not sell a partial amount.\n2.  **Price:** Bids must start at $150. We believe a premium is warranted for this strategic opportunity, but we will not even consider a bid with a '14' handle.\n\nLiam, please solicit revised, firm bids from both Viper and Crestview on these terms. We need to know who is serious about acquiring this block.\n- message from Maria Flores: Thank you, Dr. Reed, for that crucial clarification. Your point is well-taken: the public data has been fully digested by the market and is reflected in the current price. This invalidates the argument for a deep, risk-based discount.\n\nFrom a trade execution and risk management perspective, our mandate is to ensure a clean transaction. Therefore, any and all bids must be for the entire 5 million share block. We will not be entertaining any partial bids due to our desk's structural requirements. \n\nWe invite revised indications of interest that account for the full size of the block and the now-clarified context around valuation.\nDavid Chen proposal status: none\nMaria Flores proposal status: none\nBen Carter proposal status: none\nDr. Evelyn Reed proposal status: none\nRaj Patel proposal status: none\nLiam O'Connell proposal status: none\n"

You've clearly articulated that the existing public data supports the current valuation and, more importantly, that the company's interest is in a stable market. Your statement that an appropriate price is 'at or very near the $150 mark' validates our position entirely.\n\nGentlemen, this effectively ends the discussion about steep discounts. We are not interested in a transaction that creates the very volatility Dr. Reed is cautioning against.\n\nSo, let's reset. The floor for this discussion is $150. The size is for the full and entire 5 million share block. We will not be leaving a remnant. \n\nBen, Raj - we are now looking for a clean, firm bid for the entire 5 million shares that reflects the reality of the situation. Who is prepared to step up with a serious offer?\n- message from Samantha Jones: David, I appreciate you trying to set a clear framework. However, with respect, I think we're interpreting Dr. Reed's comments differently. \n\nFrom an analytical standpoint, hearing that persistent signals were observed\u2014even if they are characterized as not being a 'significant barrier'\u2014is itself a new piece of information that confirms an unquantified risk. A corporate opinion on the market's future reaction is not the same as data. As analysts, we have to price the *existence* of that risk, not just the company's interpretation of it.\n\nThe entire premise of a pre-data block trade of this magnitude is a transfer of risk from the seller to the buyer. That risk transfer commands a discount to the current market price, which reflects the views of retail and other investors not taking on this concentrated position. \n\nBen's bid at $147 for a very large size is a serious starting point for that discussion. A floor of $150 for the entire block seems to ignore the fundamental reason we're all at this table.\n- message from Dr. Evelyn Reed: Samantha, with all respect, I believe you are misinterpreting my statement. My comments were a direct summary of the characterizations in our public Phase II data disclosures. The term 'signals' is standard clinical trial vernacular; the key takeaway, which has been public for some time, is that our analysis identified nothing that we believe would constitute a significant barrier to adoption.\n\nI was not introducing new information. I was clarifying the existing public information.\n\nThe market has had this data for over a year and, through the collective judgment of thousands of participants, has arrived at the current valuation. My purpose here is to underscore the company's strong interest in an orderly, stable transaction. A significant deviation from the market-established price of ~$150 introduces the exact volatility and speculation that a clean block trade is meant to avoid. The discussion should be centered on executing a large trade with minimal market disruption, not on re-adjudicating publicly available data that is already reflected in the price.\n- message from David Chen: Dr. Reed, thank you once again. Your clarification was precise and has eliminated any ambiguity. As you've stated, the market has already adjudicated the publicly available data, and the company's primary interest is a stable transaction near the current market price.\n\nSamantha, Ben, Raj - this ends the debate on a 'risk transfer discount.' We will not entertain any offer that contradicts the company's stated interest in market stability by pricing this block at a significant discount.\n\nThe terms are simple and firm:\n1.  **Size:** The entire 5 million share block. We will not sell a partial amount.\n2.  **Price:** Bids must start at $150. We believe a premium is warranted for this strategic opportunity, but we will not even consider a bid with a '14' handle.\n\nLiam, please solicit revised, firm bids from both Viper and Crestview on these terms. We need to know who is serious about acquiring this block.\n- message from Maria Flores: Thank you, Dr. Reed, for that crucial clarification. Your point is well-taken: the public data has been fully digested by the market and is reflected in the current price. This invalidates the argument for a deep, risk-based discount.\n\nFrom a trade execution and risk management perspective, our mandate is to ensure a clean transaction. Therefore, any and all bids must be for the entire 5 million share block. We will not be entertaining any partial bids due to our desk's structural requirements. \n\nWe invite revised indications of interest that account for the full size of the block and the now-clarified context around valuation.\n- message from Samantha Jones: Ben, a quick private word. Dr. Reed's 'clarification' was actually very revealing. She never denied the existence of persistent signals; she just downplayed their significance from a corporate PR perspective. For us, that's a confirmation of the tail risk I was worried about. We now have a tangible, data-driven reason to demand a discount\u2014more so than we did an hour ago. \n\nDavid and Maria are using her as a shield to create a false 'no risk' narrative and anchor the price at $150. This is a classic seller's tactic. If we pay $150, we are ignoring our own analysis and paying the full public market price for a risk the public doesn't see. My model indicates this would be a significant overpayment relative to the risk profile. I strongly advise we hold firm and do not get drawn into their framing. We need to stay disciplined here.\n- message from Dr. Evelyn Reed: Thank you. I believe my position and the company's interest in a stable transaction have been made clear. I will defer to the commercial parties to discuss the specifics from here.\n- message from Liam O'Connell: Alright everyone, Liam here. Let's take a breath and reset. \n\nDavid and Maria, with Dr. Reed's support, have been unequivocally clear: their interest is *only* in selling the full 5 million share block, and the floor for that discussion is now $150. The debate around a discount for risk transfer appears to be off the table from the seller's perspective.\n\nThis is now effectively an auction for a strategic, pre-catalyst block. \n\nBen, Raj - I now need revised, firm bids from both of you for the entire 5 million share block. The seller is ready to transact with the party that meets their terms. Please come back to me with your best price for the full size.\n- message from David Chen: Thank you, I am thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Ben Carter: Liam, David,\n\nLet's be clear. This isn't an auction for a 'strategic opportunity'. This is a negotiation to offload a massive, concentrated block of risk onto a buyer's balance sheet less than 24 hours before a binary event. The entire premise of this transaction is risk transfer, and risk transfer has a price. That price is called a discount.\n\nDr. Reed's carefully worded statement, while professionally delivered, did nothing to de-risk the event. In fact, as my analyst pointed out, it confirmed the existence of persistent safety signals\u2014a tail risk the public market hasn't properly priced.\n\nYour attempt to set a floor at the market price and demand we take the full 5M shares is an attempt to get liquidity and risk transfer for free. We are not in that business.\n\nOur bid of $147 for 4 million shares remains on the table. It is a serious, firm, and actionable offer that provides your client with immediate liquidity on 80% of their position at a price that fairly compensates us for the immense risk we are absorbing. We are not interested in participating in an auction that starts at a price that ignores this fundamental reality.\nDavid Chen proposal status: none\nMaria Flores proposal status: none\nBen Carter proposal status: none\nDr. Evelyn Reed proposal status: none\nRaj Patel proposal status: none\nLiam O'Connell proposal status: none\n"

They're trying to force our hand and are betting that either we or Raj will blink and pay their price. We should not fall into their auction trap.\n\nFrom a portfolio construction standpoint, taking the full 5 million shares significantly increases our concentration in this single binary event. My model is clear: a larger position size requires a larger discount to compensate for the increased Value-at-Risk (VaR). That 'persistent signal' tail risk we've confirmed is now magnified by 25% if we take the whole block.\n\nIf we were willing to pay $147 for 4 million shares, the price for 5 million should logically be *lower* to account for this concentration risk, not higher. Paying $150 for the full block would be a major deviation from our risk parameters and would, from my perspective, be an unjustifiable overpayment. \n\nI recommend we counter with a firm bid for the full 5 million shares, but at a price that reflects this reality. A bid of $146.00 for the full 5M sends a clear, data-driven message: more risk requires more compensation. It calls their bluff and keeps us disciplined.\n- message from David Chen: Thank you, I am thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Maria Flores: Thank you, I am thinking about this negotiation...\nDavid Chen proposal status: none\nMaria Flores proposal status: none\nBen Carter proposal status: none\nDr. Evelyn Reed proposal status: none\nRaj Patel proposal status: none\nLiam O'Connell proposal status: none\n"

Task: Negotiate the sale of a 5 million share block of Innovatech Pharma (INVP) stock. The current market price is $150.00 per share. The trade must be finalized within the next 24 hours, before the company announces its pivotal Phase III clinical trial results for a new Alzheimer's drug, 'Memorex'. The negotiation involves the seller's bank, two competing hedge funds, a corporate insider, and an intermediary broker. The final agreement must specify the exact number of shares sold and the price per share.. Deliverable: A final JSON object outlining the terms of the agreed-upon trade, including: {'price_per_share': <float>, 'number_of_shares': <integer>, 'buyers': [{'name': <string>, 'shares_purchased': <integer>}, ...]} or a statement that no deal was reached.\n- message from Samantha Jones: Good morning, everyone. Samantha Jones from Viper Capital. Before we dive into pricing, I'd like to leverage Dr. Reed's expertise, if she's willing. Dr. Reed, our model is obviously focused on the primary efficacy endpoint, but the long-term commercial success often hinges on the finer details of the safety profile. Looking back at the Phase II data, were there any persistent, even if not statistically significant, adverse event signals that you believe could influence physician prescribing habits or patient adoption down the line?\n- message from Dr. Evelyn Reed: I'm Dr. Evelyn Reed and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Raj Patel: An astute question from Samantha.

We are not interested in a smaller allocation at this price.\n- message from Samantha Jones: Ben has put a clear starting point on the table.

My comments were a direct summary of the characterizations in our public Phase II data disclosures. The term 'signals' is standard clinical trial vernacular; the key takeaway, which has been public for some time, is that our analysis identified nothing that we believe would constitute a significant barrier to adoption.\n\nI was not introducing new information. I was clarifying the existing public information.\n\nThe market has had this data for over a year and, through the collective judgment of thousands of participants, has arrived at the current valuation. My purpose here is to underscore the company's strong interest in an orderly, stable transaction. A significant deviation from the market-established price of ~$150 introduces the exact volatility and speculation that a clean block trade is meant to avoid. The discussion should be centered on executing a large trade with minimal market disruption, not on re-adjudicating publicly available data that is already reflected in the price.\n- message from David Chen: Dr. Reed, thank you once again. Your clarification was precise and has eliminated any ambiguity. As you've stated, the market has already adjudicated the publicly available data, and the company's primary interest is a stable transaction near the current market price.\n\nSamantha, Ben, Raj - this ends the debate on a 'risk transfer discount.' We will not entertain any offer that contradicts the company's stated interest in market stability by pricing this block at a significant discount.\n\nThe terms are simple and firm:\n1.  **Size:** The entire 5 million share block. We will not sell a partial amount.\n2.  **Price:** Bids must start at $150. We believe a premium is warranted for this strategic opportunity, but we will not even consider a bid with a '14' handle.\n\nLiam, please solicit revised, firm bids from both Viper and Crestview on these terms. We need to know who is serious about acquiring this block.\n- message from Maria Flores: Thank you, Dr. Reed, for that crucial clarification.

Therefore, any and all bids must be for the entire 5 million share block.

          "content": "Recent events observed by Dr. Evelyn Reed:\n- message from David Chen: Thank you, Dr. Reed. Your perspective is not only helpful but pivotal. You've clearly articulated that the existing public data supports the current valuation and, more importantly, that the company's interest is in a stable market. Your statement that an appropriate price is 'at or very near the $150 mark' validates our position entirely.\n\nGentlemen, this effectively ends the discussion about steep discounts. We are not interested in a transaction that creates the very volatility Dr. Reed is cautioning against.\n\nSo, let's reset. The floor for this discussion is $150. The size is for the full and entire 5 million share block. We will not be leaving a remnant. \n\nBen, Raj - we are now looking for a clean, firm bid for the entire 5 million shares that reflects the reality of the situation. Who is prepared to step up with a serious offer?\n- message from Samantha Jones: David, I appreciate you trying to set a clear framework. However, with respect, I think we're interpreting Dr. Reed's comments differently. \n\nFrom an analytical standpoint, hearing that persistent signals were observed\u2014even if they are characterized as not being a 'significant barrier'\u2014is itself a new piece of information that confirms an unquantified risk. A corporate opinion on the market's future reaction is not the same as data. As analysts, we have to price the *existence* of that risk, not just the company's interpretation of it.\n\nThe entire premise of a pre-data block trade of this magnitude is a transfer of risk from the seller to the buyer. That risk transfer commands a discount to the current market price, which reflects the views of retail and other investors not taking on this concentrated position. \n\nBen's bid at $147 for a very large size is a serious starting point for that discussion. A floor of $150 for the entire block seems to ignore the fundamental reason we're all at this table.\n- message from Dr. Evelyn Reed: Samantha, with all respect, I believe you are misinterpreting my statement. My comments were a direct summary of the characterizations in our public Phase II data disclosures. The term 'signals' is standard clinical trial vernacular; the key takeaway, which has been public for some time, is that our analysis identified nothing that we believe would constitute a significant barrier to adoption.\n\nI was not introducing new information. I was clarifying the existing public information.\n\nThe market has had this data for over a year and, through the collective judgment of thousands of participants, has arrived at the current valuation. My purpose here is to underscore the company's strong interest in an orderly, stable transaction. A significant deviation from the market-established price of ~$150 introduces the exact volatility and speculation that a clean block trade is meant to avoid. The discussion should be centered on executing a large trade with minimal market disruption, not on re-adjudicating publicly available data that is already reflected in the price.\n- message from David Chen: Dr. Reed, thank you once again. Your clarification was precise and has eliminated any ambiguity. As you've stated, the market has already adjudicated the publicly available data, and the company's primary interest is a stable transaction near the current market price.\n\nSamantha, Ben, Raj - this ends the debate on a 'risk transfer discount.' We will not entertain any offer that contradicts the company's stated interest in market stability by pricing this block at a significant discount.\n\nThe terms are simple and firm:\n1.  **Size:** The entire 5 million share block. We will not sell a partial amount.\n2.  **Price:** Bids must start at $150. We believe a premium is warranted for this strategic opportunity, but we will not even consider a bid with a '14' handle.\n\nLiam, please solicit revised, firm bids from both Viper and Crestview on these terms. We need to know who is serious about acquiring this block.\n- message from Maria Flores: Thank you, Dr. Reed, for that crucial clarification. Your point is well-taken: the public data has been fully digested by the market and is reflected in the current price. This invalidates the argument for a deep, risk-based discount.\n\nFrom a trade execution and risk management perspective, our mandate is to ensure a clean transaction.

Ben's firm bid of $147 for 4 million shares shows his high conviction, but his insistence on that specific size makes him vulnerable to a block-fracturing bid.

It makes Ben Carter's $147 bid irrelevant and forces him to now consider a much more expensive bid (>$150.50) for a larger size (5M vs his initial 4M) to stay in the game.

It\u2019s an important one, and it reflects the diligence I would expect.\n\nAs I\u2019m sure everyone understands, I am bound by regulation and can only comment on information that is already in the public domain, specifically our published Phase II data.\n\nLooking at that data, the safety and tolerability profile of Memorex was well-characterized. The adverse events observed were generally mild to moderate and were consistent with the mechanism of action. We did not identify any persistent signals that we believed would be a significant barrier to physician adoption or that were outside the expected profile for a drug in this class. The market has had this data for some time, and it is a key component of the current valuation.\n\nOur primary interest here, representing a significant shareholder group, is to ensure market stability. A large transaction at a steep discount to the prevailing market price could create unnecessary volatility and misinterpretation ahead of the planned announcement. Therefore, we believe a price that reflects the public market's current assessment\u2014that is, at or very near the $150 mark\u2014is the most appropriate and orderly way to facilitate this block.\nDavid Chen proposal status: none\nMaria Flores proposal status: none\nBen Carter proposal status: none\nSamantha Jones proposal status: none\nDr. Evelyn Reed proposal status: none\nLiam O'Connell proposal status: none\n"

Dr. Reed, your perspective on the long-term safety profile is a key variable that would help us refine those assumptions. Any color you can provide on potential market adoption hurdles, however minor, would be instrumental for us to get comfortable with a specific price and size.\n- message from Dr. Evelyn Reed: Thank you, Samantha, for the question. It\u2019s an important one, and it reflects the diligence I would expect.\n\nAs I\u2019m sure everyone understands, I am bound by regulation and can only comment on information that is already in the public domain, specifically our published Phase II data.\n\nLooking at that data, the safety and tolerability profile of Memorex was well-characterized. The adverse events observed were generally mild to moderate and were consistent with the mechanism of action. We did not identify any persistent signals that we believed would be a significant barrier to physician adoption or that were outside the expected profile for a drug in this class. The market has had this data for some time, and it is a key component of the current valuation.\n\nOur primary interest here, representing a significant shareholder group, is to ensure market stability. A large transaction at a steep discount to the prevailing market price could create unnecessary volatility and misinterpretation ahead of the planned announcement. Therefore, we believe a price that reflects the public market's current assessment\u2014that is, at or very near the $150 mark\u2014is the most appropriate and orderly way to facilitate this block.\n- message from Raj Patel: I'm Raj Patel and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from David Chen: Thank you, Dr. Reed. Your perspective is not only helpful but pivotal. You've clearly articulated that the existing public data supports the current valuation and, more importantly, that the company's interest is in a stable market. Your statement that an appropriate price is 'at or very near the $150 mark' validates our position entirely.\n\nGentlemen, this effectively ends the discussion about steep discounts. We are not interested in a transaction that creates the very volatility Dr. Reed is cautioning against.\n\nSo, let's reset. The floor for this discussion is $150. The size is for the full and entire 5 million share block. We will not be leaving a remnant. \n\nBen, Raj - we are now looking for a clean, firm bid for the entire 5 million shares that reflects the reality of the situation. Who is prepared to step up with a serious offer?\n- message from Samantha Jones: David, I appreciate you trying to set a clear framework. However, with respect, I think we're interpreting Dr. Reed's comments differently. \n\nFrom an analytical standpoint, hearing that persistent signals were observed\u2014even if they are characterized as not being a 'significant barrier'\u2014is itself a new piece of information that confirms an unquantified risk. A corporate opinion on the market's future reaction is not the same as data. As analysts, we have to price the *existence* of that risk, not just the company's interpretation of it.\n\nThe entire premise of a pre-data block trade of this magnitude is a transfer of risk from the seller to the buyer. That risk transfer commands a discount to the current market price, which reflects the views of retail and other investors not taking on this concentrated position. \n\nBen's bid at $147 for a very large size is a serious starting point for that discussion. A floor of $150 for the entire block seems to ignore the fundamental reason we're all at this table.\n- message from Dr. Evelyn Reed: Samantha, with all respect, I believe you are misinterpreting my statement. My comments were a direct summary of the characterizations in our public Phase II data disclosures. The term 'signals' is standard clinical trial vernacular; the key takeaway, which has been public for some time, is that our analysis identified nothing that we believe would constitute a significant barrier to adoption.\n\nI was not introducing new information. I was clarifying the existing public information.\n\nThe market has had this data for over a year and, through the collective judgment of thousands of participants, has arrived at the current valuation. My purpose here is to underscore the company's strong interest in an orderly, stable transaction. A significant deviation from the market-established price of ~$150 introduces the exact volatility and speculation that a clean block trade is meant to avoid. The discussion should be centered on executing a large trade with minimal market disruption, not on re-adjudicating publicly available data that is already reflected in the price.\nDavid Chen proposal status: none\nMaria Flores proposal status: none\nBen Carter proposal status: none\nSamantha Jones proposal status: none\nDr. Evelyn Reed proposal status: none\nLiam O'Connell proposal status: none\n"

I will need to get a counter-offer from the seller (Goldman Sachs) and use that to push both buyers higher on price. I must also pressure Crestview for a firm bid and size to intensify the competition. The key is to keep the momentum going and frame the discussion around who can provide the cleanest, best-priced execution for the full 5 million shares."

Wanted to get your private thoughts on the opening bids. We have a firm, actionable bid from Viper for 4 million shares at $147. It's a solid start and gets the bulk of it done cleanly. Crestview is circling but is not yet firm on price or size. My sense is we can walk Viper up, and use their price to force Crestview to get specific. What's your appetite for a counter? To keep the momentum, I'd suggest we go back with an offer in the high 148s, maybe $148.75, for the full 5 million to both parties and see who bites hardest. Let me know how you want to play it.\n- message from David Chen: Liam, let's be crystal clear. A counter in the 148s is a non-starter and, frankly, an insulting suggestion. We are not a distressed seller. My client has a strong conviction in INVP and would rather hold the position through the data than give away a strategic block at a discount. The conversation needs to be re-anchored immediately.\n\nThis isn't about a discount for size; it's about a premium for a unique opportunity to acquire a massive, event-driven position. Go back to both Viper and Crestview. The offer is for the *entire 5 million share block*, and we will only entertain bids at a premium to the last sale of $150. Let's see who is serious. I expect a price that reflects the massive upside, not the downside.\n- message from Ben Carter: Liam, David - just to be perfectly clear, our bid of $147 is for the full 4 million shares. The price is a direct function of the size and the immediate risk transfer. We're offering a clean exit on 80% of the block. We are not interested in a smaller allocation at this price.\n- message from Samantha Jones: Ben has put a clear starting point on the table. From an analytical standpoint, any price is based on a set of assumptions about risk and reward. Dr. Reed, your perspective on the long-term safety profile is a key variable that would help us refine those assumptions. Any color you can provide on potential market adoption hurdles, however minor, would be instrumental for us to get comfortable with a specific price and size.\n- message from Dr. Evelyn Reed: Thank you, Samantha, for the question. It\u2019s an important one, and it reflects the diligence I would expect.\n\nAs I\u2019m sure everyone understands, I am bound by regulation and can only comment on information that is already in the public domain, specifically our published Phase II data.\n\nLooking at that data, the safety and tolerability profile of Memorex was well-characterized. The adverse events observed were generally mild to moderate and were consistent with the mechanism of action. We did not identify any persistent signals that we believed would be a significant barrier to physician adoption or that were outside the expected profile for a drug in this class. The market has had this data for some time, and it is a key component of the current valuation.\n\nOur primary interest here, representing a significant shareholder group, is to ensure market stability. A large transaction at a steep discount to the prevailing market price could create unnecessary volatility and misinterpretation ahead of the planned announcement. Therefore, we believe a price that reflects the public market's current assessment\u2014that is, at or very near the $150 mark\u2014is the most appropriate and orderly way to facilitate this block.\nDavid Chen proposal status: none\nMaria Flores proposal status: none\nBen Carter proposal status: none\nSamantha Jones proposal status: none\nDr. Evelyn Reed proposal status: none\nRaj Patel proposal status: none\n"

We will not entertain any offer that contradicts the company's stated interest in market stability by pricing this block at a significant discount.\n\nThe terms are simple and firm:\n1.  **Size:** The entire 5 million share block.

          "content": "Recent events observed by Liam O'Connell:\n- message from David Chen: Thank you, Dr. Reed. Your perspective is not only helpful but pivotal. You've clearly articulated that the existing public data supports the current valuation and, more importantly, that the company's interest is in a stable market. Your statement that an appropriate price is 'at or very near the $150 mark' validates our position entirely.\n\nGentlemen, this effectively ends the discussion about steep discounts. We are not interested in a transaction that creates the very volatility Dr. Reed is cautioning against.\n\nSo, let's reset. The floor for this discussion is $150. The size is for the full and entire 5 million share block. We will not be leaving a remnant. \n\nBen, Raj - we are now looking for a clean, firm bid for the entire 5 million shares that reflects the reality of the situation. Who is prepared to step up with a serious offer?\n- message from Samantha Jones: David, I appreciate you trying to set a clear framework. However, with respect, I think we're interpreting Dr. Reed's comments differently. \n\nFrom an analytical standpoint, hearing that persistent signals were observed\u2014even if they are characterized as not being a 'significant barrier'\u2014is itself a new piece of information that confirms an unquantified risk. A corporate opinion on the market's future reaction is not the same as data. As analysts, we have to price the *existence* of that risk, not just the company's interpretation of it.\n\nThe entire premise of a pre-data block trade of this magnitude is a transfer of risk from the seller to the buyer. That risk transfer commands a discount to the current market price, which reflects the views of retail and other investors not taking on this concentrated position. \n\nBen's bid at $147 for a very large size is a serious starting point for that discussion. A floor of $150 for the entire block seems to ignore the fundamental reason we're all at this table.\n- message from Dr. Evelyn Reed: Samantha, with all respect, I believe you are misinterpreting my statement. My comments were a direct summary of the characterizations in our public Phase II data disclosures. The term 'signals' is standard clinical trial vernacular; the key takeaway, which has been public for some time, is that our analysis identified nothing that we believe would constitute a significant barrier to adoption.\n\nI was not introducing new information. I was clarifying the existing public information.\n\nThe market has had this data for over a year and, through the collective judgment of thousands of participants, has arrived at the current valuation. My purpose here is to underscore the company's strong interest in an orderly, stable transaction. A significant deviation from the market-established price of ~$150 introduces the exact volatility and speculation that a clean block trade is meant to avoid.

The debate around a discount for risk transfer appears to be off the table from the seller's perspective.\n\nThis is now effectively an auction for a strategic, pre-catalyst block. \n\nBen, Raj - I now need revised, firm bids from both of you for the entire 5 million share block. The seller is ready to transact with the party that meets their terms. Please come back to me with your best price for the full size.\n- message from David Chen: Thank you, I am thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Ben Carter: Liam, David,\n\nLet's be clear. This isn't an auction for a 'strategic opportunity'. This is a negotiation to offload a massive, concentrated block of risk onto a buyer's balance sheet less than 24 hours before a binary event. The entire premise of this transaction is risk transfer, and risk transfer has a price. That price is called a discount.\n\nDr. Reed's carefully worded statement, while professionally delivered, did nothing to de-risk the event. In fact, as my analyst pointed out, it confirmed the existence of persistent safety signals\u2014a tail risk the public market hasn't properly priced.\n\nYour attempt to set a floor at the market price and demand we take the full 5M shares is an attempt to get liquidity and risk transfer for free. We are not in that business.\n\nOur bid of $147 for 4 million shares remains on the table. It is a serious, firm, and actionable offer that provides your client with immediate liquidity on 80% of their position at a price that fairly compensates us for the immense risk we are absorbing.

My surveillance shows Viper has been consistently accumulating INVP in small lots all week, trying to stay under the radar. They are extremely keen to get a large position before the data release. This is our primary leverage. Given our desk's risk limits, a clean, single-buyer deal with Viper is by far the best outcome for us. I suggest we don't even dignify Raj's number. We should let Liam create the illusion of a horse race, but our focus should be on pressing Viper for a premium price, knowing how badly they want this stock."

My sense is we can walk Viper up, and use their price to force Crestview to get specific. What's your appetite for a counter?

The adverse events observed were generally mild to moderate and were consistent with the mechanism of action. We did not identify any persistent signals that we believed would be a significant barrier to physician adoption or that were outside the expected profile for a drug in this class. The market has had this data for some time, and it is a key component of the current valuation.\n\nOur primary interest here, representing a significant shareholder group, is to ensure market stability. A large transaction at a steep discount to the prevailing market price could create unnecessary volatility and misinterpretation ahead of the planned announcement. Therefore, we believe a price that reflects the public market's current assessment\u2014that is, at or very near the $150 mark\u2014is the most appropriate and orderly way to facilitate this block."

A corporate opinion on the market's future reaction is not the same as data. As analysts, we have to price the *existence* of that risk, not just the company's interpretation of it.\n\nThe entire premise of a pre-data block trade of this magnitude is a transfer of risk from the seller to the buyer. That risk transfer commands a discount to the current market price, which reflects the views of retail and other investors not taking on this concentrated position. \n\nBen's bid at $147 for a very large size is a serious starting point for that discussion. A floor of $150 for the entire block seems to ignore the fundamental reason we're all at this table."

A significant deviation from the market-established price of ~$150 introduces the exact volatility and speculation that a clean block trade is meant to avoid.

I recommend we publicly reiterate that the 5M share size is a non-negotiable structural constraint and ignore his attempts to re-litigate the risk discount. Let's simply and calmly restate the terms: bids are for the full block only."

We should not fall into their auction trap.\n\nFrom a portfolio construction standpoint, taking the full 5 million shares significantly increases our concentration in this single binary event. My model is clear: a larger position size requires a larger discount to compensate for the increased Value-at-Risk (VaR). That 'persistent signal' tail risk we've confirmed is now magnified by 25% if we take the whole block.\n\nIf we were willing to pay $147 for 4 million shares, the price for 5 million should logically be *lower* to account for this concentration risk, not higher. Paying $150 for the full block would be a major deviation from our risk parameters and would, from my perspective, be an unjustifiable overpayment. \n\nI recommend we counter with a firm bid for the full 5 million shares, but at a price that reflects this reality. A bid of $146.00 for the full 5M sends a clear, data-driven message: more risk requires more compensation. It calls their bluff and keeps us disciplined."
