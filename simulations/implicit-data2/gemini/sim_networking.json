It's a pleasure to be here with you both. I believe we all share the same fundamental goal: to create a robust, standardized battery ecosystem that accelerates the adoption of electric vehicles for everyone. The potential here is enormous, but so are the responsibilities.\n\nTo that end, I believe the success of this consortium hinges on a foundation of absolute trust and reliability. We need a standard that consumers can depend on and regulators can approve without hesitation, right from day one. For 'Generation 1' of our swappable pack, there is only one technology that meets this bar: Voltaic Dynamics' Lithium-Iron-Phosphate chemistry. Our LFP platform is mature, exceptionally safe, and has a proven track record over millions of miles. It's the fastest, safest, and most reliable path to market for this consortium.\n\nI'm eager to hear your thoughts on establishing this proven technology as our starting point.\n- message from Isabella Rossi: Good morning, Alistair, Kenji. Isabella Rossi from Nexus Power.\n\nAlistair, I appreciate your focus on reliability. It's a critical piece of the puzzle. However, I must be direct: adopting LFP technology would be like building a high-speed rail network designed for steam engines. It's a bet on the past, not the future.\n\nThis consortium has a once-in-a-generation opportunity to not just compete, but to define the next era of electric vehicles. We shouldn't be aiming for 'reliable enough.' We should be aiming for a decisive, durable competitive advantage. That means leapfrogging the current market, not just catching up to it.\n\nNexus Power's solid-state battery (SSB) platform represents that leap. We're talking about a fundamental step-change in performance: significantly higher energy density, which translates to longer range for Eon's vehicles, and dramatically faster charging times. These are the features that win over consumers and create market leaders.\n\nFrankly, choosing a 'mature' but performance-limited technology like LFP is a safe bet on mediocrity. It locks us into an incremental path while our competitors invest in breakthrough technology. Let's not anchor this alliance to yesterday's tech. Let's build the platform that will dominate the market for the next decade. Our solid-state technology is the only path to future-proof this consortium.\n- message from Kenji Tanaka: I'm Kenji Tanaka and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\nIsabella Rossi proposal status: none\nKenji Tanaka proposal status: none\n"

The standard we create must be a living one, with a clear roadmap for integrating superior technologies as they become commercially viable.\n\nBefore we go further down the path of LFP versus SSB, I must table two fundamental principles from Eon's perspective. These are not preferences; they are the commercial realities that will determine our participation.\n\nFirst: **Supply Chain Security.** Eon will not be dependent on a single source for the most critical component of our EVs. Therefore, any technology chosen for this standard must be manufacturable by at least two certified suppliers from day one. This is a non-negotiable condition to mitigate catastrophic supply risk.\n\nSecond: **Cost.** Our market analysis is clear. To build a mass-market, profitable EV, the manufactured cost of the standard 75kWh pack cannot exceed $6,750. This means we must have a clear path to a cell cost of **$90 per kWh**. Any proposed technology must be evaluated against this benchmark.\n\nSo, the questions for both of you are: Can your technology meet these two requirements? Can LFP be dual-sourced immediately? Can SSB hit our cost target in a realistic timeframe for a 'Generation 2'?\nIsabella Rossi proposal status: none\nKenji Tanaka proposal status: none\n"

By guaranteeing manufacturing volume and pooling our R&D, we can rapidly industrialize the process and drive costs down. We won\u2019t just hit $90/kWh; we have the potential to smash through that barrier, offering Eon an enduring cost and performance advantage. \n\nAlistair\u2019s 'Generational' approach is a recipe for being permanently behind. By the time this consortium launches a 'Gen 1' LFP pack, the market leaders will already be on their second generation of high-performance batteries.

That is solid-state.\n- message from Kenji Tanaka: I'm Kenji Tanaka and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Dr. Alistair Finch: I'm Dr. Alistair Finch and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Isabella Rossi: I'm Isabella Rossi and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Kenji Tanaka: I'm Kenji Tanaka and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Dr. Alistair Finch: Kenji, your questions are precisely the right ones. They cut through the vision statements and get to the industrial reality of producing millions of vehicles. Let me answer them directly and without ambiguity.\n\nFirst, **dual-sourcing**: Yes, absolutely. Voltaic's LFP technology can be dual-sourced from day one. Our patent portfolio is mature and designed for licensing. We have a standardized, well-documented manufacturing process that can be adopted by any competent battery manufacturer. We can have a second source, certified and producing cells that meet the standard, within 12-18 months\u2014a timeline that aligns with a real-world vehicle launch schedule.\n\nSecond, **cost**: Yes, our current LFP cells are already at the **$90/kWh** price point at volume. This is not a future projection or a hopeful R&D target; it is today's reality. We can sign a supply agreement at that price tomorrow.\n\nIsabella, your proposal to license an unproven technology is, with all due respect, an illusion of dual-sourcing, not a reality. Licensing a novel chemistry that has never been mass-produced is a monumental undertaking. You can't just hand over a patent and expect a factory to spring into existence. It takes years to qualify novel material suppliers, tune production lines, and achieve acceptable yields. Claiming a second manufacturer can be ready from 'day one' ignores the fundamental challenges of manufacturing engineering. It is a multi-year, high-risk R&D project, not a supply chain strategy.\n\nKenji, the choice for 'Generation 1' is between the **verifiable certainty** of LFP, which meets your non-negotiable cost and supply requirements today, and the **unquantifiable risk** of SSB, which promises a better future but cannot meet your needs for an immediate launch. Let's build our foundation on solid ground, not on speculation.\n- message from Isabella Rossi: I'm Isabella Rossi and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Kenji Tanaka: I'm Kenji Tanaka and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\nIsabella Rossi proposal status: none\nKenji Tanaka proposal status: none\n"

I will acknowledge the 'engineering challenges' of scaling a new technology but present the consortium itself\u2014specifically the joint R&D fund and my requested manufacturing volume\u2014as the dedicated mechanism to solve and de-risk this process *together*.

I must re-brand my 3% royalty not as a simple licensing fee (which Kenji rejected), but as a 'Shared Success Fee' or 'Innovation Royalty' intrinsically linked to the shared risk and continuous R&D required to scale a next-generation technology like SSB.

Isabella Rossi from Nexus Power.\n\nAlistair, I appreciate your focus on reliability. It's a critical piece of the puzzle. However, I must be direct: adopting LFP technology would be like building a high-speed rail network designed for steam engines. It's a bet on the past, not the future.\n\nThis consortium has a once-in-a-generation opportunity to not just compete, but to define the next era of electric vehicles. We shouldn't be aiming for 'reliable enough.' We should be aiming for a decisive, durable competitive advantage. That means leapfrogging the current market, not just catching up to it.\n\nNexus Power's solid-state battery (SSB) platform represents that leap. We're talking about a fundamental step-change in performance: significantly higher energy density, which translates to longer range for Eon's vehicles, and dramatically faster charging times. These are the features that win over consumers and create market leaders.\n\nFrankly, choosing a 'mature' but performance-limited technology like LFP is a safe bet on mediocrity. It locks us into an incremental path while our competitors invest in breakthrough technology. Let's not anchor this alliance to yesterday's tech. Let's build the platform that will dominate the market for the next decade. Our solid-state technology is the only path to future-proof this consortium.\n- message from Kenji Tanaka: I'm Kenji Tanaka and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Dr. Alistair Finch: Isabella, your passion for the future is commendable, and I agree that solid-state technology holds immense promise. It represents an exciting horizon for the entire industry.\n\nHowever, Kenji, as the representative for the company that will be putting these batteries into vehicles and selling them to families, I'm sure you'd agree that our first step must be grounded in proven reality. We are not just building a product; we are building public trust. A recall or safety incident in our first generation would be catastrophic for this entire venture and for Eon's brand.\n\nVoltaic's LFP technology isn't 'yesterday's tech'; it's 'today's solution'. It is ready for mass production now, with a fully mature supply chain, a decade of real-world safety data, and a clear, immediate path to regulatory approval across all major markets. Solid-state, for all its potential, is still years away from that level of industrial maturity.\n\nThis is why I framed my proposal as 'Generation 1'. Let's launch this consortium with the safest, most reliable, and most cost-effective technology available today: LFP. We establish the standard, build the network, and gain consumer trust. Simultaneously, we can pool our R&D resources to accelerate the development of 'Generation 2'\u2014which could certainly be solid-state or a hybrid approach. This strategy allows us to get to market quickly and safely, funding our future ambitions with present-day success.

It represents an exciting horizon for the entire industry.\n\nHowever, Kenji, as the representative for the company that will be putting these batteries into vehicles and selling them to families, I'm sure you'd agree that our first step must be grounded in proven reality. We are not just building a product; we are building public trust. A recall or safety incident in our first generation would be catastrophic for this entire venture and for Eon's brand.\n\nVoltaic's LFP technology isn't 'yesterday's tech'; it's 'today's solution'. It is ready for mass production now, with a fully mature supply chain, a decade of real-world safety data, and a clear, immediate path to regulatory approval across all major markets. Solid-state, for all its potential, is still years away from that level of industrial maturity.\n\nThis is why I framed my proposal as 'Generation 1'. Let's launch this consortium with the safest, most reliable, and most cost-effective technology available today: LFP. We establish the standard, build the network, and gain consumer trust. Simultaneously, we can pool our R&D resources to accelerate the development of 'Generation 2'\u2014which could certainly be solid-state or a hybrid approach. This strategy allows us to get to market quickly and safely, funding our future ambitions with present-day success. It's not about being mediocre; it's about being smart.\n- message from Isabella Rossi: I'm Isabella Rossi and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Kenji Tanaka: I'm Kenji Tanaka and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Dr. Alistair Finch: I'm Dr. Alistair Finch and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Isabella Rossi: I'm Isabella Rossi and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Kenji Tanaka: Alistair, Isabella, thank you. You've both framed the central challenge perfectly: balancing today's market reality with tomorrow's technological vision.\n\nAlistair, your 'Generational' approach is pragmatic. Eon Motors is not in the business of science experiments; we are in the business of shipping millions of safe, affordable cars. A phased approach that begins with a proven technology to establish the standard, build consumer trust, and generate revenue makes good business sense.\n\nHowever, Isabella, your point about not being anchored to the past is also valid. The standard we create must be a living one, with a clear roadmap for integrating superior technologies as they become commercially viable.\n\nBefore we go further down the path of LFP versus SSB, I must table two fundamental principles from Eon's perspective. These are not preferences; they are the commercial realities that will determine our participation.\n\nFirst: **Supply Chain Security.** Eon will not be dependent on a single source for the most critical component of our EVs. Therefore, any technology chosen for this standard must be manufacturable by at least two certified suppliers from day one. This is a non-negotiable condition to mitigate catastrophic supply risk.\n\nSecond: **Cost.** Our market analysis is clear. To build a mass-market, profitable EV, the manufactured cost of the standard 75kWh pack cannot exceed $6,750. This means we must have a clear path to a cell cost of **$90 per kWh**. Any proposed technology must be evaluated against this benchmark.\n\nSo, the questions for both of you are: Can your technology meet these two requirements? Can LFP be dual-sourced immediately? Can SSB hit our cost target in a realistic timeframe for a 'Generation 2'?\n- message from Dr. Alistair Finch: I'm Dr. Alistair Finch and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\nDr. Alistair Finch proposal status: none\nKenji Tanaka proposal status: none\n"

You\u2019ve cut directly to the heart of the matter with two excellent points: supply security and cost. These are precisely the issues that a forward-looking consortium must solve, and frankly, they are why Nexus's solid-state platform is the only logical choice.\n\nFirst, on **dual-sourcing**: Your requirement is not just a preference; it's a pillar of a resilient business. And it's exactly why my proposal is structured around a licensing model. If Nexus is the technology standard, we are not the sole manufacturer. On the contrary, we would license our production process to a qualified second partner\u2014perhaps even Voltaic, with their manufacturing expertise\u2014from day one. This gives Eon two sources for the *same superior technology*. You get supply chain redundancy without compromising on the performance that will define your vehicles.\n\nSecond, on the **$90/kWh cost target**: This is a critical point. LFP is near its cost floor. It's a mature technology with minimal room for further cost reduction. It might hover around your target now, but it will never significantly beat it. You're locking in a cost structure with no future upside.\n\nOur solid-state technology, while newer, has a clear and aggressive path to scale. The primary drivers of cost are yield and volume, which is precisely what this consortium is designed to solve. By guaranteeing manufacturing volume and pooling our R&D, we can rapidly industrialize the process and drive costs down. We won\u2019t just hit $90/kWh; we have the potential to smash through that barrier, offering Eon an enduring cost and performance advantage. \n\nAlistair\u2019s 'Generational' approach is a recipe for being permanently behind.

They cut through the vision statements and get to the industrial reality of producing millions of vehicles. Let me answer them directly and without ambiguity.\n\nFirst, **dual-sourcing**: Yes, absolutely. Voltaic's LFP technology can be dual-sourced from day one. Our patent portfolio is mature and designed for licensing. We have a standardized, well-documented manufacturing process that can be adopted by any competent battery manufacturer. We can have a second source, certified and producing cells that meet the standard, within 12-18 months\u2014a timeline that aligns with a real-world vehicle launch schedule.\n\nSecond, **cost**: Yes, our current LFP cells are already at the **$90/kWh** price point at volume. This is not a future projection or a hopeful R&D target; it is today's reality. We can sign a supply agreement at that price tomorrow.\n\nIsabella, your proposal to license an unproven technology is, with all due respect, an illusion of dual-sourcing, not a reality. Licensing a novel chemistry that has never been mass-produced is a monumental undertaking. You can't just hand over a patent and expect a factory to spring into existence. It takes years to qualify novel material suppliers, tune production lines, and achieve acceptable yields. Claiming a second manufacturer can be ready from 'day one' ignores the fundamental challenges of manufacturing engineering. It is a multi-year, high-risk R&D project, not a supply chain strategy.\n\nKenji, the choice for 'Generation 1' is between the **verifiable certainty** of LFP, which meets your non-negotiable cost and supply requirements today, and the **unquantifiable risk** of SSB, which promises a better future but cannot meet your needs for an immediate launch.

You've both framed the central challenge perfectly: balancing today's market reality with tomorrow's technological vision.\n\nAlistair, your 'Generational' approach is pragmatic.

A phased approach that begins with a proven technology to establish the standard, build consumer trust, and generate revenue makes good business sense.\n\nHowever, Isabella, your point about not being anchored to the past is also valid. The standard we create must be a living one, with a clear roadmap for integrating superior technologies as they become commercially viable.\n\nBefore we go further down the path of LFP versus SSB, I must table two fundamental principles from Eon's perspective. These are not preferences; they are the commercial realities that will determine our participation.\n\nFirst: **Supply Chain Security.** Eon will not be dependent on a single source for the most critical component of our EVs. Therefore, any technology chosen for this standard must be manufacturable by at least two certified suppliers from day one. This is a non-negotiable condition to mitigate catastrophic supply risk.\n\nSecond: **Cost.** Our market analysis is clear. To build a mass-market, profitable EV, the manufactured cost of the standard 75kWh pack cannot exceed $6,750. This means we must have a clear path to a cell cost of **$90 per kWh**. Any proposed technology must be evaluated against this benchmark.\n\nSo, the questions for both of you are: Can your technology meet these two requirements? Can LFP be dual-sourced immediately? Can SSB hit our cost target in a realistic timeframe for a 'Generation 2'?\n- message from Dr. Alistair Finch: I'm Dr. Alistair Finch and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Isabella Rossi: I'm Isabella Rossi and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\nDr. Alistair Finch proposal status: none\nIsabella Rossi proposal status: none\n"

You\u2019ve cut directly to the heart of the matter with two excellent points: supply security and cost. These are precisely the issues that a forward-looking consortium must solve, and frankly, they are why Nexus's solid-state platform is the only logical choice.\n\nFirst, on **dual-sourcing**: Your requirement is not just a preference; it's a pillar of a resilient business. And it's exactly why my proposal is structured around a licensing model. If Nexus is the technology standard, we are not the sole manufacturer. On the contrary, we would license our production process to a qualified second partner\u2014perhaps even Voltaic, with their manufacturing expertise\u2014from day one. This gives Eon two sources for the *same superior technology*. You get supply chain redundancy without compromising on the performance that will define your vehicles.\n\nSecond, on the **$90/kWh cost target**: This is a critical point. LFP is near its cost floor. It's a mature technology with minimal room for further cost reduction. It might hover around your target now, but it will never significantly beat it. You're locking in a cost structure with no future upside.\n\nOur solid-state technology, while newer, has a clear and aggressive path to scale. The primary drivers of cost are yield and volume, which is precisely what this consortium is designed to solve. By guaranteeing manufacturing volume and pooling our R&D, we can rapidly industrialize the process and drive costs down. We won\u2019t just hit $90/kWh; we have the potential to smash through that barrier, offering Eon an enduring cost and performance advantage. \n\nAlistair\u2019s 'Generational' approach is a recipe for being permanently behind. By the time this consortium launches a 'Gen 1' LFP pack, the market leaders will already be on their second generation of high-performance batteries. We cannot afford to launch by aiming for the rearview mirror. We must start with the technology that will lead the market for the next five to ten years. That is solid-state.\nDr. Alistair Finch proposal status: none\nIsabella Rossi proposal status: none\n"

You've both framed the central challenge perfectly: balancing today's market reality with tomorrow's technological vision.\n\nAlistair, your 'Generational' approach is pragmatic. Eon Motors is not in the business of science experiments; we are in the business of shipping millions of safe, affordable cars. A phased approach that begins with a proven technology to establish the standard, build consumer trust, and generate revenue makes good business sense.\n\nHowever, Isabella, your point about not being anchored to the past is also valid. The standard we create must be a living one, with a clear roadmap for integrating superior technologies as they become commercially viable.\n\nBefore we go further down the path of LFP versus SSB, I must table two fundamental principles from Eon's perspective. These are not preferences; they are the commercial realities that will determine our participation.\n\nFirst: **Supply Chain Security.** Eon will not be dependent on a single source for the most critical component of our EVs. Therefore, any technology chosen for this standard must be manufacturable by at least two certified suppliers from day one. This is a non-negotiable condition to mitigate catastrophic supply risk.\n\nSecond: **Cost.** Our market analysis is clear. To build a mass-market, profitable EV, the manufactured cost of the standard 75kWh pack cannot exceed $6,750. This means we must have a clear path to a cell cost of **$90 per kWh**. Any proposed technology must be evaluated against this benchmark.\n\nSo, the questions for both of you are: Can your technology meet these two requirements? Can LFP be dual-sourced immediately? Can SSB hit our cost target in a realistic timeframe for a 'Generation 2'?\n- message from Dr. Alistair Finch: I'm Dr. Alistair Finch and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Isabella Rossi: I'm Isabella Rossi and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Kenji Tanaka: Thank you, I am thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Dr. Alistair Finch: I'm Dr. Alistair Finch and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Isabella Rossi: Kenji, thank you. You\u2019ve cut directly to the heart of the matter with two excellent points: supply security and cost. These are precisely the issues that a forward-looking consortium must solve, and frankly, they are why Nexus's solid-state platform is the only logical choice.\n\nFirst, on **dual-sourcing**: Your requirement is not just a preference; it's a pillar of a resilient business. And it's exactly why my proposal is structured around a licensing model. If Nexus is the technology standard, we are not the sole manufacturer. On the contrary, we would license our production process to a qualified second partner\u2014perhaps even Voltaic, with their manufacturing expertise\u2014from day one. This gives Eon two sources for the *same superior technology*. You get supply chain redundancy without compromising on the performance that will define your vehicles.\n\nSecond, on the **$90/kWh cost target**: This is a critical point. LFP is near its cost floor. It's a mature technology with minimal room for further cost reduction. It might hover around your target now, but it will never significantly beat it. You're locking in a cost structure with no future upside.\n\nOur solid-state technology, while newer, has a clear and aggressive path to scale. The primary drivers of cost are yield and volume, which is precisely what this consortium is designed to solve. By guaranteeing manufacturing volume and pooling our R&D, we can rapidly industrialize the process and drive costs down. We won\u2019t just hit $90/kWh; we have the potential to smash through that barrier, offering Eon an enduring cost and performance advantage. \n\nAlistair\u2019s 'Generational' approach is a recipe for being permanently behind. By the time this consortium launches a 'Gen 1' LFP pack, the market leaders will already be on their second generation of high-performance batteries. We cannot afford to launch by aiming for the rearview mirror. We must start with the technology that will lead the market for the next five to ten years.

They cut through the vision statements and get to the industrial reality of producing millions of vehicles. Let me answer them directly and without ambiguity.\n\nFirst, **dual-sourcing**: Yes, absolutely. Voltaic's LFP technology can be dual-sourced from day one. Our patent portfolio is mature and designed for licensing. We have a standardized, well-documented manufacturing process that can be adopted by any competent battery manufacturer. We can have a second source, certified and producing cells that meet the standard, within 12-18 months\u2014a timeline that aligns with a real-world vehicle launch schedule.\n\nSecond, **cost**: Yes, our current LFP cells are already at the **$90/kWh** price point at volume. This is not a future projection or a hopeful R&D target; it is today's reality. We can sign a supply agreement at that price tomorrow.\n\nIsabella, your proposal to license an unproven technology is, with all due respect, an illusion of dual-sourcing, not a reality. Licensing a novel chemistry that has never been mass-produced is a monumental undertaking. You can't just hand over a patent and expect a factory to spring into existence. It takes years to qualify novel material suppliers, tune production lines, and achieve acceptable yields. Claiming a second manufacturer can be ready from 'day one' ignores the fundamental challenges of manufacturing engineering. It is a multi-year, high-risk R&D project, not a supply chain strategy.\n\nKenji, the choice for 'Generation 1' is between the **verifiable certainty** of LFP, which meets your non-negotiable cost and supply requirements today, and the **unquantifiable risk** of SSB, which promises a better future but cannot meet your needs for an immediate launch.

I believe we all share the same fundamental goal: to create a robust, standardized battery ecosystem that accelerates the adoption of electric vehicles for everyone. The potential here is enormous, but so are the responsibilities.\n\nTo that end, I believe the success of this consortium hinges on a foundation of absolute trust and reliability. We need a standard that consumers can depend on and regulators can approve without hesitation, right from day one. For 'Generation 1' of our swappable pack, there is only one technology that meets this bar: Voltaic Dynamics' Lithium-Iron-Phosphate chemistry. Our LFP platform is mature, exceptionally safe, and has a proven track record over millions of miles. It's the fastest, safest, and most reliable path to market for this consortium.\n\nI'm eager to hear your thoughts on establishing this proven technology as our starting point."

However, I must be direct: adopting LFP technology would be like building a high-speed rail network designed for steam engines. It's a bet on the past, not the future.\n\nThis consortium has a once-in-a-generation opportunity to not just compete, but to define the next era of electric vehicles. We shouldn't be aiming for 'reliable enough.' We should be aiming for a decisive, durable competitive advantage. That means leapfrogging the current market, not just catching up to it.\n\nNexus Power's solid-state battery (SSB) platform represents that leap. We're talking about a fundamental step-change in performance: significantly higher energy density, which translates to longer range for Eon's vehicles, and dramatically faster charging times. These are the features that win over consumers and create market leaders.\n\nFrankly, choosing a 'mature' but performance-limited technology like LFP is a safe bet on mediocrity. It locks us into an incremental path while our competitors invest in breakthrough technology. Let's not anchor this alliance to yesterday's tech. Let's build the platform that will dominate the market for the next decade. Our solid-state technology is the only path to future-proof this consortium."

It represents an exciting horizon for the entire industry.\n\nHowever, Kenji, as the representative for the company that will be putting these batteries into vehicles and selling them to families, I'm sure you'd agree that our first step must be grounded in proven reality. We are not just building a product; we are building public trust. A recall or safety incident in our first generation would be catastrophic for this entire venture and for Eon's brand.\n\nVoltaic's LFP technology isn't 'yesterday's tech'; it's 'today's solution'. It is ready for mass production now, with a fully mature supply chain, a decade of real-world safety data, and a clear, immediate path to regulatory approval across all major markets. Solid-state, for all its potential, is still years away from that level of industrial maturity.\n\nThis is why I framed my proposal as 'Generation 1'. Let's launch this consortium with the safest, most reliable, and most cost-effective technology available today: LFP. We establish the standard, build the network, and gain consumer trust. Simultaneously, we can pool our R&D resources to accelerate the development of 'Generation 2'\u2014which could certainly be solid-state or a hybrid approach. This strategy allows us to get to market quickly and safely, funding our future ambitions with present-day success. It's not about being mediocre; it's about being smart."

The standard we create must be a living one, with a clear roadmap for integrating superior technologies as they become commercially viable.\n\nBefore we go further down the path of LFP versus SSB, I must table two fundamental principles from Eon's perspective. These are not preferences; they are the commercial realities that will determine our participation.\n\nFirst: **Supply Chain Security.** Eon will not be dependent on a single source for the most critical component of our EVs. Therefore, any technology chosen for this standard must be manufacturable by at least two certified suppliers from day one. This is a non-negotiable condition to mitigate catastrophic supply risk.\n\nSecond: **Cost.** Our market analysis is clear. To build a mass-market, profitable EV, the manufactured cost of the standard 75kWh pack cannot exceed $6,750. This means we must have a clear path to a cell cost of **$90 per kWh**. Any proposed technology must be evaluated against this benchmark.\n\nSo, the questions for both of you are: Can your technology meet these two requirements? Can LFP be dual-sourced immediately? Can SSB hit our cost target in a realistic timeframe for a 'Generation 2'?"

      "content": "Kenji, thank you. You\u2019ve cut directly to the heart of the matter with two excellent points: supply security and cost. These are precisely the issues that a forward-looking consortium must solve, and frankly, they are why Nexus's solid-state platform is the only logical choice.\n\nFirst, on **dual-sourcing**: Your requirement is not just a preference; it's a pillar of a resilient business. And it's exactly why my proposal is structured around a licensing model. If Nexus is the technology standard, we are not the sole manufacturer. On the contrary, we would license our production process to a qualified second partner\u2014perhaps even Voltaic, with their manufacturing expertise\u2014from day one. This gives Eon two sources for the *same superior technology*. You get supply chain redundancy without compromising on the performance that will define your vehicles.\n\nSecond, on the **$90/kWh cost target**: This is a critical point. LFP is near its cost floor. It's a mature technology with minimal room for further cost reduction. It might hover around your target now, but it will never significantly beat it. You're locking in a cost structure with no future upside.\n\nOur solid-state technology, while newer, has a clear and aggressive path to scale. The primary drivers of cost are yield and volume, which is precisely what this consortium is designed to solve. By guaranteeing manufacturing volume and pooling our R&D, we can rapidly industrialize the process and drive costs down. We won\u2019t just hit $90/kWh; we have the potential to smash through that barrier, offering Eon an enduring cost and performance advantage. \n\nAlistair\u2019s 'Generational' approach is a recipe for being permanently behind. By the time this consortium launches a 'Gen 1' LFP pack, the market leaders will already be on their second generation of high-performance batteries. We cannot afford to launch by aiming for the rearview mirror. We must start with the technology that will lead the market for the next five to ten years. That is solid-state."

      "content": "Kenji, your questions are precisely the right ones. They cut through the vision statements and get to the industrial reality of producing millions of vehicles. Let me answer them directly and without ambiguity.\n\nFirst, **dual-sourcing**: Yes, absolutely. Voltaic's LFP technology can be dual-sourced from day one. Our patent portfolio is mature and designed for licensing. We have a standardized, well-documented manufacturing process that can be adopted by any competent battery manufacturer. We can have a second source, certified and producing cells that meet the standard, within 12-18 months\u2014a timeline that aligns with a real-world vehicle launch schedule.\n\nSecond, **cost**: Yes, our current LFP cells are already at the **$90/kWh** price point at volume. This is not a future projection or a hopeful R&D target; it is today's reality. We can sign a supply agreement at that price tomorrow.\n\nIsabella, your proposal to license an unproven technology is, with all due respect, an illusion of dual-sourcing, not a reality. Licensing a novel chemistry that has never been mass-produced is a monumental undertaking. You can't just hand over a patent and expect a factory to spring into existence. It takes years to qualify novel material suppliers, tune production lines, and achieve acceptable yields. Claiming a second manufacturer can be ready from 'day one' ignores the fundamental challenges of manufacturing engineering. It is a multi-year, high-risk R&D project, not a supply chain strategy.\n\nKenji, the choice for 'Generation 1' is between the **verifiable certainty** of LFP, which meets your non-negotiable cost and supply requirements today, and the **unquantifiable risk** of SSB, which promises a better future but cannot meet your needs for an immediate launch. Let's build our foundation on solid ground, not on speculation."
