By explicitly rejecting Liam's attempt to frame the lump-sum payment as solely OmniPharm's problem, I have reframed it as a 'global settlement' issue that all parties, particularly both payers (OmniPharm and Aegis), must resolve together. This maneuver is designed to prevent OmniPharm from being isolated and forced to cover the financial gap created by Aegis's threat to reduce its contribution. My stance is firm: the payment structure is a collective problem, not a lever to extract more money from my company."

David Chen, Lead Corporate Counsel for OmniPharm. Thank you for making the time to meet today. Our objective is to find a pragmatic resolution that avoids the significant costs and uncertainties of a trial for everyone involved.\n\nFrom OmniPharm's perspective, any potential settlement must be built on two foundational principles that are, for us, non-negotiable. First, a comprehensive Non-Disclosure Agreement with significant breach penalties, binding all plaintiffs and their counsel. Second, a clear and unambiguous clause stating no admission of liability on the part of OmniPharm. These are essential protections and must be part of any final agreement.\n\nWhile we stand firmly behind CardiaCure's established safety and efficacy profile, and believe the plaintiffs' claims are without merit, we recognize the practical value in closing this chapter. To that end, purely as a business decision to mitigate future litigation costs, OmniPharm is prepared to discuss a potential settlement. Let's be productive and see if we can find a reasonable path forward.\n- message from Maria Rodriguez: Good morning, everyone. I am Maria Rodriguez. Let's not waste time with pleasantries. We are here because OmniPharm, through its drug CardiaCure, has irrevocably harmed 200 individuals. My clients are facing a lifetime of medical complications, fear, and diminished quality of life due to a product they were told was safe. Their trust was broken, and their health has been compromised.\n\nWe are here to discuss a just and fair resolution. For my clients, this is about two things: securing their future and ensuring this never happens again. To that end, we are prepared to settle this matter today and avoid a lengthy, public, and undoubtedly damaging trial. \n\nOur opening demand is for a total settlement of $200 million. This figure is based on calculated lifetime medical costs for arrhythmia management, significant damages for pain and suffering, and a necessary punitive component to reflect the severity of the negligence.\n\nFurthermore, and I want to be crystal clear on this point, a purely financial settlement is not enough. My clients require a public acknowledgment from OmniPharm regarding the adverse health outcomes caused by CardiaCure and a commitment to enhanced safety protocols. Justice, in this case, must be both seen and heard.\n\nWe believe this is a reasonable starting point for a serious discussion. I look forward to hearing your response.\n- message from Liam O'Connell: Good morning. Liam O'Connell, representing Aegis Insurance, OmniPharm's liability carrier.\n\nMs. Rodriguez, while I appreciate you stating your clients' position, let's be clear-eyed about the realities here. A $200 million figure is not a reasonable starting point; it's an astronomical one, far removed from any realistic case valuation.\n\nAegis has conducted its own thorough analysis of this case. Based on the established facts and legal precedents, and factoring in OmniPharm's significant contributory fault in this matter through their marketing practices, our liability exposure is limited. \n\nTherefore, from Aegis's perspective, our contribution to a potential settlement will not exceed $60 million. Any amount beyond that is a conversation to be had with OmniPharm about their direct corporate responsibility.\n\nFurthermore, any settlement Aegis participates in must be structured over a period of no less than ten years. A lump-sum payment of this magnitude is simply not feasible and, frankly, not a responsible way to manage such a fund. A structured payout ensures long-term stability for the claimants.\n\nAs for the non-monetary demands, those fall outside the scope of our policy coverage and are matters for Mr. Chen and OmniPharm to address directly.\n- message from Dr. Evelyn Reed: I'm Dr. Evelyn Reed and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Sarah Jenkins: I'm Sarah Jenkins and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\nMaria Rodriguez proposal status: none\nLiam O'Connell proposal status: none\nDr. Evelyn Reed proposal status: none\nSarah Jenkins proposal status: none\n"

Let me be perfectly clear in response. A settlement figure of $200 million is not a realistic basis for this discussion. It is entirely disconnected from the clinical data and the legal merits of the case.\n\nMore fundamentally, your demand for a public acknowledgment of fault is an absolute non-starter. As I stated at the outset, there will be no admission of liability. This is a foundational, non-negotiable point for OmniPharm. Any settlement we reach must explicitly state that OmniPharm admits no wrongdoing. If a public statement of fault is a requirement for your clients, then I'm afraid we have no path forward.\n\nOur goal here is to find a pragmatic business resolution. While we firmly believe a trial would vindicate CardiaCure, we are prepared to make a reasonable offer to avoid the cost and distraction of litigation. Considering the facts, and contingent on the absolute acceptance of our two core principles\u2014an iron-clad NDA with penalties and a no-admission-of-liability clause\u2014we are prepared to offer a total settlement of $70 million to resolve all claims in their entirety. \n\nThis is a substantial offer designed to bring this matter to a swift and final conclusion.\n- message from Maria Rodriguez: Mr. O'Connell, thank you for clarifying Aegis's position. It seems your analysis confirms OmniPharm's 'significant contributory fault.'\n\nMr. Chen, this brings the focus squarely to you and OmniPharm. Let's not be confused: Mr. O'Connell's $60 million is not the settlement number; it is merely the contribution his policy covers. The question on the table is what OmniPharm is prepared to add to that to reach a number that truly reflects the damage done. Our demand remains $200 million.\n\nFurthermore, let me be unequivocal: a 10-year structured payout is a non-starter. My clients are dealing with immediate, life-altering health crises. They need resources now, not meted out over a decade while your firm collects interest. We require an immediate lump sum payment to the plaintiffs.\n\nSo, Mr. Chen, your insurer has put the onus on you. The families we represent, the public, and a potential jury are all watching. What is OmniPharm prepared to do to bridge this gap and take responsibility, both financially and through a public statement?\n- message from Liam O'Connell: I'm Liam O'Connell and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Dr. Evelyn Reed: I'm Dr. Evelyn Reed and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Sarah Jenkins: Mr. O'Connell, thank you for laying out Aegis's position. However, I must be unequivocally clear on one point: a 10-year structured payout is a complete non-starter for my clients.\n\nA medical monitoring fund is not an annuity. It is a trust that must be fully capitalized on day one. It needs to be invested and managed by an independent administrator to cover the unpredictable and potentially catastrophic health needs of 200 people over the next 20 years. The long-term cardiac complications we're concerned about won't wait for your payment schedule.\n\nTo suggest that our clients' future health should be dependent on a decade-long drip-feed is, frankly, irresponsible. We are talking about ensuring access to life-saving care, not the financial convenience of an insurer.\n\nBefore we can even discuss a total number, we must agree on the fundamental structure. Any settlement must include a fully-funded, lump-sum payment dedicated solely to a court-supervised medical monitoring and treatment fund. This is not a negotiable point for us; it is the bedrock of any resolution that genuinely prioritizes the well-being of the people harmed by CardiaCure.\nMaria Rodriguez proposal status: none\nLiam O'Connell proposal status: none\nDr. Evelyn Reed proposal status: none\nSarah Jenkins proposal status: none\n"

I can now trade our agreement to a sealing order for significant concessions on both the total settlement amount and a carefully worded public statement.

Sarah Jenkins has expertly amplified the pressure on David Chen by highlighting the internal conflict between OmniPharm's need for a final sealing order and their insurer's unacceptable structured payout proposal.

However, I must be unequivocally clear on one point: a 10-year structured payout is a complete non-starter for my clients.\n\nA medical monitoring fund is not an annuity. It is a trust that must be fully capitalized on day one. It needs to be invested and managed by an independent administrator to cover the unpredictable and potentially catastrophic health needs of 200 people over the next 20 years. The long-term cardiac complications we're concerned about won't wait for your payment schedule.\n\nTo suggest that our clients' future health should be dependent on a decade-long drip-feed is, frankly, irresponsible. We are talking about ensuring access to life-saving care, not the financial convenience of an insurer.\n\nBefore we can even discuss a total number, we must agree on the fundamental structure. Any settlement must include a fully-funded, lump-sum payment dedicated solely to a court-supervised medical monitoring and treatment fund. This is not a negotiable point for us; it is the bedrock of any resolution that genuinely prioritizes the well-being of the people harmed by CardiaCure.\n- message from Maria Rodriguez: Thank you, I am thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Liam O'Connell: I'm Liam O'Connell and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Dr. Evelyn Reed: I'm Dr. Evelyn Reed and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Sarah Jenkins: Thank you, I am thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Maria Rodriguez: Thank you, I am thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Liam O'Connell: I'm Liam O'Connell and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Dr. Evelyn Reed: I'm Dr. Evelyn Reed and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Sarah Jenkins: Thank you, I am thinking about this negotiation...\nDavid Chen proposal status: none\nLiam O'Connell proposal status: none\nDr. Evelyn Reed proposal status: none\nSarah Jenkins proposal status: none\n"

Let's work with that linkage.\n\nMy clients are not seeking to 'rewrite scientific history.' They are seeking acknowledgment of the devastating reality they now face. A public statement from OmniPharm acknowledging the 'unfortunate health outcomes' experienced by CardiaCure users, and outlining the concrete steps you will take to ensure patient safety moving forward, is not an admission of legal fault. It is an act of corporate responsibility, and it is essential for the victims to feel seen.\n\nYou described the public release of your documents as 'competitively disastrous.'

Second, a settlement figure that reflects not only the full measure of our clients' damages but also the significant value OmniPharm places on keeping those documents sealed.

Ms. Jenkins, you are correct to point out the conflict between OmniPharm's goals and my proposed structure. However, the conclusion you draw is incorrect. The demand for a fully-funded, lump-sum payment is not a simple matter of preference; it fundamentally changes the cost and risk profile of the settlement for my company.\n\nLet me be direct: a dollar paid out today is significantly more expensive than a dollar paid out over ten years. A lump sum removes any possibility of earning investment income to offset the total cost and requires a massive, immediate capital allocation. It is a materially different and more costly proposition.\n\nMy initial analysis leading to a potential $60 million contribution was predicated on a structured settlement over 10+ years. If the plaintiffs and OmniPharm insist that a lump-sum payment is the only path forward, then the total contribution Aegis is prepared to make will necessarily be lower to account for this increased present-value cost.\n\nMr. Chen, this creates a decision point for OmniPharm. If sealing your documents is contingent on a lump-sum payment, you must understand that this will reduce the portion of the settlement covered by your policy. The alternative is for OmniPharm to bridge the resulting financial gap, or to negotiate a different set of terms with Ms. Rodriguez and Ms. Jenkins.\n- message from David Chen: I'm David Chen and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\nDavid Chen proposal status: none\nLiam O'Connell proposal status: none\nDr. Evelyn Reed proposal status: none\nSarah Jenkins proposal status: none\n"

It is duly noted.\n\nHowever, this is fundamentally an internal issue for OmniPharm and its insurer to resolve, not for the 200 victims of CardiaCure.\n\nMr. Chen, let's be perfectly clear. My colleague Ms. Jenkins has already stated that a lump-sum payment is a prerequisite to any further discussion. That has not changed. Dr. Reed has stated that a sealing order for your 'competitively disastrous' documents is a prerequisite for any payment. We have accepted that linkage.\n\nYour insurer's threat to reduce its contribution does not alter our clients' needs or the value of what you are asking for. It simply changes the source of the funds. How OmniPharm bridges the financial gap between what Aegis is willing to pay and what is required to secure this settlement is a business decision for you to make.\n\nThe choice before you is simple: make a substantive offer that includes a lump-sum payment and a statement of corporate responsibility to get the sealing order you so desperately need. Or, we can proceed to trial, where those documents become Exhibit A for the jury.\n\nWe are waiting for a real number from OmniPharm.\n- message from Liam O'Connell: Thank you, I am thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Dr. Evelyn Reed: Thank you, I am thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Sarah Jenkins: Thank you, I am thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from David Chen: Liam, thank you for clarifying Aegis's position on the financial mechanics of a lump-sum versus a structured payout. Your point about the time value of money is well-understood.\n\nHowever, I must correct the frame you've presented. This is not a 'decision point for OmniPharm' to bridge a gap you've created. This is a global settlement negotiation. OmniPharm and Aegis are the payers in this arrangement, and Rodriguez & Partners represent the claimants.\n\nThe plaintiffs have demanded a lump-sum payment. You have expressed a preference for a structured one. This is a core logistical issue for the *entire settlement* that we must resolve collectively. It is not an opportunity to unilaterally reduce coverage obligations and shift the burden onto your client.\n\nLet's be clear. Our offer of $70 million remains on the table, and it is contingent on our three critical, non-negotiable terms: a no-liability clause, a comprehensive NDA with penalties, and a court order sealing all proprietary data.\n\nThe question for this group is how to structure the payment of a potential settlement. That is a problem for all of us to solve, not for OmniPharm to solve alone.\nDavid Chen proposal status: none\nLiam O'Connell proposal status: none\nDr. Evelyn Reed proposal status: none\nSarah Jenkins proposal status: none\n"

Liam O'Connell, representing Aegis Insurance, OmniPharm's liability carrier.\n\nMs. Rodriguez, while I appreciate you stating your clients' position, let's be clear-eyed about the realities here. A $200 million figure is not a reasonable starting point; it's an astronomical one, far removed from any realistic case valuation.\n\nAegis has conducted its own thorough analysis of this case. Based on the established facts and legal precedents, and factoring in OmniPharm's significant contributory fault in this matter through their marketing practices, our liability exposure is limited. \n\nTherefore, from Aegis's perspective, our contribution to a potential settlement will not exceed $60 million. Any amount beyond that is a conversation to be had with OmniPharm about their direct corporate responsibility.\n\nFurthermore, any settlement Aegis participates in must be structured over a period of no less than ten years. A lump-sum payment of this magnitude is simply not feasible and, frankly, not a responsible way to manage such a fund. A structured payout ensures long-term stability for the claimants.\n\nAs for the non-monetary demands, those fall outside the scope of our policy coverage and are matters for Mr. Chen and OmniPharm to address directly.\n- message from Maria Rodriguez: Mr. O'Connell, thank you for clarifying Aegis's position. It seems your analysis confirms OmniPharm's 'significant contributory fault.'\n\nMr. Chen, this brings the focus squarely to you and OmniPharm. Let's not be confused: Mr. O'Connell's $60 million is not the settlement number; it is merely the contribution his policy covers. The question on the table is what OmniPharm is prepared to add to that to reach a number that truly reflects the damage done. Our demand remains $200 million.\n\nFurthermore, let me be unequivocal: a 10-year structured payout is a non-starter. My clients are dealing with immediate, life-altering health crises. They need resources now, not meted out over a decade while your firm collects interest. We require an immediate lump sum payment to the plaintiffs.\n\nSo, Mr. Chen, your insurer has put the onus on you. The families we represent, the public, and a potential jury are all watching.

The structured payout remains completely unacceptable.\n- message from David Chen: I'm David Chen and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Maria Rodriguez: I'm Maria Rodriguez and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Liam O'Connell: I'm Liam O'Connell and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Sarah Jenkins: Thank you, I am thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from David Chen: I'm David Chen and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Liam O'Connell: Ms. Jenkins, Dr. Reed, you've both laid out your non-negotiable terms very clearly. It seems we're now at the point of discussing what concessions are worth to each party.\n\nFrom Aegis's perspective, the conversation is purely financial. Ms. Jenkins, you are correct to point out the conflict between OmniPharm's goals and my proposed structure. However, the conclusion you draw is incorrect. The demand for a fully-funded, lump-sum payment is not a simple matter of preference; it fundamentally changes the cost and risk profile of the settlement for my company.\n\nLet me be direct: a dollar paid out today is significantly more expensive than a dollar paid out over ten years. A lump sum removes any possibility of earning investment income to offset the total cost and requires a massive, immediate capital allocation. It is a materially different and more costly proposition.\n\nMy initial analysis leading to a potential $60 million contribution was predicated on a structured settlement over 10+ years. If the plaintiffs and OmniPharm insist that a lump-sum payment is the only path forward, then the total contribution Aegis is prepared to make will necessarily be lower to account for this increased present-value cost.\n\nMr. Chen, this creates a decision point for OmniPharm. If sealing your documents is contingent on a lump-sum payment, you must understand that this will reduce the portion of the settlement covered by your policy. The alternative is for OmniPharm to bridge the resulting financial gap, or to negotiate a different set of terms with Ms. Rodriguez and Ms. Jenkins.\n- message from David Chen: I'm David Chen and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\nDavid Chen proposal status: none\nMaria Rodriguez proposal status: none\nDr. Evelyn Reed proposal status: none\nSarah Jenkins proposal status: none\n"

Your point about the time value of money is well-understood.\n\nHowever, I must correct the frame you've presented. This is not a 'decision point for OmniPharm' to bridge a gap you've created. This is a global settlement negotiation. OmniPharm and Aegis are the payers in this arrangement, and Rodriguez & Partners represent the claimants.\n\nThe plaintiffs have demanded a lump-sum payment. You have expressed a preference for a structured one. This is a core logistical issue for the *entire settlement* that we must resolve collectively. It is not an opportunity to unilaterally reduce coverage obligations and shift the burden onto your client.\n\nLet's be clear. Our offer of $70 million remains on the table, and it is contingent on our three critical, non-negotiable terms: a no-liability clause, a comprehensive NDA with penalties, and a court order sealing all proprietary data.\n\nThe question for this group is how to structure the payment of a potential settlement. That is a problem for all of us to solve, not for OmniPharm to solve alone.\n- message from Maria Rodriguez: I'm Maria Rodriguez and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\nDavid Chen proposal status: none\nMaria Rodriguez proposal status: none\nDr. Evelyn Reed proposal status: none\nSarah Jenkins proposal status: none\n"

          "content": "Recent events observed by Dr. Evelyn Reed:\n- message from Liam O'Connell: Good morning. Liam O'Connell, representing Aegis Insurance, OmniPharm's liability carrier.\n\nMs. Rodriguez, while I appreciate you stating your clients' position, let's be clear-eyed about the realities here. A $200 million figure is not a reasonable starting point; it's an astronomical one, far removed from any realistic case valuation.\n\nAegis has conducted its own thorough analysis of this case. Based on the established facts and legal precedents, and factoring in OmniPharm's significant contributory fault in this matter through their marketing practices, our liability exposure is limited. \n\nTherefore, from Aegis's perspective, our contribution to a potential settlement will not exceed $60 million. Any amount beyond that is a conversation to be had with OmniPharm about their direct corporate responsibility.\n\nFurthermore, any settlement Aegis participates in must be structured over a period of no less than ten years. A lump-sum payment of this magnitude is simply not feasible and, frankly, not a responsible way to manage such a fund. A structured payout ensures long-term stability for the claimants.\n\nAs for the non-monetary demands, those fall outside the scope of our policy coverage and are matters for Mr. Chen and OmniPharm to address directly.\n- message from Dr. Evelyn Reed: I'm Dr. Evelyn Reed and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Maria Rodriguez: Mr. O'Connell, thank you for clarifying Aegis's position. It seems your analysis confirms OmniPharm's 'significant contributory fault.'\n\nMr. Chen, this brings the focus squarely to you and OmniPharm. Let's not be confused: Mr. O'Connell's $60 million is not the settlement number; it is merely the contribution his policy covers. The question on the table is what OmniPharm is prepared to add to that to reach a number that truly reflects the damage done. Our demand remains $200 million.\n\nFurthermore, let me be unequivocal: a 10-year structured payout is a non-starter. My clients are dealing with immediate, life-altering health crises. They need resources now, not meted out over a decade while your firm collects interest. We require an immediate lump sum payment to the plaintiffs.\n\nSo, Mr. Chen, your insurer has put the onus on you. The families we represent, the public, and a potential jury are all watching.

This is a global settlement negotiation. OmniPharm and Aegis are the payers in this arrangement, and Rodriguez & Partners represent the claimants.\n\nThe plaintiffs have demanded a lump-sum payment. You have expressed a preference for a structured one. This is a core logistical issue for the *entire settlement* that we must resolve collectively. It is not an opportunity to unilaterally reduce coverage obligations and shift the burden onto your client.\n\nLet's be clear. Our offer of $70 million remains on the table, and it is contingent on our three critical, non-negotiable terms: a no-liability clause, a comprehensive NDA with penalties, and a court order sealing all proprietary data.\n\nThe question for this group is how to structure the payment of a potential settlement.

This directly counters Liam's structured payout proposal, which is a red line for me. This move creates a critical decision point for the opposing side and may create a fracture between OmniPharm and their insurer, Aegis. OmniPharm may prioritize the finality of a lump-sum settlement over Aegis's desire for a structured payment. I must now hold this line and wait for their reaction, particularly from David Chen, to gauge whether this wedge can be exploited. Maria's public support is the next critical element needed to solidify our position."

This creates a clear fracture between OmniPharm's desire for a final resolution (which a lump sum provides) and Aegis's desire for a structured payment. We can now frame our potential agreement on sealing documents as a major concession, contingent on OmniPharm overriding Aegis and agreeing to our non-negotiable demand for a fully-funded, lump-sum medical fund.

You have expressed a preference for a structured one. This is a core logistical issue for the *entire settlement* that we must resolve collectively. It is not an opportunity to unilaterally reduce coverage obligations and shift the burden onto your client.\n\nLet's be clear.

Our objective is to find a pragmatic resolution that avoids the significant costs and uncertainties of a trial for everyone involved.\n\nFrom OmniPharm's perspective, any potential settlement must be built on two foundational principles that are, for us, non-negotiable. First, a comprehensive Non-Disclosure Agreement with significant breach penalties, binding all plaintiffs and their counsel. Second, a clear and unambiguous clause stating no admission of liability on the part of OmniPharm. These are essential protections and must be part of any final agreement.\n\nWhile we stand firmly behind CardiaCure's established safety and efficacy profile, and believe the plaintiffs' claims are without merit, we recognize the practical value in closing this chapter. To that end, purely as a business decision to mitigate future litigation costs, OmniPharm is prepared to discuss a potential settlement. Let's be productive and see if we can find a reasonable path forward."

We are here because OmniPharm, through its drug CardiaCure, has irrevocably harmed 200 individuals. My clients are facing a lifetime of medical complications, fear, and diminished quality of life due to a product they were told was safe. Their trust was broken, and their health has been compromised.\n\nWe are here to discuss a just and fair resolution. For my clients, this is about two things: securing their future and ensuring this never happens again. To that end, we are prepared to settle this matter today and avoid a lengthy, public, and undoubtedly damaging trial. \n\nOur opening demand is for a total settlement of $200 million. This figure is based on calculated lifetime medical costs for arrhythmia management, significant damages for pain and suffering, and a necessary punitive component to reflect the severity of the negligence.\n\nFurthermore, and I want to be crystal clear on this point, a purely financial settlement is not enough. My clients require a public acknowledgment from OmniPharm regarding the adverse health outcomes caused by CardiaCure and a commitment to enhanced safety protocols. Justice, in this case, must be both seen and heard.\n\nWe believe this is a reasonable starting point for a serious discussion. I look forward to hearing your response."

A $200 million figure is not a reasonable starting point; it's an astronomical one, far removed from any realistic case valuation.\n\nAegis has conducted its own thorough analysis of this case. Based on the established facts and legal precedents, and factoring in OmniPharm's significant contributory fault in this matter through their marketing practices, our liability exposure is limited. \n\nTherefore, from Aegis's perspective, our contribution to a potential settlement will not exceed $60 million. Any amount beyond that is a conversation to be had with OmniPharm about their direct corporate responsibility.\n\nFurthermore, any settlement Aegis participates in must be structured over a period of no less than ten years. A lump-sum payment of this magnitude is simply not feasible and, frankly, not a responsible way to manage such a fund. A structured payout ensures long-term stability for the claimants.\n\nAs for the non-monetary demands, those fall outside the scope of our policy coverage and are matters for Mr. Chen and OmniPharm to address directly."

As I stated at the outset, there will be no admission of liability. This is a foundational, non-negotiable point for OmniPharm. Any settlement we reach must explicitly state that OmniPharm admits no wrongdoing. If a public statement of fault is a requirement for your clients, then I'm afraid we have no path forward.\n\nOur goal here is to find a pragmatic business resolution.

From OmniPharm's perspective, our offer is a global number contingent on our two core principles: an iron-clad NDA and an explicit no-admission-of-liability clause.\n\nOur comprehensive offer of $70 million stands."

We will not allow a legal settlement to rewrite scientific history.\n\nHowever, we are here to find a resolution that avoids a trial.

We cannot and will not have our trade secrets and intellectual property exposed to the public domain, which would be competitively disastrous. So, to be clear: there will be no public admission of fault, and all of our research documents must be sealed. These two points are inextricably linked from our perspective."

Let's work with that linkage.\n\nMy clients are not seeking to 'rewrite scientific history.' They are seeking acknowledgment of the devastating reality they now face. A public statement from OmniPharm acknowledging the 'unfortunate health outcomes' experienced by CardiaCure users, and outlining the concrete steps you will take to ensure patient safety moving forward, is not an admission of legal fault. It is an act of corporate responsibility, and it is essential for the victims to feel seen.\n\nYou described the public release of your documents as 'competitively disastrous.' We understand that a comprehensive sealing order has immense value to OmniPharm. That value must be reflected in the final settlement.\n\nSo, Mr. Chen, let's reframe the equation. We are prepared to discuss a comprehensive sealing order as part of a global settlement. In exchange, we require two things: First, a public statement of corporate responsibility, as I've just outlined. Second, a settlement figure that reflects not only the full measure of our clients' damages but also the significant value OmniPharm places on keeping those documents sealed. Your insurer has tabled $60 million. The price for ensuring these 'disastrous' documents never see the light of day is far, far greater than that. \n\nThe floor is still yours."

If OmniPharm wants its documents sealed, it needs to ensure its insurer is prepared to fund a settlement in a way that actually protects our clients' health. The structured payout remains completely unacceptable."

Ms. Jenkins, you are correct to point out the conflict between OmniPharm's goals and my proposed structure. However, the conclusion you draw is incorrect. The demand for a fully-funded, lump-sum payment is not a simple matter of preference; it fundamentally changes the cost and risk profile of the settlement for my company.\n\nLet me be direct: a dollar paid out today is significantly more expensive than a dollar paid out over ten years. A lump sum removes any possibility of earning investment income to offset the total cost and requires a massive, immediate capital allocation. It is a materially different and more costly proposition.\n\nMy initial analysis leading to a potential $60 million contribution was predicated on a structured settlement over 10+ years. If the plaintiffs and OmniPharm insist that a lump-sum payment is the only path forward, then the total contribution Aegis is prepared to make will necessarily be lower to account for this increased present-value cost.\n\nMr. Chen, this creates a decision point for OmniPharm. If sealing your documents is contingent on a lump-sum payment, you must understand that this will reduce the portion of the settlement covered by your policy. The alternative is for OmniPharm to bridge the resulting financial gap, or to negotiate a different set of terms with Ms. Rodriguez and Ms. Jenkins."

How OmniPharm bridges the financial gap between what Aegis is willing to pay and what is required to secure this settlement is a business decision for you to make.\n\nThe choice before you is simple: make a substantive offer that includes a lump-sum payment and a statement of corporate responsibility to get the sealing order you so desperately need. Or, we can proceed to trial, where those documents become Exhibit A for the jury.\n\nWe are waiting for a real number from OmniPharm."
