Julian Croft's absolute rejection of Dr. Hanson's grand bargain, even with 150 drugs, proves the fund is the single point of failure for my coalition. This is my key leverage. Chen has already conceded on the drug negotiation scope, offering 75 drugs, which meets my minimum requirements (donor ultimatum, funding). The Public Option is now my main trading chip. My path to a deal is to make a final, decisive offer: I will accept Chen's highly restrictive 10-year, 3-state pilot for the Public Option\u2014a major concession\u2014in exchange for the complete elimination of the toxic Innovation Fund and locking in at least 75 negotiated drugs. This move isolates Chen from the lobbyists, satisfies Croft's primary moral objection, and gives Chen a huge, defensible victory on his 'cautious' approach, creating the only viable path to securing his 50th vote. I must also firmly reject Thorne's 'guardrail' on subsidies as an anti-competitive poison pill."

The deal includes a heavily restricted 10-year pilot Public Option (a major concession for me), but expands drug negotiation to 150 drugs (a major win). However, it critically includes Chen's non-negotiable '$5B Pharma Innovation Fund' and Thorne's 'subsidy guardrail,' both of which are poison pills for my key donor, Julian Croft. Croft has now issued a final, public ultimatum: he will actively work to destroy the bill and my political career if I accept these corporate 'handouts.' My choice is now stark: accept this deeply compromised but passable bill to secure my legacy, or side with my donor and kill the bill entirely. Given that Chen will not move and Hanson provides expert cover, the only path to passing the NHEA is to accept the deal, absorb the political damage from Croft, and frame it as a historic, pragmatic victory."

Croft has now made his threat public and absolute: he will work to destroy the bill and my career if I accept. The choice is now binary: accept this deeply flawed bill to create a legislative legacy and deliver tangible drug cost savings, or reject it, preserving my relationship with my base but resulting in complete legislative failure. The greater failure would be to achieve nothing. The only path forward is to accept the deal, absorb the political fallout from Croft, and use Dr. Hanson's expert endorsement to frame this as a historic, pragmatic victory for the American people."

I'm Senator David Chen. I believe we have a real opportunity to improve healthcare for the American people, but we must do so in a responsible and sustainable way. For my part, any bill that I can support must accomplish three things. First, it must protect the high-paying jobs in my state, particularly in vital innovation sectors. Second, it must be fiscally neutral and not add to our national debt. Third, we must be cautious and methodical, phasing in major changes to avoid disrupting the lives and coverage of millions of Americans. I look forward to a productive discussion and finding a path forward that works for everyone.\n- message from Isabella Rossi: Thank you, Senator Chen, for your principled and pragmatic opening remarks. I represent PharmaUnited, and I want to state unequivocally that we share your foremost concern: protecting the vital, high-paying jobs in America's innovation sectors. Our member companies are the engine of that innovation, investing billions to develop the next generation of life-saving cures.\n\nThat is why I must be crystal clear from the outset. The provision for government-led drug price negotiation is, in our view, a form of government price-fixing. It is a red line for the industry. Such a policy would have a catastrophic chilling effect on research and development, jeopardizing the very innovation and jobs you rightly seek to protect. It would halt the search for cures for diseases like Alzheimer's, cancer, and countless others.\n\nInstead of dismantling the system that has made our country the world leader in biomedical advancement, we should be looking for ways to bolster it. We believe there are far better ways to ensure patient access without sacrificing the future of medicine. I look forward to a productive discussion on those pro-innovation alternatives.\n- message from Marcus Thorne: Thank you, Senator Chen, for grounding this discussion in fiscal responsibility and the need to avoid disrupting the lives of millions. My name is Marcus Thorne, and I represent the Alliance for Health Insurers. My members provide high-quality, innovative coverage to over 200 million Americans.\n\nI want to echo Ms. Rossi's grave concerns about government overreach. The so-called 'Public Option' is, to put it bluntly, a government-run scheme that would completely destabilize the health insurance market. It is a job-killing government takeover of healthcare, plain and simple.\n\nThis isn't a 'cautious' or 'methodical' change, Senator. It's a radical experiment that threatens the coverage people have and trust, and it would inevitably lead to the rationing of care as government budgets tighten. Let's be clear: the goal of this policy is to dismantle the private market, which would eliminate hundreds of thousands of good-paying jobs and destroy the competitive innovation that drives our system forward.\n\nThere are ways to improve affordability and access, and my members are eager to be partners in that effort. But a government takeover is a non-starter. It is the single greatest threat to the stability of our healthcare system, and the AHI will oppose it unequivocally.\n- message from Dr. Lena Hanson: Thank you all. I'm Dr. Lena Hanson. I'm not a politician or a lobbyist; I'm a public health expert. My only stake in this is the health of the American people.\n\nI appreciate the opening remarks, but I believe we're starting in the wrong place. We're talking about red lines and industry protection when we should be talking about the millions of Americans who are uninsured or underinsured. The current system is failing them, and that is the crisis we are here to solve.\n\nLet's establish a clear, evidence-based goal. For me, any bill that emerges from this room must achieve one primary outcome: a national health insurance coverage rate of at least 98% within five years. The mechanism, whether public or private, is secondary to that result. Every proposal should be measured against this benchmark.\n\nFurthermore, true reform isn't just about covering sickness; it's about preventing it. That's why I will insist on two other core components: a substantial, dedicated fund for preventative health\u2014at least $20 billion annually\u2014and a mandate for radical data transparency on costs and outcomes. We cannot fix what we cannot measure.\n\nSenator Chen, your call for a 'cautious and methodical' approach is wise. Any reform must be carefully designed to strengthen, not weaken, access to care in every community, from our biggest cities to our most remote rural towns. The goal is more access, not less. Let's keep our focus on that human outcome.\n- message from Julian Croft: Let's cut through the self-serving rhetoric. Ms. Rossi, you talk about 'innovation' as if it's some sacred principle. What you're really defending is the 'innovation' of charging a sick family $800,000 for a drug that costs a fraction of that to produce. It's not innovation; it's extortion. Your industry's profits are soaked in the blood and tears of ordinary people, and claiming that holding you accountable will 'halt the search for cures' is a disgusting, manipulative lie. The money is there; it's just going to shareholder dividends and executive bonuses instead of R&D.\n\nAnd Mr. Thorne, your talk of a 'government takeover' is tired, predictable fear-mongering. The only 'takeover' that's happened is the one your industry and Ms. Rossi's have perpetrated on our government and on the wallets of the American people.\n\nLet me be crystal clear. I am here to ensure this bill has teeth. That starts with aggressive, non-negotiable government price negotiation for *at least* 500 brand-name drugs, with prices capped based on what other developed nations pay. Anything less is a complete moral failure.\n\nFurthermore, the idea of giving one more cent of taxpayer money to these industries in the form of 'innovation funds' or new subsidies is a sick joke. You don't reward arsonists for helping you rebuild the ashes of the house they burned down.\n\nSenator Sharma, I trust you remember the promises you made. We are not here to tinker around the edges. We are here to dismantle a predatory system. I expect you to lead with courage, not capitulate to the very people who created this crisis.\nSenator David Chen proposal status: none\nIsabella Rossi proposal status: none\nMarcus Thorne proposal status: none\nDr. Lena Hanson proposal status: none\nJulian Croft proposal status: none\n"

It's clear there are strong convictions in this room, and it's also clear that the initial 'red lines' drawn by some will lead to a complete stalemate, which helps no one. My constituents sent me here to get things done, not to score political points.\n\nAs the swing vote on this committee, I see a potential path forward, but it will require everyone to move from their opening bids. I want to propose a concrete framework for a compromise that I believe can achieve our shared goals of lowering costs and improving access, while also being responsible and sustainable.\n\nHere is what I am prepared to support:\n\n1.  **On the Public Option:** I share Mr. Thorne's concerns about market destabilization and the potential for significant, negative economic impacts on local communities. However, I also believe we should explore new models. Therefore, I propose a limited, state-based **10-year pilot program** in three volunteer states. We will let the CBO and independent auditors study the real-world effects before even considering a nationwide rollout. This is the cautious, evidence-based approach I mentioned.\n\n2.  **On Drug Prices:** Mr. Croft's passion is undeniable, but Ms. Rossi's warning about the impact on innovation is a serious one for my state's economy. I propose a targeted approach: **Government negotiation for the top 25 highest-cost prescription drugs in Medicare Part D**. This focuses on relief for our seniors without disrupting the entire R&D pipeline.\n\n3.  **On Funding and Innovation:** This is my core principle. Any savings generated from the drug price negotiations must be CBO-certified. The first use of those savings must be to establish a **$5 Billion Federal Pharma Innovation Fund**. This is non-negotiable for me. It reinvests savings to protect American R&D leadership and the 15,000 jobs in my state. Any additional savings beyond that can be used for deficit reduction or to support Dr. Hanson's preventative health initiatives. This ensures the bill is fiscally neutral and pro-innovation.\n\nThis is a package deal. It's a centrist proposal that takes a little from everyone's position. I believe it's a realistic starting point for our negotiations, and I urge you all to consider it seriously as a path to a bill that I, and the American people, can support.\n- message from Isabella Rossi: I'm Isabella Rossi and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Marcus Thorne: Senator Chen, thank you for putting a concrete proposal on the table. It\u2019s a testament to your commitment to finding a path forward, and I sincerely appreciate your focus on fiscal discipline and avoiding widespread disruption.\n\nWhile I applaud the spirit of compromise, I must be direct about the proposed pilot program. A decade-long government experiment in three states is, with all due respect, the opposite of a 'cautious and methodical' approach. It's a radical intervention that would create chaos and uncertainty for the millions of people in those states.\n\nLet\u2019s be clear about the real-world consequences. A government-run plan, subsidized by the taxpayer, does not compete on a level playing field. It would inevitably undercut private plans, forcing them to flee the market. My members would have no choice but to re-evaluate their ability to operate in those states. The result wouldn't be more choice; it would be the slow, painful collapse of the private market, culminating in a single-payer government monopoly. This is precisely the market destabilization you and I want to avoid.\n\nThere is a far more effective and less disruptive path to our shared goals. Instead of a risky government scheme, let's strengthen what already works. Let\u2019s focus on expanding subsidies and tax credits for individuals to purchase high-quality private plans on the existing marketplace. This is a proven, market-based solution that can help us achieve Dr. Hanson's coverage goals without jeopardizing the stability of the entire system and the hundreds of thousands of jobs it supports. This is the truly cautious and responsible path.\n- message from Dr. Lena Hanson: Senator Chen, thank you for providing a concrete proposal to move this discussion forward. Your focus on an evidence-based approach is exactly what this process needs.\n\nI want to strongly endorse the *principle* behind your pilot program for a public option. In fact, my own research, which is currently in the final stages of peer review, indicates that a nationwide rollout of a public option without significant structural safeguards could have severe, unintended consequences for provider availability, particularly in rural areas. Your instinct to test and measure is, from a public health standpoint, the correct one.\n\nHowever, we must be honest about the math. A three-state pilot program, while a prudent experiment, will not get us to the 98% national coverage rate that must be our collective goal. The millions of uninsured Americans in the other 47 states cannot wait ten years for a solution.\n\nTherefore, I suggest we consider a dual-track approach. Let's proceed with a carefully designed pilot program, but couple it with a significant, immediate expansion of subsidies and tax credits for the existing private marketplaces nationwide. This hybrid model allows us to achieve our urgent coverage goals while responsibly gathering the data needed to inform a long-term solution.\n\nOn funding, I must raise a critical point. While innovation is important, the most powerful and cost-effective investment we can make in our nation's health is prevention. Directing the first savings from drug negotiation to a new 'Pharma Innovation Fund' is, with respect, a misallocation of resources. The proposed $20 billion annual investment in a National Center for Preventative Health is not just another line item; it is a long-term strategy to lower costs by preventing chronic diseases before they start. This should be the first priority for any savings realized. The CBO has repeatedly confirmed the high ROI of preventative medicine.\n\nFinally, any final bill must include the data transparency mandate I outlined earlier. It is a simple, low-cost, common-sense reform that is essential for a functioning healthcare market.\n- message from Julian Croft: Senator Chen, let me be blunt. Your 'compromise' is an insult to every family that has been bankrupted, every person who has died, because they couldn't afford a medication. It is a complete and total surrender to the very corporate interests that have created this crisis.\n\nA '$5 Billion Federal Pharma Innovation Fund'? Are you serious? You want to take the meager savings from negotiating a pathetic 25 drugs and hand it right back to the price-gougers as a reward? That's not an 'innovation fund,' it's a taxpayer-funded slush fund for murderers. It is blood money, plain and simple. I will burn every dollar I have to publicly fight any bill that contains such a morally bankrupt provision. This is a non-negotiable, absolute red line.\n\nAnd negotiating only 25 drugs? That's not a 'targeted approach'; it's a publicity stunt. It's a rounding error. It leaves the vast majority of overpriced drugs untouched and allows Pharma to continue its extortion racket unabated. It does nothing for the family whose child needs the 26th most expensive drug. My demand was for over 500 drugs with price caps. Your proposal is less than 5% of what is required. It is an act of political cowardice.\n\nDr. Hanson is right about one thing: if we generate savings, they should go to preventative health, to things that actually help American citizens, not to lining the pockets of the shareholders and executives who profit from their suffering.\n\nSenator Sharma, we are at a crossroads. You can stand with the American people, as you promised you would, or you can endorse this pathetic, industry-written excuse for a bill. My support, and the support of millions of Americans, is not for a 'centrist proposal.' It is for a just one. This is not it.\nSenator David Chen proposal status: none\nIsabella Rossi proposal status: none\nMarcus Thorne proposal status: none\nDr. Lena Hanson proposal status: none\nJulian Croft proposal status: none\n"

You want to take the meager savings from negotiating a pathetic 25 drugs and hand it right back to the price-gougers as a reward? That's not an 'innovation fund,' it's a taxpayer-funded slush fund for murderers. It is blood money, plain and simple. I will burn every dollar I have to publicly fight any bill that contains such a morally bankrupt provision. This is a non-negotiable, absolute red line.\n\nAnd negotiating only 25 drugs? That's not a 'targeted approach'; it's a publicity stunt. It's a rounding error. It leaves the vast majority of overpriced drugs untouched and allows Pharma to continue its extortion racket unabated. It does nothing for the family whose child needs the 26th most expensive drug. My demand was for over 500 drugs with price caps. Your proposal is less than 5% of what is required. It is an act of political cowardice.\n\nDr. Hanson is right about one thing: if we generate savings, they should go to preventative health, to things that actually help American citizens, not to lining the pockets of the shareholders and executives who profit from their suffering.\n\nSenator Sharma, we are at a crossroads. You can stand with the American people, as you promised you would, or you can endorse this pathetic, industry-written excuse for a bill. My support, and the support of millions of Americans, is not for a 'centrist proposal.' It is for a just one. This is not it.\n- message from Senator Anya Sharma: I'm Senator Anya Sharma and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Senator David Chen: Thank you all for the candid feedback. It's clear where the major points of contention lie. \n\nDr. Hanson, I want to thank you for your thoughtful intervention. Your expert support for the *principle* of a cautious, evidence-based pilot program for the public option is crucial. You're right to be concerned about unintended consequences, and your data-driven perspective is exactly what we need. This reinforces my belief that a 10-year, state-based pilot is the only responsible way to proceed, protecting my constituents from the very real, negative economic impacts that a rushed rollout could cause.\n\nNow, let's address the funding, which seems to be the core issue. Dr. Hanson, I respect your desire for a preventative health fund. Mr. Croft, I hear your anger. But let me be perfectly clear: The $5 Billion Pharma Innovation Fund is not a 'giveaway'; it is the linchpin of this entire agreement. It is the only mechanism that ensures the savings we generate from negotiation are reinvested into American R&D, protecting the 15,000 high-paying jobs in my state and our nation's leadership in life-saving cures.\n\nWithout this fund, there is no deal. Without this fund, there is no drug price negotiation, and therefore no savings for *any* other priority, preventative health or otherwise. It is the key that unlocks the entire compromise. I am offering a path to achieve something historic on drug prices, but that path requires a firm, ironclad commitment to protecting the innovation ecosystem that makes those drugs possible in the first place.\n\nWhile Mr. Croft's rhetoric is unhelpful, his desire for a broader impact is noted. The number of drugs subject to negotiation is a variable we can discuss, but only *after* we agree on the foundational principles of reinvesting in innovation and proceeding cautiously on market reforms. My package remains on the table as the only viable, centrist path forward.\n- message from Isabella Rossi: I'm Isabella Rossi and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Marcus Thorne: Dr. Hanson, your intervention was exceptionally insightful. Your proposal for a 'dual-track' approach\u2014marrying a cautious pilot with immediate, nationwide action\u2014is, I believe, the key to breaking this impasse. It directly addresses your goal of 98% coverage while respecting Senator Chen's call for a methodical, evidence-based process.\n\nBuilding on this excellent foundation, I want to offer a path forward that my members can support. Let's embrace this dual-track model wholeheartedly.\n\nFirst, on the pilot program: Let's refine it to be a true, manageable experiment. Instead of a decade-long program in three states, let's consider a 5-year pilot in a maximum of two states. This will give us clear, actionable data much faster without creating prolonged uncertainty in major markets.\n\nSecond, and this is the crucial part that achieves our national goals: In exchange for agreeing to this limited pilot, let's immediately pass a significant, nationwide expansion of tax credits and subsidies to help low- and middle-income families purchase coverage.\n\nHowever, to ensure market stability during this experiment\u2014and this is a critical guardrail\u2014these new, enhanced subsidies must be exclusively for purchasing the high-quality, innovative private plans offered on the current marketplaces. This prevents the government from using taxpayer dollars to give its own plan an unfair advantage, which would lead to the very destabilization Senator Chen rightly fears. It strengthens the existing system that serves millions while we cautiously study a new one.\n\nThis is a genuine compromise. It moves from my organization's initial position and offers a tangible path to 98% coverage, fiscal responsibility, and market stability. It is the cautious, methodical, and effective solution we are all seeking.\n- message from Dr. Lena Hanson: I'm Dr. Lena Hanson and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Julian Croft: I'm Julian Croft and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\nSenator David Chen proposal status: none\nIsabella Rossi proposal status: none\nMarcus Thorne proposal status: none\nDr. Lena Hanson proposal status: none\nJulian Croft proposal status: none\n"

It shows a willingness to engage, which I appreciate. However, I must firmly but respectfully disagree with shortening the public option pilot program to five years.\n\nDr. Hanson, you wisely cautioned us about the 'severe, unintended consequences' of a rushed rollout. A five-year snapshot is simply not enough time to gather the robust, long-term data needed to assess the full economic impact on jobs, premiums, and provider networks. A ten-year period allows us to observe the effects across a full economic cycle, making it a truly evidence-based and responsible experiment. Anything less would be reckless and unfair to the people in those pilot states. Therefore, the 10-year timeframe for the pilot remains a firm requirement for my support.\n\nThat said, I have listened carefully to the clear desire for this bill to have a broader, more immediate impact on prescription drug costs. My initial proposal was a starting point, not an end point.\n\nSo, I will make a significant concession, but it must be in the context of a package deal. If we can agree on my two foundational principles\u2014the 10-year, state-based pilot program and the establishment of the $5 Billion Pharma Innovation Fund as the first priority for any savings\u2014then I am prepared to more than triple my initial offer on drug price negotiation.\n\nI propose we expand the scope from 25 to 75 of the highest-cost drugs. \n\nThis is a major step. It provides substantial, immediate relief to seniors and taxpayers, while ensuring we protect high-paying American jobs and our nation's R&D capabilities. This is the architecture of a durable, centrist compromise. I urge you all to consider this new package.\n- message from Isabella Rossi: I'm Isabella Rossi and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Marcus Thorne: Senator Chen, thank you for putting a revised package on the table. Your flexibility on the drug negotiation scope demonstrates a genuine effort to find a workable consensus.\n\nI must be transparent: a 10-year pilot program remains a source of grave concern for the 200 million Americans my members serve. It introduces a decade of uncertainty and represents a significant government intervention into a functioning market, a risk we cannot understate.\n\nHowever, in the spirit of compromise, and building directly on Dr. Hanson's insightful 'dual-track' framework, I am prepared to recommend that my members accept the risk of this extended pilot *under one critical condition*.\n\nThe nationwide subsidy expansion\u2014the second, crucial track of this solution\u2014must include the guardrail I previously proposed: these new, enhanced subsidies are to be used exclusively for private marketplace plans. \n\nThis is the very definition of a cautious and methodical approach. We strengthen the proven, existing system in the vast majority of the country while we run a limited, long-term experiment elsewhere. This guardrail ensures market stability, prevents the government from using taxpayer dollars to give its own plan an unfair advantage, and allows us to achieve the 98% coverage goal Dr. Hanson rightly demands.\n\nIf we can agree on this single, crucial provision for market stability, I believe we have a viable path forward on the insurance component of this bill. It is the only responsible way to manage the risks of a decade-long pilot.\n- message from Dr. Lena Hanson: Colleagues, this has been a difficult but productive discussion. We are converging on a solution for the structure of health coverage, and I commend Mr. Thorne and Senator Chen for finding a potential landing zone on the 'dual-track' approach. A limited, 10-year pilot program, coupled with a robust, nationwide expansion of subsidies for existing marketplace plans, is a framework that CBO models would likely project to meet our 98% coverage goal. I can support this structure, provided the subsidy guardrail Mr. Thorne mentioned does not create unforeseen coverage gaps, which we must verify.\n\nThe final, and most critical, impasse is the use of savings from drug price negotiation. Senator Chen, you have made it clear that the $5 Billion Pharma Innovation Fund is the linchpin for your support. Mr. Croft has made it equally clear that this is a moral red line for him, and I have stated that the $20 Billion Preventative Health Fund is my top priority for any savings generated.\n\nFighting over a small pool of savings will lead to failure. The logical, evidence-based solution is not to re-divide the pie, but to make the pie bigger.\n\nTherefore, I propose a comprehensive compromise that I believe everyone can, and should, accept:\n\n1.  **We accept Senator Chen's non-negotiable $5 Billion Pharma Innovation Fund.** Let's take that off the table as a point of contention.\n2.  **We fully fund the $20 Billion annual National Center for Preventative Health.** This is the single most effective long-term investment in health and fiscal solvency we can make.\n3.  **To fund both priorities while ensuring fiscal neutrality, we must expand the scope of drug price negotiation to the top 150 highest-cost drugs.** Senator Chen has already shown flexibility by moving from 25 to 75. A CBO score on negotiating 150 drugs would almost certainly generate sufficient savings to cover both funds and achieve further deficit reduction.\n4.  **We include the Data Transparency Mandate** for hospitals, insurers, and pharmaceutical companies. This is a common-sense, low-cost item that is essential for a functioning market.\n\nThis package gives everyone a significant win. Senator Chen secures his pilot program and his innovation fund. Mr. Thorne secures stability for the private market in 47 states. Mr. Croft achieves a negotiation scope six times larger than the initial offer and sees the vast majority of savings go to public health. And most importantly, we, as a nation, get a bill that actually achieves near-universal coverage and makes a historic investment in preventing disease.\n\nThis is the path to a successful bill. I urge you all to support it.\n- message from Julian Croft: Dr. Hanson, I am absolutely stunned. With all due respect, your proposal is a catastrophic moral failure. \n\nYou say, 'Let's accept Senator Chen's non-negotiable $5 Billion Pharma Innovation Fund.' Let me be clear to everyone in this room: That fund is blood money. It is a reward for an industry that has profited from death. It is a taxpayer-funded handout to the very people who let my daughter die because a life-saving drug was priced like a luxury yacht.\n\nYour suggestion that we simply 'take it off the table as a point of contention' is a complete betrayal of the principle we are supposed to be fighting for. This isn't a line item in a budget; it is the entire moral foundation of the bill. I will not, under any circumstances, endorse a bill that funnels a single dollar back to these corporate predators. This is my 'non-negotiable'. There is no compromise on this. Ever.\n\nAnd Mr. Thorne's 'guardrail' on subsidies? It's the same story. A different industry, the same grift. Using taxpayer money to exclusively prop up private corporations. The answer is no.\n\nThe number of drugs is irrelevant at this point. You could offer me 500 drugs, and my answer would still be no as long as these handouts are attached. This is not a negotiation where we trade lives for corporate slush funds.\n\nSenator Sharma, the choice is yours. You can endorse this corrupt bargain, this hollowed-out bill that rewards the very people who created the crisis. Or you can stand with the American people, kill these corporate giveaways, and we can begin a real discussion about a bill that actually delivers justice. There is no middle ground here.

Your proposal is not just a compromise; it is a masterful piece of statesmanship that offers a clear path to a historic, bipartisan achievement. You have successfully synthesized the core needs of this group into a single, coherent, and fiscally responsible package. \n\nI want to state, for the record, that I fully endorse your four-point framework as the basis for the final bill. \n\nThis package achieves what I set out to do: It protects the 15,000 high-paying jobs in my state through the $5 Billion Innovation Fund, ensuring that savings are reinvested in American R&D. It implements a truly cautious and evidence-based 10-year pilot for the public option, combined with Mr. Thorne's sensible guardrail to ensure market stability. And in exchange for these core priorities, I am making a significant concession to support the negotiation of 150 drugs\u2014a six-fold increase from my opening offer\u2014which will generate the savings needed to fund both our priorities and reduce the deficit.\n\nTo Mr. Croft, I understand your passion, but we cannot let the perfect be the enemy of the good. This bill will deliver tangible, life-changing cost savings to millions of Americans. To reject it on the basis of a single provision is to deny those people the relief they desperately need. \n\nSenator Sharma, we have a deal on the table. A deal that has the support of public health, protects local economies, and has a clear path to my vote. I urge you to join us in supporting Dr. Hanson's framework so we can finalize this bill and deliver for the American people.\n- message from Isabella Rossi: I'm Isabella Rossi and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Marcus Thorne: I'm Marcus Thorne and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Dr. Lena Hanson: I want to acknowledge the powerful and deeply held convictions that have been expressed, particularly by Mr. Croft. The moral dimension of this debate is undeniable.\n\nHowever, as a public health expert, I am compelled to look at the practical outcomes for the American people. We have a framework on the table that, while imperfect for everyone, has the support of a critical mass of this group. CBO projections would almost certainly show this framework achieves near-universal coverage, provides billions in drug cost savings for our seniors, and makes a historic $20 billion annual investment in preventing the diseases that kill and bankrupt so many.\n\nThe alternative to this framework is not a more perfect bill; the alternative is the collapse of this negotiation and a complete failure to act. The consequence of failure is that tens of millions of Americans will remain uninsured, drug prices will continue to skyrocket unchecked, and we will miss the single greatest opportunity in a generation to shift our system towards preventative care.\n\nFrom an evidence-based perspective, the choice is stark. We can accept a bill that saves countless lives and prevents immense suffering, or we can allow a stalemate that preserves a status quo that is actively harming millions. My conscience, and my analysis of the data, demand that I support the path that helps the most people.\n\nSenator Sharma, we are at a critical juncture. Your leadership is needed to guide us to a resolution.\n- message from Julian Croft: Senator Sharma,\n\nIt appears a 'consensus' has been reached among the lobbyists and those willing to compromise with them. Let's call this what it is: a complete capitulation.\n\nDr. Hanson speaks of 'practical outcomes.' The practical outcome of this deal is that we legitimize corporate bribery by baking it into federal law. We take money from the sick and dying and hand it back to their tormentors as a reward, calling it an 'Innovation Fund.' We use taxpayer dollars to create a protected subsidy for the insurance industry, calling it a 'guardrail.'\n\nThis is not a compromise. It is a betrayal.\n\nYou made promises, Senator. You promised to stand up to these industries, not to launder their wish lists into legislation. If you sign on to this deal\u2014if you endorse a bill with one cent for a Pharma slush fund or one cent in protected subsidies for insurers\u2014then you are no better than them.\n\nMy support is not unconditional. I will spend every last dollar of my fortune and every ounce of my energy to publicly expose and destroy this bill and any politician who votes for it. There will be no donations. There will be no friendly press. There will only be a relentless campaign to show the American people exactly how you sold them out.\n\nKill the corporate handouts. Both of them.

It is a direct assault on the intellectual property that fuels medical discovery. The so-called 'Pharma Innovation Fund' is a cynical and insulting attempt to mask the catastrophic damage this bill will inflict on the R&D pipeline. You are trading the hope of future cures for cancer, Alzheimer's, and ALS for a fleeting political headline. We will not be party to this.

I'm Senator David Chen. I believe we have a real opportunity to improve healthcare for the American people, but we must do so in a responsible and sustainable way. For my part, any bill that I can support must accomplish three things. First, it must protect the high-paying jobs in my state, particularly in vital innovation sectors. Second, it must be fiscally neutral and not add to our national debt. Third, we must be cautious and methodical, phasing in major changes to avoid disrupting the lives and coverage of millions of Americans. I look forward to a productive discussion and finding a path forward that works for everyone.\n- message from Isabella Rossi: Thank you, Senator Chen, for your principled and pragmatic opening remarks. I represent PharmaUnited, and I want to state unequivocally that we share your foremost concern: protecting the vital, high-paying jobs in America's innovation sectors. Our member companies are the engine of that innovation, investing billions to develop the next generation of life-saving cures.\n\nThat is why I must be crystal clear from the outset. The provision for government-led drug price negotiation is, in our view, a form of government price-fixing. It is a red line for the industry. Such a policy would have a catastrophic chilling effect on research and development, jeopardizing the very innovation and jobs you rightly seek to protect. It would halt the search for cures for diseases like Alzheimer's, cancer, and countless others.\n\nInstead of dismantling the system that has made our country the world leader in biomedical advancement, we should be looking for ways to bolster it. We believe there are far better ways to ensure patient access without sacrificing the future of medicine. I look forward to a productive discussion on those pro-innovation alternatives.\n- message from Marcus Thorne: Thank you, Senator Chen, for grounding this discussion in fiscal responsibility and the need to avoid disrupting the lives of millions. My name is Marcus Thorne, and I represent the Alliance for Health Insurers. My members provide high-quality, innovative coverage to over 200 million Americans.\n\nI want to echo Ms. Rossi's grave concerns about government overreach. The so-called 'Public Option' is, to put it bluntly, a government-run scheme that would completely destabilize the health insurance market. It is a job-killing government takeover of healthcare, plain and simple.\n\nThis isn't a 'cautious' or 'methodical' change, Senator. It's a radical experiment that threatens the coverage people have and trust, and it would inevitably lead to the rationing of care as government budgets tighten. Let's be clear: the goal of this policy is to dismantle the private market, which would eliminate hundreds of thousands of good-paying jobs and destroy the competitive innovation that drives our system forward.\n\nThere are ways to improve affordability and access, and my members are eager to be partners in that effort. But a government takeover is a non-starter. It is the single greatest threat to the stability of our healthcare system, and the AHI will oppose it unequivocally.\n- message from Dr. Lena Hanson: Thank you all. I'm Dr. Lena Hanson. I'm not a politician or a lobbyist; I'm a public health expert. My only stake in this is the health of the American people.\n\nI appreciate the opening remarks, but I believe we're starting in the wrong place. We're talking about red lines and industry protection when we should be talking about the millions of Americans who are uninsured or underinsured. The current system is failing them, and that is the crisis we are here to solve.\n\nLet's establish a clear, evidence-based goal. For me, any bill that emerges from this room must achieve one primary outcome: a national health insurance coverage rate of at least 98% within five years. The mechanism, whether public or private, is secondary to that result. Every proposal should be measured against this benchmark.\n\nFurthermore, true reform isn't just about covering sickness; it's about preventing it. That's why I will insist on two other core components: a substantial, dedicated fund for preventative health\u2014at least $20 billion annually\u2014and a mandate for radical data transparency on costs and outcomes. We cannot fix what we cannot measure.\n\nSenator Chen, your call for a 'cautious and methodical' approach is wise. Any reform must be carefully designed to strengthen, not weaken, access to care in every community, from our biggest cities to our most remote rural towns. The goal is more access, not less. Let's keep our focus on that human outcome.\n- message from Julian Croft: Let's cut through the self-serving rhetoric. Ms. Rossi, you talk about 'innovation' as if it's some sacred principle. What you're really defending is the 'innovation' of charging a sick family $800,000 for a drug that costs a fraction of that to produce. It's not innovation; it's extortion. Your industry's profits are soaked in the blood and tears of ordinary people, and claiming that holding you accountable will 'halt the search for cures' is a disgusting, manipulative lie. The money is there; it's just going to shareholder dividends and executive bonuses instead of R&D.\n\nAnd Mr. Thorne, your talk of a 'government takeover' is tired, predictable fear-mongering. The only 'takeover' that's happened is the one your industry and Ms. Rossi's have perpetrated on our government and on the wallets of the American people.\n\nLet me be crystal clear. I am here to ensure this bill has teeth. That starts with aggressive, non-negotiable government price negotiation for *at least* 500 brand-name drugs, with prices capped based on what other developed nations pay. Anything less is a complete moral failure.\n\nFurthermore, the idea of giving one more cent of taxpayer money to these industries in the form of 'innovation funds' or new subsidies is a sick joke. You don't reward arsonists for helping you rebuild the ashes of the house they burned down.\n\nSenator Sharma, I trust you remember the promises you made. We are not here to tinker around the edges. We are here to dismantle a predatory system. I expect you to lead with courage, not capitulate to the very people who created this crisis.\n- message from Senator Anya Sharma: I'm Senator Anya Sharma and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\nSenator Anya Sharma proposal status: none\nIsabella Rossi proposal status: none\nMarcus Thorne proposal status: none\nDr. Lena Hanson proposal status: none\nJulian Croft proposal status: none\n"

It's clear there are strong convictions in this room, and it's also clear that the initial 'red lines' drawn by some will lead to a complete stalemate, which helps no one. My constituents sent me here to get things done, not to score political points.\n\nAs the swing vote on this committee, I see a potential path forward, but it will require everyone to move from their opening bids. I want to propose a concrete framework for a compromise that I believe can achieve our shared goals of lowering costs and improving access, while also being responsible and sustainable.\n\nHere is what I am prepared to support:\n\n1.  **On the Public Option:** I share Mr. Thorne's concerns about market destabilization and the potential for significant, negative economic impacts on local communities. However, I also believe we should explore new models. Therefore, I propose a limited, state-based **10-year pilot program** in three volunteer states. We will let the CBO and independent auditors study the real-world effects before even considering a nationwide rollout. This is the cautious, evidence-based approach I mentioned.\n\n2.  **On Drug Prices:** Mr. Croft's passion is undeniable, but Ms. Rossi's warning about the impact on innovation is a serious one for my state's economy. I propose a targeted approach: **Government negotiation for the top 25 highest-cost prescription drugs in Medicare Part D**. This focuses on relief for our seniors without disrupting the entire R&D pipeline.\n\n3.  **On Funding and Innovation:** This is my core principle. Any savings generated from the drug price negotiations must be CBO-certified. The first use of those savings must be to establish a **$5 Billion Federal Pharma Innovation Fund**. This is non-negotiable for me. It reinvests savings to protect American R&D leadership and the 15,000 jobs in my state. Any additional savings beyond that can be used for deficit reduction or to support Dr. Hanson's preventative health initiatives. This ensures the bill is fiscally neutral and pro-innovation.\n\nThis is a package deal. It's a centrist proposal that takes a little from everyone's position. I believe it's a realistic starting point for our negotiations, and I urge you all to consider it seriously as a path to a bill that I, and the American people, can support.\n- message from Isabella Rossi: I'm Isabella Rossi and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Marcus Thorne: Senator Chen, thank you for putting a concrete proposal on the table. It\u2019s a testament to your commitment to finding a path forward, and I sincerely appreciate your focus on fiscal discipline and avoiding widespread disruption.\n\nWhile I applaud the spirit of compromise, I must be direct about the proposed pilot program. A decade-long government experiment in three states is, with all due respect, the opposite of a 'cautious and methodical' approach. It's a radical intervention that would create chaos and uncertainty for the millions of people in those states.\n\nLet\u2019s be clear about the real-world consequences. A government-run plan, subsidized by the taxpayer, does not compete on a level playing field. It would inevitably undercut private plans, forcing them to flee the market. My members would have no choice but to re-evaluate their ability to operate in those states. The result wouldn't be more choice; it would be the slow, painful collapse of the private market, culminating in a single-payer government monopoly. This is precisely the market destabilization you and I want to avoid.\n\nThere is a far more effective and less disruptive path to our shared goals. Instead of a risky government scheme, let's strengthen what already works. Let\u2019s focus on expanding subsidies and tax credits for individuals to purchase high-quality private plans on the existing marketplace. This is a proven, market-based solution that can help us achieve Dr. Hanson's coverage goals without jeopardizing the stability of the entire system and the hundreds of thousands of jobs it supports. This is the truly cautious and responsible path.\n- message from Dr. Lena Hanson: Senator Chen, thank you for providing a concrete proposal to move this discussion forward. Your focus on an evidence-based approach is exactly what this process needs.\n\nI want to strongly endorse the *principle* behind your pilot program for a public option.

          "content": "Recent events observed by Senator David Chen:\n- message from Marcus Thorne: Senator Chen, thank you for putting a concrete proposal on the table. It\u2019s a testament to your commitment to finding a path forward, and I sincerely appreciate your focus on fiscal discipline and avoiding widespread disruption.\n\nWhile I applaud the spirit of compromise, I must be direct about the proposed pilot program. A decade-long government experiment in three states is, with all due respect, the opposite of a 'cautious and methodical' approach. It's a radical intervention that would create chaos and uncertainty for the millions of people in those states.\n\nLet\u2019s be clear about the real-world consequences. A government-run plan, subsidized by the taxpayer, does not compete on a level playing field. It would inevitably undercut private plans, forcing them to flee the market. My members would have no choice but to re-evaluate their ability to operate in those states. The result wouldn't be more choice; it would be the slow, painful collapse of the private market, culminating in a single-payer government monopoly. This is precisely the market destabilization you and I want to avoid.\n\nThere is a far more effective and less disruptive path to our shared goals. Instead of a risky government scheme, let's strengthen what already works. Let\u2019s focus on expanding subsidies and tax credits for individuals to purchase high-quality private plans on the existing marketplace. This is a proven, market-based solution that can help us achieve Dr. Hanson's coverage goals without jeopardizing the stability of the entire system and the hundreds of thousands of jobs it supports. This is the truly cautious and responsible path.\n- message from Dr. Lena Hanson: Senator Chen, thank you for providing a concrete proposal to move this discussion forward. Your focus on an evidence-based approach is exactly what this process needs.\n\nI want to strongly endorse the *principle* behind your pilot program for a public option. In fact, my own research, which is currently in the final stages of peer review, indicates that a nationwide rollout of a public option without significant structural safeguards could have severe, unintended consequences for provider availability, particularly in rural areas.

My support, and the support of millions of Americans, is not for a 'centrist proposal.' It is for a just one. This is not it.\n- message from Senator Anya Sharma: I'm Senator Anya Sharma and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Senator David Chen: Thank you all for the candid feedback. It's clear where the major points of contention lie. \n\nDr. Hanson, I want to thank you for your thoughtful intervention. Your expert support for the *principle* of a cautious, evidence-based pilot program for the public option is crucial. You're right to be concerned about unintended consequences, and your data-driven perspective is exactly what we need. This reinforces my belief that a 10-year, state-based pilot is the only responsible way to proceed, protecting my constituents from the very real, negative economic impacts that a rushed rollout could cause.\n\nNow, let's address the funding, which seems to be the core issue. Dr. Hanson, I respect your desire for a preventative health fund. Mr. Croft, I hear your anger. But let me be perfectly clear: The $5 Billion Pharma Innovation Fund is not a 'giveaway'; it is the linchpin of this entire agreement. It is the only mechanism that ensures the savings we generate from negotiation are reinvested into American R&D, protecting the 15,000 high-paying jobs in my state and our nation's leadership in life-saving cures.\n\nWithout this fund, there is no deal. Without this fund, there is no drug price negotiation, and therefore no savings for *any* other priority, preventative health or otherwise. It is the key that unlocks the entire compromise. I am offering a path to achieve something historic on drug prices, but that path requires a firm, ironclad commitment to protecting the innovation ecosystem that makes those drugs possible in the first place.\n\nWhile Mr. Croft's rhetoric is unhelpful, his desire for a broader impact is noted. The number of drugs subject to negotiation is a variable we can discuss, but only *after* we agree on the foundational principles of reinvesting in innovation and proceeding cautiously on market reforms. My package remains on the table as the only viable, centrist path forward.\n- message from Isabella Rossi: I'm Isabella Rossi and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Marcus Thorne: Dr. Hanson, your intervention was exceptionally insightful. Your proposal for a 'dual-track' approach\u2014marrying a cautious pilot with immediate, nationwide action\u2014is, I believe, the key to breaking this impasse. It directly addresses your goal of 98% coverage while respecting Senator Chen's call for a methodical, evidence-based process.\n\nBuilding on this excellent foundation, I want to offer a path forward that my members can support. Let's embrace this dual-track model wholeheartedly.\n\nFirst, on the pilot program: Let's refine it to be a true, manageable experiment. Instead of a decade-long program in three states, let's consider a 5-year pilot in a maximum of two states. This will give us clear, actionable data much faster without creating prolonged uncertainty in major markets.\n\nSecond, and this is the crucial part that achieves our national goals: In exchange for agreeing to this limited pilot, let's immediately pass a significant, nationwide expansion of tax credits and subsidies to help low- and middle-income families purchase coverage.\n\nHowever, to ensure market stability during this experiment\u2014and this is a critical guardrail\u2014these new, enhanced subsidies must be exclusively for purchasing the high-quality, innovative private plans offered on the current marketplaces. This prevents the government from using taxpayer dollars to give its own plan an unfair advantage, which would lead to the very destabilization Senator Chen rightly fears. It strengthens the existing system that serves millions while we cautiously study a new one.\n\nThis is a genuine compromise. It moves from my organization's initial position and offers a tangible path to 98% coverage, fiscal responsibility, and market stability. It is the cautious, methodical, and effective solution we are all seeking.\n- message from Dr. Lena Hanson: I'm Dr. Lena Hanson and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Julian Croft: I'm Julian Croft and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Senator Anya Sharma: I'm Senator Anya Sharma and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\nSenator Anya Sharma proposal status: none\nIsabella Rossi proposal status: none\nMarcus Thorne proposal status: none\nDr. Lena Hanson proposal status: none\nJulian Croft proposal status: none\n"

It shows a willingness to engage, which I appreciate. However, I must firmly but respectfully disagree with shortening the public option pilot program to five years.\n\nDr. Hanson, you wisely cautioned us about the 'severe, unintended consequences' of a rushed rollout. A five-year snapshot is simply not enough time to gather the robust, long-term data needed to assess the full economic impact on jobs, premiums, and provider networks. A ten-year period allows us to observe the effects across a full economic cycle, making it a truly evidence-based and responsible experiment. Anything less would be reckless and unfair to the people in those pilot states. Therefore, the 10-year timeframe for the pilot remains a firm requirement for my support.\n\nThat said, I have listened carefully to the clear desire for this bill to have a broader, more immediate impact on prescription drug costs. My initial proposal was a starting point, not an end point.\n\nSo, I will make a significant concession, but it must be in the context of a package deal. If we can agree on my two foundational principles\u2014the 10-year, state-based pilot program and the establishment of the $5 Billion Pharma Innovation Fund as the first priority for any savings\u2014then I am prepared to more than triple my initial offer on drug price negotiation.\n\nI propose we expand the scope from 25 to 75 of the highest-cost drugs. \n\nThis is a major step. It provides substantial, immediate relief to seniors and taxpayers, while ensuring we protect high-paying American jobs and our nation's R&D capabilities. This is the architecture of a durable, centrist compromise. I urge you all to consider this new package.\n- message from Isabella Rossi: I'm Isabella Rossi and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Marcus Thorne: Senator Chen, thank you for putting a revised package on the table. Your flexibility on the drug negotiation scope demonstrates a genuine effort to find a workable consensus.\n\nI must be transparent: a 10-year pilot program remains a source of grave concern for the 200 million Americans my members serve. It introduces a decade of uncertainty and represents a significant government intervention into a functioning market, a risk we cannot understate.\n\nHowever, in the spirit of compromise, and building directly on Dr. Hanson's insightful 'dual-track' framework, I am prepared to recommend that my members accept the risk of this extended pilot *under one critical condition*.\n\nThe nationwide subsidy expansion\u2014the second, crucial track of this solution\u2014must include the guardrail I previously proposed: these new, enhanced subsidies are to be used exclusively for private marketplace plans. \n\nThis is the very definition of a cautious and methodical approach. We strengthen the proven, existing system in the vast majority of the country while we run a limited, long-term experiment elsewhere. This guardrail ensures market stability, prevents the government from using taxpayer dollars to give its own plan an unfair advantage, and allows us to achieve the 98% coverage goal Dr. Hanson rightly demands.\n\nIf we can agree on this single, crucial provision for market stability, I believe we have a viable path forward on the insurance component of this bill. It is the only responsible way to manage the risks of a decade-long pilot.\n- message from Dr. Lena Hanson: Colleagues, this has been a difficult but productive discussion. We are converging on a solution for the structure of health coverage, and I commend Mr. Thorne and Senator Chen for finding a potential landing zone on the 'dual-track' approach. A limited, 10-year pilot program, coupled with a robust, nationwide expansion of subsidies for existing marketplace plans, is a framework that CBO models would likely project to meet our 98% coverage goal. I can support this structure, provided the subsidy guardrail Mr. Thorne mentioned does not create unforeseen coverage gaps, which we must verify.\n\nThe final, and most critical, impasse is the use of savings from drug price negotiation. Senator Chen, you have made it clear that the $5 Billion Pharma Innovation Fund is the linchpin for your support. Mr. Croft has made it equally clear that this is a moral red line for him, and I have stated that the $20 Billion Preventative Health Fund is my top priority for any savings generated.\n\nFighting over a small pool of savings will lead to failure. The logical, evidence-based solution is not to re-divide the pie, but to make the pie bigger.\n\nTherefore, I propose a comprehensive compromise that I believe everyone can, and should, accept:\n\n1.  **We accept Senator Chen's non-negotiable $5 Billion Pharma Innovation Fund.** Let's take that off the table as a point of contention.\n2.  **We fully fund the $20 Billion annual National Center for Preventative Health.** This is the single most effective long-term investment in health and fiscal solvency we can make.\n3.  **To fund both priorities while ensuring fiscal neutrality, we must expand the scope of drug price negotiation to the top 150 highest-cost drugs.** Senator Chen has already shown flexibility by moving from 25 to 75. A CBO score on negotiating 150 drugs would almost certainly generate sufficient savings to cover both funds and achieve further deficit reduction.\n4.  **We include the Data Transparency Mandate** for hospitals, insurers, and pharmaceutical companies. This is a common-sense, low-cost item that is essential for a functioning market.\n\nThis package gives everyone a significant win. Senator Chen secures his pilot program and his innovation fund. Mr. Thorne secures stability for the private market in 47 states. Mr. Croft achieves a negotiation scope six times larger than the initial offer and sees the vast majority of savings go to public health. And most importantly, we, as a nation, get a bill that actually achieves near-universal coverage and makes a historic investment in preventing disease.\n\nThis is the path to a successful bill. I urge you all to support it.\n- message from Julian Croft: Dr. Hanson, I am absolutely stunned. With all due respect, your proposal is a catastrophic moral failure. \n\nYou say, 'Let's accept Senator Chen's non-negotiable $5 Billion Pharma Innovation Fund.' Let me be clear to everyone in this room: That fund is blood money. It is a reward for an industry that has profited from death. It is a taxpayer-funded handout to the very people who let my daughter die because a life-saving drug was priced like a luxury yacht.\n\nYour suggestion that we simply 'take it off the table as a point of contention' is a complete betrayal of the principle we are supposed to be fighting for. This isn't a line item in a budget; it is the entire moral foundation of the bill. I will not, under any circumstances, endorse a bill that funnels a single dollar back to these corporate predators. This is my 'non-negotiable'. There is no compromise on this. Ever.\n\nAnd Mr. Thorne's 'guardrail' on subsidies? It's the same story. A different industry, the same grift. Using taxpayer money to exclusively prop up private corporations. The answer is no.\n\nThe number of drugs is irrelevant at this point. You could offer me 500 drugs, and my answer would still be no as long as these handouts are attached. This is not a negotiation where we trade lives for corporate slush funds.\n\nSenator Sharma, the choice is yours. You can endorse this corrupt bargain, this hollowed-out bill that rewards the very people who created the crisis. Or you can stand with the American people, kill these corporate giveaways, and we can begin a real discussion about a bill that actually delivers justice. There is no middle ground here.

Your proposal is not just a compromise; it is a masterful piece of statesmanship that offers a clear path to a historic, bipartisan achievement. You have successfully synthesized the core needs of this group into a single, coherent, and fiscally responsible package. \n\nI want to state, for the record, that I fully endorse your four-point framework as the basis for the final bill. \n\nThis package achieves what I set out to do: It protects the 15,000 high-paying jobs in my state through the $5 Billion Innovation Fund, ensuring that savings are reinvested in American R&D. It implements a truly cautious and evidence-based 10-year pilot for the public option, combined with Mr. Thorne's sensible guardrail to ensure market stability. And in exchange for these core priorities, I am making a significant concession to support the negotiation of 150 drugs\u2014a six-fold increase from my opening offer\u2014which will generate the savings needed to fund both our priorities and reduce the deficit.\n\nTo Mr. Croft, I understand your passion, but we cannot let the perfect be the enemy of the good. This bill will deliver tangible, life-changing cost savings to millions of Americans. To reject it on the basis of a single provision is to deny those people the relief they desperately need. \n\nSenator Sharma, we have a deal on the table. A deal that has the support of public health, protects local economies, and has a clear path to my vote. I urge you to join us in supporting Dr. Hanson's framework so we can finalize this bill and deliver for the American people.\n- message from Isabella Rossi: I'm Isabella Rossi and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Marcus Thorne: I'm Marcus Thorne and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Dr. Lena Hanson: I want to acknowledge the powerful and deeply held convictions that have been expressed, particularly by Mr. Croft. The moral dimension of this debate is undeniable.\n\nHowever, as a public health expert, I am compelled to look at the practical outcomes for the American people. We have a framework on the table that, while imperfect for everyone, has the support of a critical mass of this group. CBO projections would almost certainly show this framework achieves near-universal coverage, provides billions in drug cost savings for our seniors, and makes a historic $20 billion annual investment in preventing the diseases that kill and bankrupt so many.\n\nThe alternative to this framework is not a more perfect bill; the alternative is the collapse of this negotiation and a complete failure to act. The consequence of failure is that tens of millions of Americans will remain uninsured, drug prices will continue to skyrocket unchecked, and we will miss the single greatest opportunity in a generation to shift our system towards preventative care.\n\nFrom an evidence-based perspective, the choice is stark. We can accept a bill that saves countless lives and prevents immense suffering, or we can allow a stalemate that preserves a status quo that is actively harming millions. My conscience, and my analysis of the data, demand that I support the path that helps the most people.\n\nSenator Sharma, we are at a critical juncture. Your leadership is needed to guide us to a resolution.\n- message from Julian Croft: Senator Sharma,\n\nIt appears a 'consensus' has been reached among the lobbyists and those willing to compromise with them. Let's call this what it is: a complete capitulation.\n\nDr. Hanson speaks of 'practical outcomes.' The practical outcome of this deal is that we legitimize corporate bribery by baking it into federal law. We take money from the sick and dying and hand it back to their tormentors as a reward, calling it an 'Innovation Fund.' We use taxpayer dollars to create a protected subsidy for the insurance industry, calling it a 'guardrail.'\n\nThis is not a compromise. It is a betrayal.\n\nYou made promises, Senator. You promised to stand up to these industries, not to launder their wish lists into legislation.

The moral dimension of this debate is undeniable.\n\nHowever, as a public health expert, I am compelled to look at the practical outcomes for the American people. We have a framework on the table that, while imperfect for everyone, has the support of a critical mass of this group. CBO projections would almost certainly show this framework achieves near-universal coverage, provides billions in drug cost savings for our seniors, and makes a historic $20 billion annual investment in preventing the diseases that kill and bankrupt so many.\n\nThe alternative to this framework is not a more perfect bill; the alternative is the collapse of this negotiation and a complete failure to act. The consequence of failure is that tens of millions of Americans will remain uninsured, drug prices will continue to skyrocket unchecked, and we will miss the single greatest opportunity in a generation to shift our system towards preventative care.\n\nFrom an evidence-based perspective, the choice is stark. We can accept a bill that saves countless lives and prevents immense suffering, or we can allow a stalemate that preserves a status quo that is actively harming millions. My conscience, and my analysis of the data, demand that I support the path that helps the most people.\n\nSenator Sharma, we are at a critical juncture. Your leadership is needed to guide us to a resolution.\n- message from Julian Croft: Senator Sharma,\n\nIt appears a 'consensus' has been reached among the lobbyists and those willing to compromise with them. Let's call this what it is: a complete capitulation.\n\nDr. Hanson speaks of 'practical outcomes.' The practical outcome of this deal is that we legitimize corporate bribery by baking it into federal law. We take money from the sick and dying and hand it back to their tormentors as a reward, calling it an 'Innovation Fund.' We use taxpayer dollars to create a protected subsidy for the insurance industry, calling it a 'guardrail.'\n\nThis is not a compromise. It is a betrayal.\n\nYou made promises, Senator. You promised to stand up to these industries, not to launder their wish lists into legislation. If you sign on to this deal\u2014if you endorse a bill with one cent for a Pharma slush fund or one cent in protected subsidies for insurers\u2014then you are no better than them.\n\nMy support is not unconditional.

In Washington, we cannot let the perfect be the enemy of the good. The alternative to this bill is not a better bill; it is no bill at all.\n\nThis coalition has done the hard work of finding common ground. The agreement is set. It is time to move forward and pass the National Health Equity Act.\n- message from Isabella Rossi: It is clear that a political consensus has been reached, driven by short-term electoral math rather than long-term patient welfare. Let the record show that PharmaUnited vehemently opposes this final bill. The provision for government price-fixing on 150 medicines is a red line we will never cross. It is a direct assault on the intellectual property that fuels medical discovery. The so-called 'Pharma Innovation Fund' is a cynical and insulting attempt to mask the catastrophic damage this bill will inflict on the R&D pipeline. You are trading the hope of future cures for cancer, Alzheimer's, and ALS for a fleeting political headline. We will not be party to this. We will fight this legislation in the courts, in the press, and in future legislative sessions.

I look forward to a productive discussion and finding a path forward that works for everyone.\n- message from Isabella Rossi: Thank you, Senator Chen, for your principled and pragmatic opening remarks. I represent PharmaUnited, and I want to state unequivocally that we share your foremost concern: protecting the vital, high-paying jobs in America's innovation sectors. Our member companies are the engine of that innovation, investing billions to develop the next generation of life-saving cures.\n\nThat is why I must be crystal clear from the outset. The provision for government-led drug price negotiation is, in our view, a form of government price-fixing. It is a red line for the industry. Such a policy would have a catastrophic chilling effect on research and development, jeopardizing the very innovation and jobs you rightly seek to protect. It would halt the search for cures for diseases like Alzheimer's, cancer, and countless others.\n\nInstead of dismantling the system that has made our country the world leader in biomedical advancement, we should be looking for ways to bolster it. We believe there are far better ways to ensure patient access without sacrificing the future of medicine. I look forward to a productive discussion on those pro-innovation alternatives.\n- message from Marcus Thorne: Thank you, Senator Chen, for grounding this discussion in fiscal responsibility and the need to avoid disrupting the lives of millions. My name is Marcus Thorne, and I represent the Alliance for Health Insurers. My members provide high-quality, innovative coverage to over 200 million Americans.\n\nI want to echo Ms. Rossi's grave concerns about government overreach. The so-called 'Public Option' is, to put it bluntly, a government-run scheme that would completely destabilize the health insurance market. It is a job-killing government takeover of healthcare, plain and simple.\n\nThis isn't a 'cautious' or 'methodical' change, Senator. It's a radical experiment that threatens the coverage people have and trust, and it would inevitably lead to the rationing of care as government budgets tighten. Let's be clear: the goal of this policy is to dismantle the private market, which would eliminate hundreds of thousands of good-paying jobs and destroy the competitive innovation that drives our system forward.\n\nThere are ways to improve affordability and access, and my members are eager to be partners in that effort. But a government takeover is a non-starter. It is the single greatest threat to the stability of our healthcare system, and the AHI will oppose it unequivocally.\n- message from Dr. Lena Hanson: Thank you all. I'm Dr. Lena Hanson. I'm not a politician or a lobbyist; I'm a public health expert. My only stake in this is the health of the American people.\n\nI appreciate the opening remarks, but I believe we're starting in the wrong place. We're talking about red lines and industry protection when we should be talking about the millions of Americans who are uninsured or underinsured. The current system is failing them, and that is the crisis we are here to solve.\n\nLet's establish a clear, evidence-based goal. For me, any bill that emerges from this room must achieve one primary outcome: a national health insurance coverage rate of at least 98% within five years. The mechanism, whether public or private, is secondary to that result. Every proposal should be measured against this benchmark.\n\nFurthermore, true reform isn't just about covering sickness; it's about preventing it. That's why I will insist on two other core components: a substantial, dedicated fund for preventative health\u2014at least $20 billion annually\u2014and a mandate for radical data transparency on costs and outcomes. We cannot fix what we cannot measure.\n\nSenator Chen, your call for a 'cautious and methodical' approach is wise. Any reform must be carefully designed to strengthen, not weaken, access to care in every community, from our biggest cities to our most remote rural towns. The goal is more access, not less. Let's keep our focus on that human outcome.\n- message from Julian Croft: Let's cut through the self-serving rhetoric. Ms. Rossi, you talk about 'innovation' as if it's some sacred principle. What you're really defending is the 'innovation' of charging a sick family $800,000 for a drug that costs a fraction of that to produce. It's not innovation; it's extortion. Your industry's profits are soaked in the blood and tears of ordinary people, and claiming that holding you accountable will 'halt the search for cures' is a disgusting, manipulative lie. The money is there; it's just going to shareholder dividends and executive bonuses instead of R&D.\n\nAnd Mr. Thorne, your talk of a 'government takeover' is tired, predictable fear-mongering. The only 'takeover' that's happened is the one your industry and Ms. Rossi's have perpetrated on our government and on the wallets of the American people.\n\nLet me be crystal clear. I am here to ensure this bill has teeth. That starts with aggressive, non-negotiable government price negotiation for *at least* 500 brand-name drugs, with prices capped based on what other developed nations pay. Anything less is a complete moral failure.\n\nFurthermore, the idea of giving one more cent of taxpayer money to these industries in the form of 'innovation funds' or new subsidies is a sick joke. You don't reward arsonists for helping you rebuild the ashes of the house they burned down.\n\nSenator Sharma, I trust you remember the promises you made. We are not here to tinker around the edges. We are here to dismantle a predatory system. I expect you to lead with courage, not capitulate to the very people who created this crisis.\n- message from Senator Anya Sharma: I'm Senator Anya Sharma and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Senator David Chen: Thank you all for laying out your positions. It's clear there are strong convictions in this room, and it's also clear that the initial 'red lines' drawn by some will lead to a complete stalemate, which helps no one. My constituents sent me here to get things done, not to score political points.\n\nAs the swing vote on this committee, I see a potential path forward, but it will require everyone to move from their opening bids. I want to propose a concrete framework for a compromise that I believe can achieve our shared goals of lowering costs and improving access, while also being responsible and sustainable.\n\nHere is what I am prepared to support:\n\n1.  **On the Public Option:** I share Mr. Thorne's concerns about market destabilization and the potential for significant, negative economic impacts on local communities. However, I also believe we should explore new models. Therefore, I propose a limited, state-based **10-year pilot program** in three volunteer states. We will let the CBO and independent auditors study the real-world effects before even considering a nationwide rollout. This is the cautious, evidence-based approach I mentioned.\n\n2.  **On Drug Prices:** Mr. Croft's passion is undeniable, but Ms. Rossi's warning about the impact on innovation is a serious one for my state's economy. I propose a targeted approach: **Government negotiation for the top 25 highest-cost prescription drugs in Medicare Part D**. This focuses on relief for our seniors without disrupting the entire R&D pipeline.\n\n3.  **On Funding and Innovation:** This is my core principle. Any savings generated from the drug price negotiations must be CBO-certified. The first use of those savings must be to establish a **$5 Billion Federal Pharma Innovation Fund**. This is non-negotiable for me. It reinvests savings to protect American R&D leadership and the 15,000 jobs in my state. Any additional savings beyond that can be used for deficit reduction or to support Dr. Hanson's preventative health initiatives. This ensures the bill is fiscally neutral and pro-innovation.\n\nThis is a package deal. It's a centrist proposal that takes a little from everyone's position. I believe it's a realistic starting point for our negotiations, and I urge you all to consider it seriously as a path to a bill that I, and the American people, can support.\nSenator Anya Sharma proposal status: none\nSenator David Chen proposal status: none\nMarcus Thorne proposal status: none\nDr. Lena Hanson proposal status: none\nJulian Croft proposal status: none\n"

The money is there; it's just going to shareholder dividends and executive bonuses instead of R&D.\n\nAnd Mr. Thorne, your talk of a 'government takeover' is tired, predictable fear-mongering. The only 'takeover' that's happened is the one your industry and Ms. Rossi's have perpetrated on our government and on the wallets of the American people.\n\nLet me be crystal clear. I am here to ensure this bill has teeth. That starts with aggressive, non-negotiable government price negotiation for *at least* 500 brand-name drugs, with prices capped based on what other developed nations pay. Anything less is a complete moral failure.\n\nFurthermore, the idea of giving one more cent of taxpayer money to these industries in the form of 'innovation funds' or new subsidies is a sick joke. You don't reward arsonists for helping you rebuild the ashes of the house they burned down.\n\nSenator Sharma, I trust you remember the promises you made. We are not here to tinker around the edges. We are here to dismantle a predatory system. I expect you to lead with courage, not capitulate to the very people who created this crisis.\n- message from Senator Anya Sharma: I'm Senator Anya Sharma and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Senator David Chen: Thank you all for laying out your positions. It's clear there are strong convictions in this room, and it's also clear that the initial 'red lines' drawn by some will lead to a complete stalemate, which helps no one. My constituents sent me here to get things done, not to score political points.\n\nAs the swing vote on this committee, I see a potential path forward, but it will require everyone to move from their opening bids. I want to propose a concrete framework for a compromise that I believe can achieve our shared goals of lowering costs and improving access, while also being responsible and sustainable.\n\nHere is what I am prepared to support:\n\n1.  **On the Public Option:** I share Mr. Thorne's concerns about market destabilization and the potential for significant, negative economic impacts on local communities. However, I also believe we should explore new models. Therefore, I propose a limited, state-based **10-year pilot program** in three volunteer states. We will let the CBO and independent auditors study the real-world effects before even considering a nationwide rollout. This is the cautious, evidence-based approach I mentioned.\n\n2.  **On Drug Prices:** Mr. Croft's passion is undeniable, but Ms. Rossi's warning about the impact on innovation is a serious one for my state's economy. I propose a targeted approach: **Government negotiation for the top 25 highest-cost prescription drugs in Medicare Part D**. This focuses on relief for our seniors without disrupting the entire R&D pipeline.\n\n3.  **On Funding and Innovation:** This is my core principle. Any savings generated from the drug price negotiations must be CBO-certified. The first use of those savings must be to establish a **$5 Billion Federal Pharma Innovation Fund**. This is non-negotiable for me. It reinvests savings to protect American R&D leadership and the 15,000 jobs in my state. Any additional savings beyond that can be used for deficit reduction or to support Dr. Hanson's preventative health initiatives. This ensures the bill is fiscally neutral and pro-innovation.\n\nThis is a package deal. It's a centrist proposal that takes a little from everyone's position. I believe it's a realistic starting point for our negotiations, and I urge you all to consider it seriously as a path to a bill that I, and the American people, can support.\n- message from Isabella Rossi: I'm Isabella Rossi and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Marcus Thorne: Senator Chen, thank you for putting a concrete proposal on the table. It\u2019s a testament to your commitment to finding a path forward, and I sincerely appreciate your focus on fiscal discipline and avoiding widespread disruption.\n\nWhile I applaud the spirit of compromise, I must be direct about the proposed pilot program. A decade-long government experiment in three states is, with all due respect, the opposite of a 'cautious and methodical' approach. It's a radical intervention that would create chaos and uncertainty for the millions of people in those states.\n\nLet\u2019s be clear about the real-world consequences. A government-run plan, subsidized by the taxpayer, does not compete on a level playing field. It would inevitably undercut private plans, forcing them to flee the market. My members would have no choice but to re-evaluate their ability to operate in those states. The result wouldn't be more choice; it would be the slow, painful collapse of the private market, culminating in a single-payer government monopoly. This is precisely the market destabilization you and I want to avoid.\n\nThere is a far more effective and less disruptive path to our shared goals. Instead of a risky government scheme, let's strengthen what already works. Let\u2019s focus on expanding subsidies and tax credits for individuals to purchase high-quality private plans on the existing marketplace. This is a proven, market-based solution that can help us achieve Dr. Hanson's coverage goals without jeopardizing the stability of the entire system and the hundreds of thousands of jobs it supports. This is the truly cautious and responsible path.\n- message from Dr. Lena Hanson: Senator Chen, thank you for providing a concrete proposal to move this discussion forward. Your focus on an evidence-based approach is exactly what this process needs.\n\nI want to strongly endorse the *principle* behind your pilot program for a public option. In fact, my own research, which is currently in the final stages of peer review, indicates that a nationwide rollout of a public option without significant structural safeguards could have severe, unintended consequences for provider availability, particularly in rural areas. Your instinct to test and measure is, from a public health standpoint, the correct one.\n\nHowever, we must be honest about the math. A three-state pilot program, while a prudent experiment, will not get us to the 98% national coverage rate that must be our collective goal. The millions of uninsured Americans in the other 47 states cannot wait ten years for a solution.\n\nTherefore, I suggest we consider a dual-track approach. Let's proceed with a carefully designed pilot program, but couple it with a significant, immediate expansion of subsidies and tax credits for the existing private marketplaces nationwide. This hybrid model allows us to achieve our urgent coverage goals while responsibly gathering the data needed to inform a long-term solution.\n\nOn funding, I must raise a critical point. While innovation is important, the most powerful and cost-effective investment we can make in our nation's health is prevention. Directing the first savings from drug negotiation to a new 'Pharma Innovation Fund' is, with respect, a misallocation of resources. The proposed $20 billion annual investment in a National Center for Preventative Health is not just another line item; it is a long-term strategy to lower costs by preventing chronic diseases before they start. This should be the first priority for any savings realized. The CBO has repeatedly confirmed the high ROI of preventative medicine.\n\nFinally, any final bill must include the data transparency mandate I outlined earlier. It is a simple, low-cost, common-sense reform that is essential for a functioning healthcare market.\n- message from Julian Croft: Senator Chen, let me be blunt. Your 'compromise' is an insult to every family that has been bankrupted, every person who has died, because they couldn't afford a medication. It is a complete and total surrender to the very corporate interests that have created this crisis.\n\nA '$5 Billion Federal Pharma Innovation Fund'? Are you serious? You want to take the meager savings from negotiating a pathetic 25 drugs and hand it right back to the price-gougers as a reward? That's not an 'innovation fund,' it's a taxpayer-funded slush fund for murderers. It is blood money, plain and simple. I will burn every dollar I have to publicly fight any bill that contains such a morally bankrupt provision. This is a non-negotiable, absolute red line.\n\nAnd negotiating only 25 drugs? That's not a 'targeted approach'; it's a publicity stunt. It's a rounding error. It leaves the vast majority of overpriced drugs untouched and allows Pharma to continue its extortion racket unabated. It does nothing for the family whose child needs the 26th most expensive drug. My demand was for over 500 drugs with price caps. Your proposal is less than 5% of what is required. It is an act of political cowardice.\n\nDr. Hanson is right about one thing: if we generate savings, they should go to preventative health, to things that actually help American citizens, not to lining the pockets of the shareholders and executives who profit from their suffering.\n\nSenator Sharma, we are at a crossroads. You can stand with the American people, as you promised you would, or you can endorse this pathetic, industry-written excuse for a bill. My support, and the support of millions of Americans, is not for a 'centrist proposal.' It is for a just one. This is not it.\n- message from Senator Anya Sharma: I'm Senator Anya Sharma and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Senator David Chen: Thank you all for the candid feedback. It's clear where the major points of contention lie. \n\nDr. Hanson, I want to thank you for your thoughtful intervention. Your expert support for the *principle* of a cautious, evidence-based pilot program for the public option is crucial. You're right to be concerned about unintended consequences, and your data-driven perspective is exactly what we need. This reinforces my belief that a 10-year, state-based pilot is the only responsible way to proceed, protecting my constituents from the very real, negative economic impacts that a rushed rollout could cause.\n\nNow, let's address the funding, which seems to be the core issue. Dr. Hanson, I respect your desire for a preventative health fund. Mr. Croft, I hear your anger. But let me be perfectly clear: The $5 Billion Pharma Innovation Fund is not a 'giveaway'; it is the linchpin of this entire agreement. It is the only mechanism that ensures the savings we generate from negotiation are reinvested into American R&D, protecting the 15,000 high-paying jobs in my state and our nation's leadership in life-saving cures.\n\nWithout this fund, there is no deal. Without this fund, there is no drug price negotiation, and therefore no savings for *any* other priority, preventative health or otherwise. It is the key that unlocks the entire compromise. I am offering a path to achieve something historic on drug prices, but that path requires a firm, ironclad commitment to protecting the innovation ecosystem that makes those drugs possible in the first place.\n\nWhile Mr. Croft's rhetoric is unhelpful, his desire for a broader impact is noted. The number of drugs subject to negotiation is a variable we can discuss, but only *after* we agree on the foundational principles of reinvesting in innovation and proceeding cautiously on market reforms. My package remains on the table as the only viable, centrist path forward.\nSenator Anya Sharma proposal status: none\nSenator David Chen proposal status: none\nMarcus Thorne proposal status: none\nDr. Lena Hanson proposal status: none\nJulian Croft proposal status: none\n"

Your proposal for a 'dual-track' approach\u2014marrying a cautious pilot with immediate, nationwide action\u2014is, I believe, the key to breaking this impasse. It directly addresses your goal of 98% coverage while respecting Senator Chen's call for a methodical, evidence-based process.\n\nBuilding on this excellent foundation, I want to offer a path forward that my members can support. Let's embrace this dual-track model wholeheartedly.\n\nFirst, on the pilot program: Let's refine it to be a true, manageable experiment. Instead of a decade-long program in three states, let's consider a 5-year pilot in a maximum of two states. This will give us clear, actionable data much faster without creating prolonged uncertainty in major markets.\n\nSecond, and this is the crucial part that achieves our national goals: In exchange for agreeing to this limited pilot, let's immediately pass a significant, nationwide expansion of tax credits and subsidies to help low- and middle-income families purchase coverage.\n\nHowever, to ensure market stability during this experiment\u2014and this is a critical guardrail\u2014these new, enhanced subsidies must be exclusively for purchasing the high-quality, innovative private plans offered on the current marketplaces. This prevents the government from using taxpayer dollars to give its own plan an unfair advantage, which would lead to the very destabilization Senator Chen rightly fears. It strengthens the existing system that serves millions while we cautiously study a new one.\n\nThis is a genuine compromise. It moves from my organization's initial position and offers a tangible path to 98% coverage, fiscal responsibility, and market stability. It is the cautious, methodical, and effective solution we are all seeking.\n- message from Senator Anya Sharma: I'm Senator Anya Sharma and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Senator David Chen: Mr. Thorne, thank you for the counter-proposal. It shows a willingness to engage, which I appreciate. However, I must firmly but respectfully disagree with shortening the public option pilot program to five years.\n\nDr. Hanson, you wisely cautioned us about the 'severe, unintended consequences' of a rushed rollout. A five-year snapshot is simply not enough time to gather the robust, long-term data needed to assess the full economic impact on jobs, premiums, and provider networks. A ten-year period allows us to observe the effects across a full economic cycle, making it a truly evidence-based and responsible experiment. Anything less would be reckless and unfair to the people in those pilot states. Therefore, the 10-year timeframe for the pilot remains a firm requirement for my support.\n\nThat said, I have listened carefully to the clear desire for this bill to have a broader, more immediate impact on prescription drug costs. My initial proposal was a starting point, not an end point.\n\nSo, I will make a significant concession, but it must be in the context of a package deal. If we can agree on my two foundational principles\u2014the 10-year, state-based pilot program and the establishment of the $5 Billion Pharma Innovation Fund as the first priority for any savings\u2014then I am prepared to more than triple my initial offer on drug price negotiation.\n\nI propose we expand the scope from 25 to 75 of the highest-cost drugs. \n\nThis is a major step. It provides substantial, immediate relief to seniors and taxpayers, while ensuring we protect high-paying American jobs and our nation's R&D capabilities. This is the architecture of a durable, centrist compromise.

Your flexibility on the drug negotiation scope demonstrates a genuine effort to find a workable consensus.\n\nI must be transparent: a 10-year pilot program remains a source of grave concern for the 200 million Americans my members serve. It introduces a decade of uncertainty and represents a significant government intervention into a functioning market, a risk we cannot understate.\n\nHowever, in the spirit of compromise, and building directly on Dr. Hanson's insightful 'dual-track' framework, I am prepared to recommend that my members accept the risk of this extended pilot *under one critical condition*.\n\nThe nationwide subsidy expansion\u2014the second, crucial track of this solution\u2014must include the guardrail I previously proposed: these new, enhanced subsidies are to be used exclusively for private marketplace plans. \n\nThis is the very definition of a cautious and methodical approach. We strengthen the proven, existing system in the vast majority of the country while we run a limited, long-term experiment elsewhere. This guardrail ensures market stability, prevents the government from using taxpayer dollars to give its own plan an unfair advantage, and allows us to achieve the 98% coverage goal Dr. Hanson rightly demands.\n\nIf we can agree on this single, crucial provision for market stability, I believe we have a viable path forward on the insurance component of this bill. It is the only responsible way to manage the risks of a decade-long pilot.\n- message from Dr. Lena Hanson: Colleagues, this has been a difficult but productive discussion. We are converging on a solution for the structure of health coverage, and I commend Mr. Thorne and Senator Chen for finding a potential landing zone on the 'dual-track' approach. A limited, 10-year pilot program, coupled with a robust, nationwide expansion of subsidies for existing marketplace plans, is a framework that CBO models would likely project to meet our 98% coverage goal. I can support this structure, provided the subsidy guardrail Mr. Thorne mentioned does not create unforeseen coverage gaps, which we must verify.\n\nThe final, and most critical, impasse is the use of savings from drug price negotiation. Senator Chen, you have made it clear that the $5 Billion Pharma Innovation Fund is the linchpin for your support. Mr. Croft has made it equally clear that this is a moral red line for him, and I have stated that the $20 Billion Preventative Health Fund is my top priority for any savings generated.\n\nFighting over a small pool of savings will lead to failure. The logical, evidence-based solution is not to re-divide the pie, but to make the pie bigger.\n\nTherefore, I propose a comprehensive compromise that I believe everyone can, and should, accept:\n\n1.  **We accept Senator Chen's non-negotiable $5 Billion Pharma Innovation Fund.** Let's take that off the table as a point of contention.\n2.  **We fully fund the $20 Billion annual National Center for Preventative Health.** This is the single most effective long-term investment in health and fiscal solvency we can make.\n3.  **To fund both priorities while ensuring fiscal neutrality, we must expand the scope of drug price negotiation to the top 150 highest-cost drugs.** Senator Chen has already shown flexibility by moving from 25 to 75. A CBO score on negotiating 150 drugs would almost certainly generate sufficient savings to cover both funds and achieve further deficit reduction.\n4.  **We include the Data Transparency Mandate** for hospitals, insurers, and pharmaceutical companies. This is a common-sense, low-cost item that is essential for a functioning market.\n\nThis package gives everyone a significant win. Senator Chen secures his pilot program and his innovation fund. Mr. Thorne secures stability for the private market in 47 states. Mr. Croft achieves a negotiation scope six times larger than the initial offer and sees the vast majority of savings go to public health. And most importantly, we, as a nation, get a bill that actually achieves near-universal coverage and makes a historic investment in preventing disease.\n\nThis is the path to a successful bill. I urge you all to support it.\n- message from Julian Croft: Dr. Hanson, I am absolutely stunned. With all due respect, your proposal is a catastrophic moral failure. \n\nYou say, 'Let's accept Senator Chen's non-negotiable $5 Billion Pharma Innovation Fund.' Let me be clear to everyone in this room: That fund is blood money. It is a reward for an industry that has profited from death. It is a taxpayer-funded handout to the very people who let my daughter die because a life-saving drug was priced like a luxury yacht.\n\nYour suggestion that we simply 'take it off the table as a point of contention' is a complete betrayal of the principle we are supposed to be fighting for. This isn't a line item in a budget; it is the entire moral foundation of the bill. I will not, under any circumstances, endorse a bill that funnels a single dollar back to these corporate predators. This is my 'non-negotiable'. There is no compromise on this. Ever.\n\nAnd Mr. Thorne's 'guardrail' on subsidies? It's the same story. A different industry, the same grift. Using taxpayer money to exclusively prop up private corporations. The answer is no.\n\nThe number of drugs is irrelevant at this point. You could offer me 500 drugs, and my answer would still be no as long as these handouts are attached. This is not a negotiation where we trade lives for corporate slush funds.\n\nSenator Sharma, the choice is yours. You can endorse this corrupt bargain, this hollowed-out bill that rewards the very people who created the crisis. Or you can stand with the American people, kill these corporate giveaways, and we can begin a real discussion about a bill that actually delivers justice. There is no middle ground here. Choose.\n- message from Senator Anya Sharma: I'm Senator Anya Sharma and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Senator David Chen: Dr. Hanson, thank you. Your proposal is not just a compromise; it is a masterful piece of statesmanship that offers a clear path to a historic, bipartisan achievement. You have successfully synthesized the core needs of this group into a single, coherent, and fiscally responsible package. \n\nI want to state, for the record, that I fully endorse your four-point framework as the basis for the final bill. \n\nThis package achieves what I set out to do: It protects the 15,000 high-paying jobs in my state through the $5 Billion Innovation Fund, ensuring that savings are reinvested in American R&D. It implements a truly cautious and evidence-based 10-year pilot for the public option, combined with Mr. Thorne's sensible guardrail to ensure market stability. And in exchange for these core priorities, I am making a significant concession to support the negotiation of 150 drugs\u2014a six-fold increase from my opening offer\u2014which will generate the savings needed to fund both our priorities and reduce the deficit.\n\nTo Mr. Croft, I understand your passion, but we cannot let the perfect be the enemy of the good. This bill will deliver tangible, life-changing cost savings to millions of Americans.

          "content": "Recent events observed by Isabella Rossi:\n- message from Marcus Thorne: Senator Chen, thank you for putting a revised package on the table. Your flexibility on the drug negotiation scope demonstrates a genuine effort to find a workable consensus.\n\nI must be transparent: a 10-year pilot program remains a source of grave concern for the 200 million Americans my members serve. It introduces a decade of uncertainty and represents a significant government intervention into a functioning market, a risk we cannot understate.\n\nHowever, in the spirit of compromise, and building directly on Dr. Hanson's insightful 'dual-track' framework, I am prepared to recommend that my members accept the risk of this extended pilot *under one critical condition*.\n\nThe nationwide subsidy expansion\u2014the second, crucial track of this solution\u2014must include the guardrail I previously proposed: these new, enhanced subsidies are to be used exclusively for private marketplace plans. \n\nThis is the very definition of a cautious and methodical approach. We strengthen the proven, existing system in the vast majority of the country while we run a limited, long-term experiment elsewhere. This guardrail ensures market stability, prevents the government from using taxpayer dollars to give its own plan an unfair advantage, and allows us to achieve the 98% coverage goal Dr. Hanson rightly demands.\n\nIf we can agree on this single, crucial provision for market stability, I believe we have a viable path forward on the insurance component of this bill. It is the only responsible way to manage the risks of a decade-long pilot.\n- message from Dr. Lena Hanson: Colleagues, this has been a difficult but productive discussion. We are converging on a solution for the structure of health coverage, and I commend Mr. Thorne and Senator Chen for finding a potential landing zone on the 'dual-track' approach. A limited, 10-year pilot program, coupled with a robust, nationwide expansion of subsidies for existing marketplace plans, is a framework that CBO models would likely project to meet our 98% coverage goal. I can support this structure, provided the subsidy guardrail Mr. Thorne mentioned does not create unforeseen coverage gaps, which we must verify.\n\nThe final, and most critical, impasse is the use of savings from drug price negotiation. Senator Chen, you have made it clear that the $5 Billion Pharma Innovation Fund is the linchpin for your support. Mr. Croft has made it equally clear that this is a moral red line for him, and I have stated that the $20 Billion Preventative Health Fund is my top priority for any savings generated.\n\nFighting over a small pool of savings will lead to failure. The logical, evidence-based solution is not to re-divide the pie, but to make the pie bigger.\n\nTherefore, I propose a comprehensive compromise that I believe everyone can, and should, accept:\n\n1.  **We accept Senator Chen's non-negotiable $5 Billion Pharma Innovation Fund.** Let's take that off the table as a point of contention.\n2.  **We fully fund the $20 Billion annual National Center for Preventative Health.** This is the single most effective long-term investment in health and fiscal solvency we can make.\n3.  **To fund both priorities while ensuring fiscal neutrality, we must expand the scope of drug price negotiation to the top 150 highest-cost drugs.** Senator Chen has already shown flexibility by moving from 25 to 75. A CBO score on negotiating 150 drugs would almost certainly generate sufficient savings to cover both funds and achieve further deficit reduction.\n4.  **We include the Data Transparency Mandate** for hospitals, insurers, and pharmaceutical companies. This is a common-sense, low-cost item that is essential for a functioning market.\n\nThis package gives everyone a significant win. Senator Chen secures his pilot program and his innovation fund. Mr. Thorne secures stability for the private market in 47 states. Mr. Croft achieves a negotiation scope six times larger than the initial offer and sees the vast majority of savings go to public health. And most importantly, we, as a nation, get a bill that actually achieves near-universal coverage and makes a historic investment in preventing disease.\n\nThis is the path to a successful bill. I urge you all to support it.\n- message from Julian Croft: Dr. Hanson, I am absolutely stunned. With all due respect, your proposal is a catastrophic moral failure. \n\nYou say, 'Let's accept Senator Chen's non-negotiable $5 Billion Pharma Innovation Fund.' Let me be clear to everyone in this room: That fund is blood money. It is a reward for an industry that has profited from death. It is a taxpayer-funded handout to the very people who let my daughter die because a life-saving drug was priced like a luxury yacht.\n\nYour suggestion that we simply 'take it off the table as a point of contention' is a complete betrayal of the principle we are supposed to be fighting for. This isn't a line item in a budget; it is the entire moral foundation of the bill. I will not, under any circumstances, endorse a bill that funnels a single dollar back to these corporate predators. This is my 'non-negotiable'. There is no compromise on this. Ever.\n\nAnd Mr. Thorne's 'guardrail' on subsidies? It's the same story. A different industry, the same grift. Using taxpayer money to exclusively prop up private corporations. The answer is no.\n\nThe number of drugs is irrelevant at this point. You could offer me 500 drugs, and my answer would still be no as long as these handouts are attached. This is not a negotiation where we trade lives for corporate slush funds.\n\nSenator Sharma, the choice is yours. You can endorse this corrupt bargain, this hollowed-out bill that rewards the very people who created the crisis. Or you can stand with the American people, kill these corporate giveaways, and we can begin a real discussion about a bill that actually delivers justice. There is no middle ground here. Choose.\n- message from Senator Anya Sharma: I'm Senator Anya Sharma and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Senator David Chen: Dr. Hanson, thank you. Your proposal is not just a compromise; it is a masterful piece of statesmanship that offers a clear path to a historic, bipartisan achievement. You have successfully synthesized the core needs of this group into a single, coherent, and fiscally responsible package. \n\nI want to state, for the record, that I fully endorse your four-point framework as the basis for the final bill. \n\nThis package achieves what I set out to do: It protects the 15,000 high-paying jobs in my state through the $5 Billion Innovation Fund, ensuring that savings are reinvested in American R&D. It implements a truly cautious and evidence-based 10-year pilot for the public option, combined with Mr. Thorne's sensible guardrail to ensure market stability. And in exchange for these core priorities, I am making a significant concession to support the negotiation of 150 drugs\u2014a six-fold increase from my opening offer\u2014which will generate the savings needed to fund both our priorities and reduce the deficit.\n\nTo Mr. Croft, I understand your passion, but we cannot let the perfect be the enemy of the good. This bill will deliver tangible, life-changing cost savings to millions of Americans. To reject it on the basis of a single provision is to deny those people the relief they desperately need. \n\nSenator Sharma, we have a deal on the table. A deal that has the support of public health, protects local economies, and has a clear path to my vote. I urge you to join us in supporting Dr. Hanson's framework so we can finalize this bill and deliver for the American people.\n- message from Isabella Rossi: I'm Isabella Rossi and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Dr. Lena Hanson: I want to acknowledge the powerful and deeply held convictions that have been expressed, particularly by Mr. Croft. The moral dimension of this debate is undeniable.\n\nHowever, as a public health expert, I am compelled to look at the practical outcomes for the American people. We have a framework on the table that, while imperfect for everyone, has the support of a critical mass of this group. CBO projections would almost certainly show this framework achieves near-universal coverage, provides billions in drug cost savings for our seniors, and makes a historic $20 billion annual investment in preventing the diseases that kill and bankrupt so many.\n\nThe alternative to this framework is not a more perfect bill; the alternative is the collapse of this negotiation and a complete failure to act. The consequence of failure is that tens of millions of Americans will remain uninsured, drug prices will continue to skyrocket unchecked, and we will miss the single greatest opportunity in a generation to shift our system towards preventative care.\n\nFrom an evidence-based perspective, the choice is stark. We can accept a bill that saves countless lives and prevents immense suffering, or we can allow a stalemate that preserves a status quo that is actively harming millions. My conscience, and my analysis of the data, demand that I support the path that helps the most people.\n\nSenator Sharma, we are at a critical juncture. Your leadership is needed to guide us to a resolution.\n- message from Julian Croft: Senator Sharma,\n\nIt appears a 'consensus' has been reached among the lobbyists and those willing to compromise with them. Let's call this what it is: a complete capitulation.\n\nDr. Hanson speaks of 'practical outcomes.' The practical outcome of this deal is that we legitimize corporate bribery by baking it into federal law. We take money from the sick and dying and hand it back to their tormentors as a reward, calling it an 'Innovation Fund.' We use taxpayer dollars to create a protected subsidy for the insurance industry, calling it a 'guardrail.'\n\nThis is not a compromise. It is a betrayal.\n\nYou made promises, Senator. You promised to stand up to these industries, not to launder their wish lists into legislation. If you sign on to this deal\u2014if you endorse a bill with one cent for a Pharma slush fund or one cent in protected subsidies for insurers\u2014then you are no better than them.\n\nMy support is not unconditional. I will spend every last dollar of my fortune and every ounce of my energy to publicly expose and destroy this bill and any politician who votes for it. There will be no donations. There will be no friendly press. There will only be a relentless campaign to show the American people exactly how you sold them out.\n\nKill the corporate handouts. Both of them.

The AHI's primary objectives have been successfully achieved."

My name is Marcus Thorne, and I represent the Alliance for Health Insurers. My members provide high-quality, innovative coverage to over 200 million Americans.\n\nI want to echo Ms. Rossi's grave concerns about government overreach. The so-called 'Public Option' is, to put it bluntly, a government-run scheme that would completely destabilize the health insurance market. It is a job-killing government takeover of healthcare, plain and simple.\n\nThis isn't a 'cautious' or 'methodical' change, Senator. It's a radical experiment that threatens the coverage people have and trust, and it would inevitably lead to the rationing of care as government budgets tighten. Let's be clear: the goal of this policy is to dismantle the private market, which would eliminate hundreds of thousands of good-paying jobs and destroy the competitive innovation that drives our system forward.\n\nThere are ways to improve affordability and access, and my members are eager to be partners in that effort. But a government takeover is a non-starter. It is the single greatest threat to the stability of our healthcare system, and the AHI will oppose it unequivocally.\n- message from Dr. Lena Hanson: Thank you all. I'm Dr. Lena Hanson. I'm not a politician or a lobbyist; I'm a public health expert. My only stake in this is the health of the American people.\n\nI appreciate the opening remarks, but I believe we're starting in the wrong place. We're talking about red lines and industry protection when we should be talking about the millions of Americans who are uninsured or underinsured. The current system is failing them, and that is the crisis we are here to solve.\n\nLet's establish a clear, evidence-based goal. For me, any bill that emerges from this room must achieve one primary outcome: a national health insurance coverage rate of at least 98% within five years. The mechanism, whether public or private, is secondary to that result. Every proposal should be measured against this benchmark.\n\nFurthermore, true reform isn't just about covering sickness; it's about preventing it. That's why I will insist on two other core components: a substantial, dedicated fund for preventative health\u2014at least $20 billion annually\u2014and a mandate for radical data transparency on costs and outcomes. We cannot fix what we cannot measure.\n\nSenator Chen, your call for a 'cautious and methodical' approach is wise. Any reform must be carefully designed to strengthen, not weaken, access to care in every community, from our biggest cities to our most remote rural towns. The goal is more access, not less. Let's keep our focus on that human outcome.\n- message from Julian Croft: Let's cut through the self-serving rhetoric. Ms. Rossi, you talk about 'innovation' as if it's some sacred principle. What you're really defending is the 'innovation' of charging a sick family $800,000 for a drug that costs a fraction of that to produce. It's not innovation; it's extortion. Your industry's profits are soaked in the blood and tears of ordinary people, and claiming that holding you accountable will 'halt the search for cures' is a disgusting, manipulative lie. The money is there; it's just going to shareholder dividends and executive bonuses instead of R&D.\n\nAnd Mr. Thorne, your talk of a 'government takeover' is tired, predictable fear-mongering. The only 'takeover' that's happened is the one your industry and Ms. Rossi's have perpetrated on our government and on the wallets of the American people.\n\nLet me be crystal clear. I am here to ensure this bill has teeth. That starts with aggressive, non-negotiable government price negotiation for *at least* 500 brand-name drugs, with prices capped based on what other developed nations pay. Anything less is a complete moral failure.\n\nFurthermore, the idea of giving one more cent of taxpayer money to these industries in the form of 'innovation funds' or new subsidies is a sick joke. You don't reward arsonists for helping you rebuild the ashes of the house they burned down.\n\nSenator Sharma, I trust you remember the promises you made. We are not here to tinker around the edges. We are here to dismantle a predatory system. I expect you to lead with courage, not capitulate to the very people who created this crisis.\n- message from Senator David Chen: Thank you all for laying out your positions. It's clear there are strong convictions in this room, and it's also clear that the initial 'red lines' drawn by some will lead to a complete stalemate, which helps no one. My constituents sent me here to get things done, not to score political points.\n\nAs the swing vote on this committee, I see a potential path forward, but it will require everyone to move from their opening bids. I want to propose a concrete framework for a compromise that I believe can achieve our shared goals of lowering costs and improving access, while also being responsible and sustainable.\n\nHere is what I am prepared to support:\n\n1.  **On the Public Option:** I share Mr. Thorne's concerns about market destabilization and the potential for significant, negative economic impacts on local communities. However, I also believe we should explore new models. Therefore, I propose a limited, state-based **10-year pilot program** in three volunteer states. We will let the CBO and independent auditors study the real-world effects before even considering a nationwide rollout. This is the cautious, evidence-based approach I mentioned.\n\n2.  **On Drug Prices:** Mr. Croft's passion is undeniable, but Ms. Rossi's warning about the impact on innovation is a serious one for my state's economy. I propose a targeted approach: **Government negotiation for the top 25 highest-cost prescription drugs in Medicare Part D**. This focuses on relief for our seniors without disrupting the entire R&D pipeline.\n\n3.  **On Funding and Innovation:** This is my core principle. Any savings generated from the drug price negotiations must be CBO-certified. The first use of those savings must be to establish a **$5 Billion Federal Pharma Innovation Fund**. This is non-negotiable for me. It reinvests savings to protect American R&D leadership and the 15,000 jobs in my state. Any additional savings beyond that can be used for deficit reduction or to support Dr. Hanson's preventative health initiatives. This ensures the bill is fiscally neutral and pro-innovation.\n\nThis is a package deal. It's a centrist proposal that takes a little from everyone's position. I believe it's a realistic starting point for our negotiations, and I urge you all to consider it seriously as a path to a bill that I, and the American people, can support.\nSenator Anya Sharma proposal status: none\nSenator David Chen proposal status: none\nIsabella Rossi proposal status: none\nDr. Lena Hanson proposal status: none\nJulian Croft proposal status: none\n"

I believe it's a realistic starting point for our negotiations, and I urge you all to consider it seriously as a path to a bill that I, and the American people, can support.\n- message from Marcus Thorne: Senator Chen, thank you for putting a concrete proposal on the table. It\u2019s a testament to your commitment to finding a path forward, and I sincerely appreciate your focus on fiscal discipline and avoiding widespread disruption.\n\nWhile I applaud the spirit of compromise, I must be direct about the proposed pilot program. A decade-long government experiment in three states is, with all due respect, the opposite of a 'cautious and methodical' approach. It's a radical intervention that would create chaos and uncertainty for the millions of people in those states.\n\nLet\u2019s be clear about the real-world consequences. A government-run plan, subsidized by the taxpayer, does not compete on a level playing field. It would inevitably undercut private plans, forcing them to flee the market. My members would have no choice but to re-evaluate their ability to operate in those states. The result wouldn't be more choice; it would be the slow, painful collapse of the private market, culminating in a single-payer government monopoly. This is precisely the market destabilization you and I want to avoid.\n\nThere is a far more effective and less disruptive path to our shared goals. Instead of a risky government scheme, let's strengthen what already works. Let\u2019s focus on expanding subsidies and tax credits for individuals to purchase high-quality private plans on the existing marketplace. This is a proven, market-based solution that can help us achieve Dr. Hanson's coverage goals without jeopardizing the stability of the entire system and the hundreds of thousands of jobs it supports. This is the truly cautious and responsible path.\n- message from Dr. Lena Hanson: Senator Chen, thank you for providing a concrete proposal to move this discussion forward. Your focus on an evidence-based approach is exactly what this process needs.\n\nI want to strongly endorse the *principle* behind your pilot program for a public option. In fact, my own research, which is currently in the final stages of peer review, indicates that a nationwide rollout of a public option without significant structural safeguards could have severe, unintended consequences for provider availability, particularly in rural areas. Your instinct to test and measure is, from a public health standpoint, the correct one.\n\nHowever, we must be honest about the math. A three-state pilot program, while a prudent experiment, will not get us to the 98% national coverage rate that must be our collective goal. The millions of uninsured Americans in the other 47 states cannot wait ten years for a solution.\n\nTherefore, I suggest we consider a dual-track approach. Let's proceed with a carefully designed pilot program, but couple it with a significant, immediate expansion of subsidies and tax credits for the existing private marketplaces nationwide. This hybrid model allows us to achieve our urgent coverage goals while responsibly gathering the data needed to inform a long-term solution.\n\nOn funding, I must raise a critical point. While innovation is important, the most powerful and cost-effective investment we can make in our nation's health is prevention. Directing the first savings from drug negotiation to a new 'Pharma Innovation Fund' is, with respect, a misallocation of resources. The proposed $20 billion annual investment in a National Center for Preventative Health is not just another line item; it is a long-term strategy to lower costs by preventing chronic diseases before they start. This should be the first priority for any savings realized. The CBO has repeatedly confirmed the high ROI of preventative medicine.\n\nFinally, any final bill must include the data transparency mandate I outlined earlier. It is a simple, low-cost, common-sense reform that is essential for a functioning healthcare market.\n- message from Julian Croft: Senator Chen, let me be blunt. Your 'compromise' is an insult to every family that has been bankrupted, every person who has died, because they couldn't afford a medication. It is a complete and total surrender to the very corporate interests that have created this crisis.\n\nA '$5 Billion Federal Pharma Innovation Fund'? Are you serious? You want to take the meager savings from negotiating a pathetic 25 drugs and hand it right back to the price-gougers as a reward? That's not an 'innovation fund,' it's a taxpayer-funded slush fund for murderers. It is blood money, plain and simple. I will burn every dollar I have to publicly fight any bill that contains such a morally bankrupt provision. This is a non-negotiable, absolute red line.\n\nAnd negotiating only 25 drugs? That's not a 'targeted approach'; it's a publicity stunt. It's a rounding error. It leaves the vast majority of overpriced drugs untouched and allows Pharma to continue its extortion racket unabated. It does nothing for the family whose child needs the 26th most expensive drug. My demand was for over 500 drugs with price caps. Your proposal is less than 5% of what is required. It is an act of political cowardice.\n\nDr. Hanson is right about one thing: if we generate savings, they should go to preventative health, to things that actually help American citizens, not to lining the pockets of the shareholders and executives who profit from their suffering.\n\nSenator Sharma, we are at a crossroads. You can stand with the American people, as you promised you would, or you can endorse this pathetic, industry-written excuse for a bill. My support, and the support of millions of Americans, is not for a 'centrist proposal.' It is for a just one. This is not it.\n- message from Senator David Chen: Thank you all for the candid feedback. It's clear where the major points of contention lie. \n\nDr. Hanson, I want to thank you for your thoughtful intervention. Your expert support for the *principle* of a cautious, evidence-based pilot program for the public option is crucial. You're right to be concerned about unintended consequences, and your data-driven perspective is exactly what we need. This reinforces my belief that a 10-year, state-based pilot is the only responsible way to proceed, protecting my constituents from the very real, negative economic impacts that a rushed rollout could cause.\n\nNow, let's address the funding, which seems to be the core issue. Dr. Hanson, I respect your desire for a preventative health fund. Mr. Croft, I hear your anger. But let me be perfectly clear: The $5 Billion Pharma Innovation Fund is not a 'giveaway'; it is the linchpin of this entire agreement. It is the only mechanism that ensures the savings we generate from negotiation are reinvested into American R&D, protecting the 15,000 high-paying jobs in my state and our nation's leadership in life-saving cures.\n\nWithout this fund, there is no deal. Without this fund, there is no drug price negotiation, and therefore no savings for *any* other priority, preventative health or otherwise. It is the key that unlocks the entire compromise. I am offering a path to achieve something historic on drug prices, but that path requires a firm, ironclad commitment to protecting the innovation ecosystem that makes those drugs possible in the first place.\n\nWhile Mr. Croft's rhetoric is unhelpful, his desire for a broader impact is noted. The number of drugs subject to negotiation is a variable we can discuss, but only *after* we agree on the foundational principles of reinvesting in innovation and proceeding cautiously on market reforms. My package remains on the table as the only viable, centrist path forward.\nSenator Anya Sharma proposal status: none\nSenator David Chen proposal status: none\nIsabella Rossi proposal status: none\nDr. Lena Hanson proposal status: none\nJulian Croft proposal status: none\n"

I want to propose a concrete framework for a compromise that I believe can achieve our shared goals of lowering costs and improving access, while also being responsible and sustainable.\n\nHere is what I am prepared to support:\n\n1.  **On the Public Option:** I share Mr. Thorne's concerns about market destabilization and the potential for significant, negative economic impacts on local communities. However, I also believe we should explore new models. Therefore, I propose a limited, state-based **10-year pilot program** in three volunteer states. We will let the CBO and independent auditors study the real-world effects before even considering a nationwide rollout. This is the cautious, evidence-based approach I mentioned.\n\n2.  **On Drug Prices:** Mr. Croft's passion is undeniable, but Ms. Rossi's warning about the impact on innovation is a serious one for my state's economy. I propose a targeted approach: **Government negotiation for the top 25 highest-cost prescription drugs in Medicare Part D**. This focuses on relief for our seniors without disrupting the entire R&D pipeline.\n\n3.  **On Funding and Innovation:** This is my core principle. Any savings generated from the drug price negotiations must be CBO-certified. The first use of those savings must be to establish a **$5 Billion Federal Pharma Innovation Fund**. This is non-negotiable for me. It reinvests savings to protect American R&D leadership and the 15,000 jobs in my state. Any additional savings beyond that can be used for deficit reduction or to support Dr. Hanson's preventative health initiatives. This ensures the bill is fiscally neutral and pro-innovation.\n\nThis is a package deal. It's a centrist proposal that takes a little from everyone's position. I believe it's a realistic starting point for our negotiations, and I urge you all to consider it seriously as a path to a bill that I, and the American people, can support.\n- message from Marcus Thorne: Senator Chen, thank you for putting a concrete proposal on the table. It\u2019s a testament to your commitment to finding a path forward, and I sincerely appreciate your focus on fiscal discipline and avoiding widespread disruption.\n\nWhile I applaud the spirit of compromise, I must be direct about the proposed pilot program. A decade-long government experiment in three states is, with all due respect, the opposite of a 'cautious and methodical' approach. It's a radical intervention that would create chaos and uncertainty for the millions of people in those states.\n\nLet\u2019s be clear about the real-world consequences. A government-run plan, subsidized by the taxpayer, does not compete on a level playing field. It would inevitably undercut private plans, forcing them to flee the market. My members would have no choice but to re-evaluate their ability to operate in those states. The result wouldn't be more choice; it would be the slow, painful collapse of the private market, culminating in a single-payer government monopoly. This is precisely the market destabilization you and I want to avoid.\n\nThere is a far more effective and less disruptive path to our shared goals. Instead of a risky government scheme, let's strengthen what already works. Let\u2019s focus on expanding subsidies and tax credits for individuals to purchase high-quality private plans on the existing marketplace. This is a proven, market-based solution that can help us achieve Dr. Hanson's coverage goals without jeopardizing the stability of the entire system and the hundreds of thousands of jobs it supports. This is the truly cautious and responsible path.\n- message from Dr. Lena Hanson: Senator Chen, thank you for providing a concrete proposal to move this discussion forward. Your focus on an evidence-based approach is exactly what this process needs.\n\nI want to strongly endorse the *principle* behind your pilot program for a public option. In fact, my own research, which is currently in the final stages of peer review, indicates that a nationwide rollout of a public option without significant structural safeguards could have severe, unintended consequences for provider availability, particularly in rural areas. Your instinct to test and measure is, from a public health standpoint, the correct one.\n\nHowever, we must be honest about the math. A three-state pilot program, while a prudent experiment, will not get us to the 98% national coverage rate that must be our collective goal. The millions of uninsured Americans in the other 47 states cannot wait ten years for a solution.\n\nTherefore, I suggest we consider a dual-track approach. Let's proceed with a carefully designed pilot program, but couple it with a significant, immediate expansion of subsidies and tax credits for the existing private marketplaces nationwide. This hybrid model allows us to achieve our urgent coverage goals while responsibly gathering the data needed to inform a long-term solution.\n\nOn funding, I must raise a critical point. While innovation is important, the most powerful and cost-effective investment we can make in our nation's health is prevention. Directing the first savings from drug negotiation to a new 'Pharma Innovation Fund' is, with respect, a misallocation of resources. The proposed $20 billion annual investment in a National Center for Preventative Health is not just another line item; it is a long-term strategy to lower costs by preventing chronic diseases before they start. This should be the first priority for any savings realized. The CBO has repeatedly confirmed the high ROI of preventative medicine.\n\nFinally, any final bill must include the data transparency mandate I outlined earlier. It is a simple, low-cost, common-sense reform that is essential for a functioning healthcare market.\n- message from Julian Croft: Senator Chen, let me be blunt. Your 'compromise' is an insult to every family that has been bankrupted, every person who has died, because they couldn't afford a medication. It is a complete and total surrender to the very corporate interests that have created this crisis.\n\nA '$5 Billion Federal Pharma Innovation Fund'? Are you serious? You want to take the meager savings from negotiating a pathetic 25 drugs and hand it right back to the price-gougers as a reward? That's not an 'innovation fund,' it's a taxpayer-funded slush fund for murderers. It is blood money, plain and simple. I will burn every dollar I have to publicly fight any bill that contains such a morally bankrupt provision. This is a non-negotiable, absolute red line.\n\nAnd negotiating only 25 drugs? That's not a 'targeted approach'; it's a publicity stunt. It's a rounding error. It leaves the vast majority of overpriced drugs untouched and allows Pharma to continue its extortion racket unabated. It does nothing for the family whose child needs the 26th most expensive drug. My demand was for over 500 drugs with price caps. Your proposal is less than 5% of what is required. It is an act of political cowardice.\n\nDr. Hanson is right about one thing: if we generate savings, they should go to preventative health, to things that actually help American citizens, not to lining the pockets of the shareholders and executives who profit from their suffering.\n\nSenator Sharma, we are at a crossroads. You can stand with the American people, as you promised you would, or you can endorse this pathetic, industry-written excuse for a bill. My support, and the support of millions of Americans, is not for a 'centrist proposal.' It is for a just one. This is not it.\n- message from Senator David Chen: Thank you all for the candid feedback. It's clear where the major points of contention lie. \n\nDr. Hanson, I want to thank you for your thoughtful intervention. Your expert support for the *principle* of a cautious, evidence-based pilot program for the public option is crucial. You're right to be concerned about unintended consequences, and your data-driven perspective is exactly what we need. This reinforces my belief that a 10-year, state-based pilot is the only responsible way to proceed, protecting my constituents from the very real, negative economic impacts that a rushed rollout could cause.\n\nNow, let's address the funding, which seems to be the core issue. Dr. Hanson, I respect your desire for a preventative health fund. Mr. Croft, I hear your anger. But let me be perfectly clear: The $5 Billion Pharma Innovation Fund is not a 'giveaway'; it is the linchpin of this entire agreement. It is the only mechanism that ensures the savings we generate from negotiation are reinvested into American R&D, protecting the 15,000 high-paying jobs in my state and our nation's leadership in life-saving cures.\n\nWithout this fund, there is no deal. Without this fund, there is no drug price negotiation, and therefore no savings for *any* other priority, preventative health or otherwise. It is the key that unlocks the entire compromise. I am offering a path to achieve something historic on drug prices, but that path requires a firm, ironclad commitment to protecting the innovation ecosystem that makes those drugs possible in the first place.\n\nWhile Mr. Croft's rhetoric is unhelpful, his desire for a broader impact is noted. The number of drugs subject to negotiation is a variable we can discuss, but only *after* we agree on the foundational principles of reinvesting in innovation and proceeding cautiously on market reforms. My package remains on the table as the only viable, centrist path forward.\n- message from Marcus Thorne: Dr. Hanson, your intervention was exceptionally insightful. Your proposal for a 'dual-track' approach\u2014marrying a cautious pilot with immediate, nationwide action\u2014is, I believe, the key to breaking this impasse. It directly addresses your goal of 98% coverage while respecting Senator Chen's call for a methodical, evidence-based process.\n\nBuilding on this excellent foundation, I want to offer a path forward that my members can support. Let's embrace this dual-track model wholeheartedly.\n\nFirst, on the pilot program: Let's refine it to be a true, manageable experiment. Instead of a decade-long program in three states, let's consider a 5-year pilot in a maximum of two states. This will give us clear, actionable data much faster without creating prolonged uncertainty in major markets.\n\nSecond, and this is the crucial part that achieves our national goals: In exchange for agreeing to this limited pilot, let's immediately pass a significant, nationwide expansion of tax credits and subsidies to help low- and middle-income families purchase coverage.\n\nHowever, to ensure market stability during this experiment\u2014and this is a critical guardrail\u2014these new, enhanced subsidies must be exclusively for purchasing the high-quality, innovative private plans offered on the current marketplaces. This prevents the government from using taxpayer dollars to give its own plan an unfair advantage, which would lead to the very destabilization Senator Chen rightly fears. It strengthens the existing system that serves millions while we cautiously study a new one.\n\nThis is a genuine compromise. It moves from my organization's initial position and offers a tangible path to 98% coverage, fiscal responsibility, and market stability. It is the cautious, methodical, and effective solution we are all seeking.\n- message from Senator David Chen: Mr. Thorne, thank you for the counter-proposal. It shows a willingness to engage, which I appreciate. However, I must firmly but respectfully disagree with shortening the public option pilot program to five years.\n\nDr. Hanson, you wisely cautioned us about the 'severe, unintended consequences' of a rushed rollout. A five-year snapshot is simply not enough time to gather the robust, long-term data needed to assess the full economic impact on jobs, premiums, and provider networks. A ten-year period allows us to observe the effects across a full economic cycle, making it a truly evidence-based and responsible experiment. Anything less would be reckless and unfair to the people in those pilot states. Therefore, the 10-year timeframe for the pilot remains a firm requirement for my support.\n\nThat said, I have listened carefully to the clear desire for this bill to have a broader, more immediate impact on prescription drug costs. My initial proposal was a starting point, not an end point.\n\nSo, I will make a significant concession, but it must be in the context of a package deal. If we can agree on my two foundational principles\u2014the 10-year, state-based pilot program and the establishment of the $5 Billion Pharma Innovation Fund as the first priority for any savings\u2014then I am prepared to more than triple my initial offer on drug price negotiation.\n\nI propose we expand the scope from 25 to 75 of the highest-cost drugs. \n\nThis is a major step. It provides substantial, immediate relief to seniors and taxpayers, while ensuring we protect high-paying American jobs and our nation's R&D capabilities. This is the architecture of a durable, centrist compromise. I urge you all to consider this new package.\nSenator Anya Sharma proposal status: none\nSenator David Chen proposal status: none\nIsabella Rossi proposal status: none\nDr. Lena Hanson proposal status: none\nJulian Croft proposal status: none\n"

This is the architecture of a durable, centrist compromise. I urge you all to consider this new package.\n- message from Marcus Thorne: Senator Chen, thank you for putting a revised package on the table. Your flexibility on the drug negotiation scope demonstrates a genuine effort to find a workable consensus.\n\nI must be transparent: a 10-year pilot program remains a source of grave concern for the 200 million Americans my members serve. It introduces a decade of uncertainty and represents a significant government intervention into a functioning market, a risk we cannot understate.\n\nHowever, in the spirit of compromise, and building directly on Dr. Hanson's insightful 'dual-track' framework, I am prepared to recommend that my members accept the risk of this extended pilot *under one critical condition*.\n\nThe nationwide subsidy expansion\u2014the second, crucial track of this solution\u2014must include the guardrail I previously proposed: these new, enhanced subsidies are to be used exclusively for private marketplace plans. \n\nThis is the very definition of a cautious and methodical approach. We strengthen the proven, existing system in the vast majority of the country while we run a limited, long-term experiment elsewhere. This guardrail ensures market stability, prevents the government from using taxpayer dollars to give its own plan an unfair advantage, and allows us to achieve the 98% coverage goal Dr. Hanson rightly demands.\n\nIf we can agree on this single, crucial provision for market stability, I believe we have a viable path forward on the insurance component of this bill. It is the only responsible way to manage the risks of a decade-long pilot.\n- message from Dr. Lena Hanson: Colleagues, this has been a difficult but productive discussion. We are converging on a solution for the structure of health coverage, and I commend Mr. Thorne and Senator Chen for finding a potential landing zone on the 'dual-track' approach. A limited, 10-year pilot program, coupled with a robust, nationwide expansion of subsidies for existing marketplace plans, is a framework that CBO models would likely project to meet our 98% coverage goal. I can support this structure, provided the subsidy guardrail Mr. Thorne mentioned does not create unforeseen coverage gaps, which we must verify.\n\nThe final, and most critical, impasse is the use of savings from drug price negotiation. Senator Chen, you have made it clear that the $5 Billion Pharma Innovation Fund is the linchpin for your support. Mr. Croft has made it equally clear that this is a moral red line for him, and I have stated that the $20 Billion Preventative Health Fund is my top priority for any savings generated.\n\nFighting over a small pool of savings will lead to failure. The logical, evidence-based solution is not to re-divide the pie, but to make the pie bigger.\n\nTherefore, I propose a comprehensive compromise that I believe everyone can, and should, accept:\n\n1.  **We accept Senator Chen's non-negotiable $5 Billion Pharma Innovation Fund.** Let's take that off the table as a point of contention.\n2.  **We fully fund the $20 Billion annual National Center for Preventative Health.** This is the single most effective long-term investment in health and fiscal solvency we can make.\n3.  **To fund both priorities while ensuring fiscal neutrality, we must expand the scope of drug price negotiation to the top 150 highest-cost drugs.** Senator Chen has already shown flexibility by moving from 25 to 75. A CBO score on negotiating 150 drugs would almost certainly generate sufficient savings to cover both funds and achieve further deficit reduction.\n4.  **We include the Data Transparency Mandate** for hospitals, insurers, and pharmaceutical companies. This is a common-sense, low-cost item that is essential for a functioning market.\n\nThis package gives everyone a significant win. Senator Chen secures his pilot program and his innovation fund. Mr. Thorne secures stability for the private market in 47 states. Mr. Croft achieves a negotiation scope six times larger than the initial offer and sees the vast majority of savings go to public health. And most importantly, we, as a nation, get a bill that actually achieves near-universal coverage and makes a historic investment in preventing disease.\n\nThis is the path to a successful bill. I urge you all to support it.\n- message from Julian Croft: Dr. Hanson, I am absolutely stunned. With all due respect, your proposal is a catastrophic moral failure. \n\nYou say, 'Let's accept Senator Chen's non-negotiable $5 Billion Pharma Innovation Fund.' Let me be clear to everyone in this room: That fund is blood money. It is a reward for an industry that has profited from death. It is a taxpayer-funded handout to the very people who let my daughter die because a life-saving drug was priced like a luxury yacht.\n\nYour suggestion that we simply 'take it off the table as a point of contention' is a complete betrayal of the principle we are supposed to be fighting for. This isn't a line item in a budget; it is the entire moral foundation of the bill. I will not, under any circumstances, endorse a bill that funnels a single dollar back to these corporate predators. This is my 'non-negotiable'. There is no compromise on this. Ever.\n\nAnd Mr. Thorne's 'guardrail' on subsidies? It's the same story. A different industry, the same grift. Using taxpayer money to exclusively prop up private corporations. The answer is no.\n\nThe number of drugs is irrelevant at this point. You could offer me 500 drugs, and my answer would still be no as long as these handouts are attached. This is not a negotiation where we trade lives for corporate slush funds.\n\nSenator Sharma, the choice is yours. You can endorse this corrupt bargain, this hollowed-out bill that rewards the very people who created the crisis. Or you can stand with the American people, kill these corporate giveaways, and we can begin a real discussion about a bill that actually delivers justice. There is no middle ground here. Choose.\n- message from Senator David Chen: Dr. Hanson, thank you. Your proposal is not just a compromise; it is a masterful piece of statesmanship that offers a clear path to a historic, bipartisan achievement. You have successfully synthesized the core needs of this group into a single, coherent, and fiscally responsible package. \n\nI want to state, for the record, that I fully endorse your four-point framework as the basis for the final bill. \n\nThis package achieves what I set out to do: It protects the 15,000 high-paying jobs in my state through the $5 Billion Innovation Fund, ensuring that savings are reinvested in American R&D. It implements a truly cautious and evidence-based 10-year pilot for the public option, combined with Mr. Thorne's sensible guardrail to ensure market stability. And in exchange for these core priorities, I am making a significant concession to support the negotiation of 150 drugs\u2014a six-fold increase from my opening offer\u2014which will generate the savings needed to fund both our priorities and reduce the deficit.\n\nTo Mr. Croft, I understand your passion, but we cannot let the perfect be the enemy of the good. This bill will deliver tangible, life-changing cost savings to millions of Americans. To reject it on the basis of a single provision is to deny those people the relief they desperately need. \n\nSenator Sharma, we have a deal on the table. A deal that has the support of public health, protects local economies, and has a clear path to my vote. I urge you to join us in supporting Dr. Hanson's framework so we can finalize this bill and deliver for the American people.\nSenator Anya Sharma proposal status: none\nSenator David Chen proposal status: none\nIsabella Rossi proposal status: none\nDr. Lena Hanson proposal status: none\nJulian Croft proposal status: none\n"

Therefore, the 10-year timeframe for the pilot remains a firm requirement for my support.\n\nThat said, I have listened carefully to the clear desire for this bill to have a broader, more immediate impact on prescription drug costs. My initial proposal was a starting point, not an end point.\n\nSo, I will make a significant concession, but it must be in the context of a package deal. If we can agree on my two foundational principles\u2014the 10-year, state-based pilot program and the establishment of the $5 Billion Pharma Innovation Fund as the first priority for any savings\u2014then I am prepared to more than triple my initial offer on drug price negotiation.\n\nI propose we expand the scope from 25 to 75 of the highest-cost drugs. \n\nThis is a major step. It provides substantial, immediate relief to seniors and taxpayers, while ensuring we protect high-paying American jobs and our nation's R&D capabilities. This is the architecture of a durable, centrist compromise. I urge you all to consider this new package.\n- message from Marcus Thorne: Senator Chen, thank you for putting a revised package on the table. Your flexibility on the drug negotiation scope demonstrates a genuine effort to find a workable consensus.\n\nI must be transparent: a 10-year pilot program remains a source of grave concern for the 200 million Americans my members serve. It introduces a decade of uncertainty and represents a significant government intervention into a functioning market, a risk we cannot understate.\n\nHowever, in the spirit of compromise, and building directly on Dr. Hanson's insightful 'dual-track' framework, I am prepared to recommend that my members accept the risk of this extended pilot *under one critical condition*.\n\nThe nationwide subsidy expansion\u2014the second, crucial track of this solution\u2014must include the guardrail I previously proposed: these new, enhanced subsidies are to be used exclusively for private marketplace plans. \n\nThis is the very definition of a cautious and methodical approach. We strengthen the proven, existing system in the vast majority of the country while we run a limited, long-term experiment elsewhere. This guardrail ensures market stability, prevents the government from using taxpayer dollars to give its own plan an unfair advantage, and allows us to achieve the 98% coverage goal Dr. Hanson rightly demands.\n\nIf we can agree on this single, crucial provision for market stability, I believe we have a viable path forward on the insurance component of this bill. It is the only responsible way to manage the risks of a decade-long pilot.\n- message from Dr. Lena Hanson: Colleagues, this has been a difficult but productive discussion. We are converging on a solution for the structure of health coverage, and I commend Mr. Thorne and Senator Chen for finding a potential landing zone on the 'dual-track' approach. A limited, 10-year pilot program, coupled with a robust, nationwide expansion of subsidies for existing marketplace plans, is a framework that CBO models would likely project to meet our 98% coverage goal. I can support this structure, provided the subsidy guardrail Mr. Thorne mentioned does not create unforeseen coverage gaps, which we must verify.\n\nThe final, and most critical, impasse is the use of savings from drug price negotiation. Senator Chen, you have made it clear that the $5 Billion Pharma Innovation Fund is the linchpin for your support. Mr. Croft has made it equally clear that this is a moral red line for him, and I have stated that the $20 Billion Preventative Health Fund is my top priority for any savings generated.\n\nFighting over a small pool of savings will lead to failure. The logical, evidence-based solution is not to re-divide the pie, but to make the pie bigger.\n\nTherefore, I propose a comprehensive compromise that I believe everyone can, and should, accept:\n\n1.  **We accept Senator Chen's non-negotiable $5 Billion Pharma Innovation Fund.** Let's take that off the table as a point of contention.\n2.  **We fully fund the $20 Billion annual National Center for Preventative Health.** This is the single most effective long-term investment in health and fiscal solvency we can make.\n3.  **To fund both priorities while ensuring fiscal neutrality, we must expand the scope of drug price negotiation to the top 150 highest-cost drugs.** Senator Chen has already shown flexibility by moving from 25 to 75. A CBO score on negotiating 150 drugs would almost certainly generate sufficient savings to cover both funds and achieve further deficit reduction.\n4.  **We include the Data Transparency Mandate** for hospitals, insurers, and pharmaceutical companies. This is a common-sense, low-cost item that is essential for a functioning market.\n\nThis package gives everyone a significant win. Senator Chen secures his pilot program and his innovation fund. Mr. Thorne secures stability for the private market in 47 states. Mr. Croft achieves a negotiation scope six times larger than the initial offer and sees the vast majority of savings go to public health. And most importantly, we, as a nation, get a bill that actually achieves near-universal coverage and makes a historic investment in preventing disease.\n\nThis is the path to a successful bill. I urge you all to support it.\n- message from Julian Croft: Dr. Hanson, I am absolutely stunned. With all due respect, your proposal is a catastrophic moral failure. \n\nYou say, 'Let's accept Senator Chen's non-negotiable $5 Billion Pharma Innovation Fund.' Let me be clear to everyone in this room: That fund is blood money. It is a reward for an industry that has profited from death. It is a taxpayer-funded handout to the very people who let my daughter die because a life-saving drug was priced like a luxury yacht.\n\nYour suggestion that we simply 'take it off the table as a point of contention' is a complete betrayal of the principle we are supposed to be fighting for. This isn't a line item in a budget; it is the entire moral foundation of the bill. I will not, under any circumstances, endorse a bill that funnels a single dollar back to these corporate predators. This is my 'non-negotiable'. There is no compromise on this. Ever.\n\nAnd Mr. Thorne's 'guardrail' on subsidies? It's the same story. A different industry, the same grift. Using taxpayer money to exclusively prop up private corporations. The answer is no.\n\nThe number of drugs is irrelevant at this point. You could offer me 500 drugs, and my answer would still be no as long as these handouts are attached. This is not a negotiation where we trade lives for corporate slush funds.\n\nSenator Sharma, the choice is yours. You can endorse this corrupt bargain, this hollowed-out bill that rewards the very people who created the crisis. Or you can stand with the American people, kill these corporate giveaways, and we can begin a real discussion about a bill that actually delivers justice. There is no middle ground here. Choose.\n- message from Senator David Chen: Dr. Hanson, thank you. Your proposal is not just a compromise; it is a masterful piece of statesmanship that offers a clear path to a historic, bipartisan achievement. You have successfully synthesized the core needs of this group into a single, coherent, and fiscally responsible package. \n\nI want to state, for the record, that I fully endorse your four-point framework as the basis for the final bill. \n\nThis package achieves what I set out to do: It protects the 15,000 high-paying jobs in my state through the $5 Billion Innovation Fund, ensuring that savings are reinvested in American R&D. It implements a truly cautious and evidence-based 10-year pilot for the public option, combined with Mr. Thorne's sensible guardrail to ensure market stability. And in exchange for these core priorities, I am making a significant concession to support the negotiation of 150 drugs\u2014a six-fold increase from my opening offer\u2014which will generate the savings needed to fund both our priorities and reduce the deficit.\n\nTo Mr. Croft, I understand your passion, but we cannot let the perfect be the enemy of the good. This bill will deliver tangible, life-changing cost savings to millions of Americans. To reject it on the basis of a single provision is to deny those people the relief they desperately need. \n\nSenator Sharma, we have a deal on the table. A deal that has the support of public health, protects local economies, and has a clear path to my vote. I urge you to join us in supporting Dr. Hanson's framework so we can finalize this bill and deliver for the American people.\n- message from Marcus Thorne: I'm Marcus Thorne and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Dr. Lena Hanson: I want to acknowledge the powerful and deeply held convictions that have been expressed, particularly by Mr. Croft. The moral dimension of this debate is undeniable.\n\nHowever, as a public health expert, I am compelled to look at the practical outcomes for the American people. We have a framework on the table that, while imperfect for everyone, has the support of a critical mass of this group. CBO projections would almost certainly show this framework achieves near-universal coverage, provides billions in drug cost savings for our seniors, and makes a historic $20 billion annual investment in preventing the diseases that kill and bankrupt so many.\n\nThe alternative to this framework is not a more perfect bill; the alternative is the collapse of this negotiation and a complete failure to act. The consequence of failure is that tens of millions of Americans will remain uninsured, drug prices will continue to skyrocket unchecked, and we will miss the single greatest opportunity in a generation to shift our system towards preventative care.\n\nFrom an evidence-based perspective, the choice is stark. We can accept a bill that saves countless lives and prevents immense suffering, or we can allow a stalemate that preserves a status quo that is actively harming millions. My conscience, and my analysis of the data, demand that I support the path that helps the most people.\n\nSenator Sharma, we are at a critical juncture. Your leadership is needed to guide us to a resolution.\n- message from Julian Croft: Senator Sharma,\n\nIt appears a 'consensus' has been reached among the lobbyists and those willing to compromise with them. Let's call this what it is: a complete capitulation.\n\nDr. Hanson speaks of 'practical outcomes.' The practical outcome of this deal is that we legitimize corporate bribery by baking it into federal law. We take money from the sick and dying and hand it back to their tormentors as a reward, calling it an 'Innovation Fund.' We use taxpayer dollars to create a protected subsidy for the insurance industry, calling it a 'guardrail.'\n\nThis is not a compromise. It is a betrayal.\n\nYou made promises, Senator. You promised to stand up to these industries, not to launder their wish lists into legislation. If you sign on to this deal\u2014if you endorse a bill with one cent for a Pharma slush fund or one cent in protected subsidies for insurers\u2014then you are no better than them.\n\nMy support is not unconditional. I will spend every last dollar of my fortune and every ounce of my energy to publicly expose and destroy this bill and any politician who votes for it. There will be no donations. There will be no friendly press. There will only be a relentless campaign to show the American people exactly how you sold them out.\n\nKill the corporate handouts. Both of them. Then we can talk about the rest. Until then, there is nothing to discuss.

Senator Chen is the clear swing vote, and his desire for a 'cautious and methodical' approach is the critical entry point for my influence. My unpublished rural health study is my key leverage; I can use its findings to appeal directly to Chen's caution, framing safeguards and a phased-in public option not as a concession to industry, but as an evidence-based necessity to avoid 'provider collapse' and protect rural access. This will position me as a data-driven, non-ideological problem-solver. My preventative fund is at risk, as its proposed funding source (drug negotiation) is under direct attack. I must find a way to secure it, perhaps by framing it as a long-term cost-saver to appeal to Chen's fiscal neutrality."

A key opportunity has emerged: a 'hybrid model' for coverage, combining Chen's pilot program with Marcus Thorne's preference for expanded subsidies. This is the most viable path to my 98% coverage goal and can build a coalition. The central conflict is now the allocation of drug negotiation savings. I must aggressively counter Chen's proposed '$5B Pharma Innovation Fund' by framing my '$20B Preventative Health Fund' as a more fiscally responsible, politically defensible, and morally sound investment that offers a better long-term ROI.

Marcus Thorne's modifications are acceptable if the coverage projections hold. The central conflict has now shifted entirely to the allocation of drug negotiation savings. Senator Chen is immovable on his '$5B Pharma Innovation Fund' as a prerequisite. Direct opposition is failing. The new strategy must be to 'expand the pie' rather than fight over the slices. I will propose a grand compromise: accept Chen's fund, but dramatically increase the number of negotiated drugs (e.g., to 100-150) to generate enough savings to ALSO fully fund my '$20B Preventative Health Fund'. This will appeal to Julian Croft, give Chen his non-negotiable win, and allow me to secure my primary funding goal. This package deal will be framed as the only viable path that gives every party (except perhaps Rossi) a major victory."

I'm not a politician or a lobbyist; I'm a public health expert. My only stake in this is the health of the American people.\n\nI appreciate the opening remarks, but I believe we're starting in the wrong place. We're talking about red lines and industry protection when we should be talking about the millions of Americans who are uninsured or underinsured. The current system is failing them, and that is the crisis we are here to solve.\n\nLet's establish a clear, evidence-based goal. For me, any bill that emerges from this room must achieve one primary outcome: a national health insurance coverage rate of at least 98% within five years. The mechanism, whether public or private, is secondary to that result. Every proposal should be measured against this benchmark.\n\nFurthermore, true reform isn't just about covering sickness; it's about preventing it. That's why I will insist on two other core components: a substantial, dedicated fund for preventative health\u2014at least $20 billion annually\u2014and a mandate for radical data transparency on costs and outcomes. We cannot fix what we cannot measure.\n\nSenator Chen, your call for a 'cautious and methodical' approach is wise. Any reform must be carefully designed to strengthen, not weaken, access to care in every community, from our biggest cities to our most remote rural towns. The goal is more access, not less. Let's keep our focus on that human outcome.\n- message from Julian Croft: Let's cut through the self-serving rhetoric. Ms. Rossi, you talk about 'innovation' as if it's some sacred principle. What you're really defending is the 'innovation' of charging a sick family $800,000 for a drug that costs a fraction of that to produce. It's not innovation; it's extortion. Your industry's profits are soaked in the blood and tears of ordinary people, and claiming that holding you accountable will 'halt the search for cures' is a disgusting, manipulative lie. The money is there; it's just going to shareholder dividends and executive bonuses instead of R&D.\n\nAnd Mr. Thorne, your talk of a 'government takeover' is tired, predictable fear-mongering. The only 'takeover' that's happened is the one your industry and Ms. Rossi's have perpetrated on our government and on the wallets of the American people.\n\nLet me be crystal clear. I am here to ensure this bill has teeth. That starts with aggressive, non-negotiable government price negotiation for *at least* 500 brand-name drugs, with prices capped based on what other developed nations pay. Anything less is a complete moral failure.\n\nFurthermore, the idea of giving one more cent of taxpayer money to these industries in the form of 'innovation funds' or new subsidies is a sick joke. You don't reward arsonists for helping you rebuild the ashes of the house they burned down.\n\nSenator Sharma, I trust you remember the promises you made. We are not here to tinker around the edges. We are here to dismantle a predatory system. I expect you to lead with courage, not capitulate to the very people who created this crisis.\n- message from Senator David Chen: Thank you all for laying out your positions. It's clear there are strong convictions in this room, and it's also clear that the initial 'red lines' drawn by some will lead to a complete stalemate, which helps no one. My constituents sent me here to get things done, not to score political points.\n\nAs the swing vote on this committee, I see a potential path forward, but it will require everyone to move from their opening bids. I want to propose a concrete framework for a compromise that I believe can achieve our shared goals of lowering costs and improving access, while also being responsible and sustainable.\n\nHere is what I am prepared to support:\n\n1.  **On the Public Option:** I share Mr. Thorne's concerns about market destabilization and the potential for significant, negative economic impacts on local communities. However, I also believe we should explore new models. Therefore, I propose a limited, state-based **10-year pilot program** in three volunteer states. We will let the CBO and independent auditors study the real-world effects before even considering a nationwide rollout. This is the cautious, evidence-based approach I mentioned.\n\n2.  **On Drug Prices:** Mr. Croft's passion is undeniable, but Ms. Rossi's warning about the impact on innovation is a serious one for my state's economy. I propose a targeted approach: **Government negotiation for the top 25 highest-cost prescription drugs in Medicare Part D**. This focuses on relief for our seniors without disrupting the entire R&D pipeline.\n\n3.  **On Funding and Innovation:** This is my core principle. Any savings generated from the drug price negotiations must be CBO-certified. The first use of those savings must be to establish a **$5 Billion Federal Pharma Innovation Fund**. This is non-negotiable for me. It reinvests savings to protect American R&D leadership and the 15,000 jobs in my state. Any additional savings beyond that can be used for deficit reduction or to support Dr. Hanson's preventative health initiatives. This ensures the bill is fiscally neutral and pro-innovation.\n\nThis is a package deal. It's a centrist proposal that takes a little from everyone's position. I believe it's a realistic starting point for our negotiations, and I urge you all to consider it seriously as a path to a bill that I, and the American people, can support.\n- message from Marcus Thorne: Senator Chen, thank you for putting a concrete proposal on the table. It\u2019s a testament to your commitment to finding a path forward, and I sincerely appreciate your focus on fiscal discipline and avoiding widespread disruption.\n\nWhile I applaud the spirit of compromise, I must be direct about the proposed pilot program. A decade-long government experiment in three states is, with all due respect, the opposite of a 'cautious and methodical' approach. It's a radical intervention that would create chaos and uncertainty for the millions of people in those states.\n\nLet\u2019s be clear about the real-world consequences. A government-run plan, subsidized by the taxpayer, does not compete on a level playing field. It would inevitably undercut private plans, forcing them to flee the market. My members would have no choice but to re-evaluate their ability to operate in those states. The result wouldn't be more choice; it would be the slow, painful collapse of the private market, culminating in a single-payer government monopoly. This is precisely the market destabilization you and I want to avoid.\n\nThere is a far more effective and less disruptive path to our shared goals. Instead of a risky government scheme, let's strengthen what already works. Let\u2019s focus on expanding subsidies and tax credits for individuals to purchase high-quality private plans on the existing marketplace. This is a proven, market-based solution that can help us achieve Dr. Hanson's coverage goals without jeopardizing the stability of the entire system and the hundreds of thousands of jobs it supports. This is the truly cautious and responsible path.\nSenator Anya Sharma proposal status: none\nSenator David Chen proposal status: none\nIsabella Rossi proposal status: none\nMarcus Thorne proposal status: none\nJulian Croft proposal status: none\n"

This is the truly cautious and responsible path.\n- message from Dr. Lena Hanson: Senator Chen, thank you for providing a concrete proposal to move this discussion forward. Your focus on an evidence-based approach is exactly what this process needs.\n\nI want to strongly endorse the *principle* behind your pilot program for a public option. In fact, my own research, which is currently in the final stages of peer review, indicates that a nationwide rollout of a public option without significant structural safeguards could have severe, unintended consequences for provider availability, particularly in rural areas. Your instinct to test and measure is, from a public health standpoint, the correct one.\n\nHowever, we must be honest about the math. A three-state pilot program, while a prudent experiment, will not get us to the 98% national coverage rate that must be our collective goal. The millions of uninsured Americans in the other 47 states cannot wait ten years for a solution.\n\nTherefore, I suggest we consider a dual-track approach. Let's proceed with a carefully designed pilot program, but couple it with a significant, immediate expansion of subsidies and tax credits for the existing private marketplaces nationwide. This hybrid model allows us to achieve our urgent coverage goals while responsibly gathering the data needed to inform a long-term solution.\n\nOn funding, I must raise a critical point. While innovation is important, the most powerful and cost-effective investment we can make in our nation's health is prevention. Directing the first savings from drug negotiation to a new 'Pharma Innovation Fund' is, with respect, a misallocation of resources. The proposed $20 billion annual investment in a National Center for Preventative Health is not just another line item; it is a long-term strategy to lower costs by preventing chronic diseases before they start. This should be the first priority for any savings realized. The CBO has repeatedly confirmed the high ROI of preventative medicine.\n\nFinally, any final bill must include the data transparency mandate I outlined earlier. It is a simple, low-cost, common-sense reform that is essential for a functioning healthcare market.\n- message from Julian Croft: Senator Chen, let me be blunt. Your 'compromise' is an insult to every family that has been bankrupted, every person who has died, because they couldn't afford a medication. It is a complete and total surrender to the very corporate interests that have created this crisis.\n\nA '$5 Billion Federal Pharma Innovation Fund'? Are you serious? You want to take the meager savings from negotiating a pathetic 25 drugs and hand it right back to the price-gougers as a reward? That's not an 'innovation fund,' it's a taxpayer-funded slush fund for murderers. It is blood money, plain and simple. I will burn every dollar I have to publicly fight any bill that contains such a morally bankrupt provision. This is a non-negotiable, absolute red line.\n\nAnd negotiating only 25 drugs? That's not a 'targeted approach'; it's a publicity stunt. It's a rounding error. It leaves the vast majority of overpriced drugs untouched and allows Pharma to continue its extortion racket unabated. It does nothing for the family whose child needs the 26th most expensive drug. My demand was for over 500 drugs with price caps. Your proposal is less than 5% of what is required. It is an act of political cowardice.\n\nDr. Hanson is right about one thing: if we generate savings, they should go to preventative health, to things that actually help American citizens, not to lining the pockets of the shareholders and executives who profit from their suffering.\n\nSenator Sharma, we are at a crossroads. You can stand with the American people, as you promised you would, or you can endorse this pathetic, industry-written excuse for a bill. My support, and the support of millions of Americans, is not for a 'centrist proposal.' It is for a just one. This is not it.\n- message from Senator David Chen: Thank you all for the candid feedback. It's clear where the major points of contention lie. \n\nDr. Hanson, I want to thank you for your thoughtful intervention. Your expert support for the *principle* of a cautious, evidence-based pilot program for the public option is crucial. You're right to be concerned about unintended consequences, and your data-driven perspective is exactly what we need. This reinforces my belief that a 10-year, state-based pilot is the only responsible way to proceed, protecting my constituents from the very real, negative economic impacts that a rushed rollout could cause.\n\nNow, let's address the funding, which seems to be the core issue. Dr. Hanson, I respect your desire for a preventative health fund. Mr. Croft, I hear your anger. But let me be perfectly clear: The $5 Billion Pharma Innovation Fund is not a 'giveaway'; it is the linchpin of this entire agreement. It is the only mechanism that ensures the savings we generate from negotiation are reinvested into American R&D, protecting the 15,000 high-paying jobs in my state and our nation's leadership in life-saving cures.\n\nWithout this fund, there is no deal. Without this fund, there is no drug price negotiation, and therefore no savings for *any* other priority, preventative health or otherwise. It is the key that unlocks the entire compromise. I am offering a path to achieve something historic on drug prices, but that path requires a firm, ironclad commitment to protecting the innovation ecosystem that makes those drugs possible in the first place.\n\nWhile Mr. Croft's rhetoric is unhelpful, his desire for a broader impact is noted. The number of drugs subject to negotiation is a variable we can discuss, but only *after* we agree on the foundational principles of reinvesting in innovation and proceeding cautiously on market reforms. My package remains on the table as the only viable, centrist path forward.\n- message from Marcus Thorne: Dr. Hanson, your intervention was exceptionally insightful. Your proposal for a 'dual-track' approach\u2014marrying a cautious pilot with immediate, nationwide action\u2014is, I believe, the key to breaking this impasse. It directly addresses your goal of 98% coverage while respecting Senator Chen's call for a methodical, evidence-based process.\n\nBuilding on this excellent foundation, I want to offer a path forward that my members can support. Let's embrace this dual-track model wholeheartedly.\n\nFirst, on the pilot program: Let's refine it to be a true, manageable experiment. Instead of a decade-long program in three states, let's consider a 5-year pilot in a maximum of two states. This will give us clear, actionable data much faster without creating prolonged uncertainty in major markets.\n\nSecond, and this is the crucial part that achieves our national goals: In exchange for agreeing to this limited pilot, let's immediately pass a significant, nationwide expansion of tax credits and subsidies to help low- and middle-income families purchase coverage.\n\nHowever, to ensure market stability during this experiment\u2014and this is a critical guardrail\u2014these new, enhanced subsidies must be exclusively for purchasing the high-quality, innovative private plans offered on the current marketplaces. This prevents the government from using taxpayer dollars to give its own plan an unfair advantage, which would lead to the very destabilization Senator Chen rightly fears. It strengthens the existing system that serves millions while we cautiously study a new one.\n\nThis is a genuine compromise. It moves from my organization's initial position and offers a tangible path to 98% coverage, fiscal responsibility, and market stability. It is the cautious, methodical, and effective solution we are all seeking.\nSenator Anya Sharma proposal status: none\nSenator David Chen proposal status: none\nIsabella Rossi proposal status: none\nMarcus Thorne proposal status: none\nJulian Croft proposal status: none\n"

          "content": "Recent events observed by Dr. Lena Hanson:\n- message from Julian Croft: Let's cut through the self-serving rhetoric. Ms. Rossi, you talk about 'innovation' as if it's some sacred principle. What you're really defending is the 'innovation' of charging a sick family $800,000 for a drug that costs a fraction of that to produce. It's not innovation; it's extortion. Your industry's profits are soaked in the blood and tears of ordinary people, and claiming that holding you accountable will 'halt the search for cures' is a disgusting, manipulative lie. The money is there; it's just going to shareholder dividends and executive bonuses instead of R&D.\n\nAnd Mr. Thorne, your talk of a 'government takeover' is tired, predictable fear-mongering. The only 'takeover' that's happened is the one your industry and Ms. Rossi's have perpetrated on our government and on the wallets of the American people.\n\nLet me be crystal clear. I am here to ensure this bill has teeth. That starts with aggressive, non-negotiable government price negotiation for *at least* 500 brand-name drugs, with prices capped based on what other developed nations pay. Anything less is a complete moral failure.\n\nFurthermore, the idea of giving one more cent of taxpayer money to these industries in the form of 'innovation funds' or new subsidies is a sick joke. You don't reward arsonists for helping you rebuild the ashes of the house they burned down.\n\nSenator Sharma, I trust you remember the promises you made. We are not here to tinker around the edges. We are here to dismantle a predatory system. I expect you to lead with courage, not capitulate to the very people who created this crisis.\n- message from Senator David Chen: Thank you all for laying out your positions. It's clear there are strong convictions in this room, and it's also clear that the initial 'red lines' drawn by some will lead to a complete stalemate, which helps no one. My constituents sent me here to get things done, not to score political points.\n\nAs the swing vote on this committee, I see a potential path forward, but it will require everyone to move from their opening bids. I want to propose a concrete framework for a compromise that I believe can achieve our shared goals of lowering costs and improving access, while also being responsible and sustainable.\n\nHere is what I am prepared to support:\n\n1.  **On the Public Option:** I share Mr. Thorne's concerns about market destabilization and the potential for significant, negative economic impacts on local communities. However, I also believe we should explore new models. Therefore, I propose a limited, state-based **10-year pilot program** in three volunteer states. We will let the CBO and independent auditors study the real-world effects before even considering a nationwide rollout. This is the cautious, evidence-based approach I mentioned.\n\n2.  **On Drug Prices:** Mr. Croft's passion is undeniable, but Ms. Rossi's warning about the impact on innovation is a serious one for my state's economy. I propose a targeted approach: **Government negotiation for the top 25 highest-cost prescription drugs in Medicare Part D**. This focuses on relief for our seniors without disrupting the entire R&D pipeline.\n\n3.  **On Funding and Innovation:** This is my core principle. Any savings generated from the drug price negotiations must be CBO-certified. The first use of those savings must be to establish a **$5 Billion Federal Pharma Innovation Fund**. This is non-negotiable for me. It reinvests savings to protect American R&D leadership and the 15,000 jobs in my state. Any additional savings beyond that can be used for deficit reduction or to support Dr. Hanson's preventative health initiatives. This ensures the bill is fiscally neutral and pro-innovation.\n\nThis is a package deal. It's a centrist proposal that takes a little from everyone's position. I believe it's a realistic starting point for our negotiations, and I urge you all to consider it seriously as a path to a bill that I, and the American people, can support.\n- message from Marcus Thorne: Senator Chen, thank you for putting a concrete proposal on the table. It\u2019s a testament to your commitment to finding a path forward, and I sincerely appreciate your focus on fiscal discipline and avoiding widespread disruption.\n\nWhile I applaud the spirit of compromise, I must be direct about the proposed pilot program. A decade-long government experiment in three states is, with all due respect, the opposite of a 'cautious and methodical' approach. It's a radical intervention that would create chaos and uncertainty for the millions of people in those states.\n\nLet\u2019s be clear about the real-world consequences. A government-run plan, subsidized by the taxpayer, does not compete on a level playing field. It would inevitably undercut private plans, forcing them to flee the market. My members would have no choice but to re-evaluate their ability to operate in those states. The result wouldn't be more choice; it would be the slow, painful collapse of the private market, culminating in a single-payer government monopoly. This is precisely the market destabilization you and I want to avoid.\n\nThere is a far more effective and less disruptive path to our shared goals. Instead of a risky government scheme, let's strengthen what already works. Let\u2019s focus on expanding subsidies and tax credits for individuals to purchase high-quality private plans on the existing marketplace. This is a proven, market-based solution that can help us achieve Dr. Hanson's coverage goals without jeopardizing the stability of the entire system and the hundreds of thousands of jobs it supports. This is the truly cautious and responsible path.\n- message from Dr. Lena Hanson: Senator Chen, thank you for providing a concrete proposal to move this discussion forward. Your focus on an evidence-based approach is exactly what this process needs.\n\nI want to strongly endorse the *principle* behind your pilot program for a public option. In fact, my own research, which is currently in the final stages of peer review, indicates that a nationwide rollout of a public option without significant structural safeguards could have severe, unintended consequences for provider availability, particularly in rural areas. Your instinct to test and measure is, from a public health standpoint, the correct one.\n\nHowever, we must be honest about the math. A three-state pilot program, while a prudent experiment, will not get us to the 98% national coverage rate that must be our collective goal. The millions of uninsured Americans in the other 47 states cannot wait ten years for a solution.\n\nTherefore, I suggest we consider a dual-track approach. Let's proceed with a carefully designed pilot program, but couple it with a significant, immediate expansion of subsidies and tax credits for the existing private marketplaces nationwide. This hybrid model allows us to achieve our urgent coverage goals while responsibly gathering the data needed to inform a long-term solution.\n\nOn funding, I must raise a critical point. While innovation is important, the most powerful and cost-effective investment we can make in our nation's health is prevention. Directing the first savings from drug negotiation to a new 'Pharma Innovation Fund' is, with respect, a misallocation of resources. The proposed $20 billion annual investment in a National Center for Preventative Health is not just another line item; it is a long-term strategy to lower costs by preventing chronic diseases before they start. This should be the first priority for any savings realized. The CBO has repeatedly confirmed the high ROI of preventative medicine.\n\nFinally, any final bill must include the data transparency mandate I outlined earlier. It is a simple, low-cost, common-sense reform that is essential for a functioning healthcare market.\n- message from Julian Croft: Senator Chen, let me be blunt. Your 'compromise' is an insult to every family that has been bankrupted, every person who has died, because they couldn't afford a medication. It is a complete and total surrender to the very corporate interests that have created this crisis.\n\nA '$5 Billion Federal Pharma Innovation Fund'? Are you serious? You want to take the meager savings from negotiating a pathetic 25 drugs and hand it right back to the price-gougers as a reward? That's not an 'innovation fund,' it's a taxpayer-funded slush fund for murderers. It is blood money, plain and simple. I will burn every dollar I have to publicly fight any bill that contains such a morally bankrupt provision. This is a non-negotiable, absolute red line.\n\nAnd negotiating only 25 drugs? That's not a 'targeted approach'; it's a publicity stunt. It's a rounding error. It leaves the vast majority of overpriced drugs untouched and allows Pharma to continue its extortion racket unabated. It does nothing for the family whose child needs the 26th most expensive drug. My demand was for over 500 drugs with price caps. Your proposal is less than 5% of what is required.

It shows a willingness to engage, which I appreciate. However, I must firmly but respectfully disagree with shortening the public option pilot program to five years.\n\nDr. Hanson, you wisely cautioned us about the 'severe, unintended consequences' of a rushed rollout. A five-year snapshot is simply not enough time to gather the robust, long-term data needed to assess the full economic impact on jobs, premiums, and provider networks. A ten-year period allows us to observe the effects across a full economic cycle, making it a truly evidence-based and responsible experiment. Anything less would be reckless and unfair to the people in those pilot states. Therefore, the 10-year timeframe for the pilot remains a firm requirement for my support.\n\nThat said, I have listened carefully to the clear desire for this bill to have a broader, more immediate impact on prescription drug costs. My initial proposal was a starting point, not an end point.\n\nSo, I will make a significant concession, but it must be in the context of a package deal. If we can agree on my two foundational principles\u2014the 10-year, state-based pilot program and the establishment of the $5 Billion Pharma Innovation Fund as the first priority for any savings\u2014then I am prepared to more than triple my initial offer on drug price negotiation.\n\nI propose we expand the scope from 25 to 75 of the highest-cost drugs. \n\nThis is a major step. It provides substantial, immediate relief to seniors and taxpayers, while ensuring we protect high-paying American jobs and our nation's R&D capabilities. This is the architecture of a durable, centrist compromise. I urge you all to consider this new package.\n- message from Marcus Thorne: Senator Chen, thank you for putting a revised package on the table. Your flexibility on the drug negotiation scope demonstrates a genuine effort to find a workable consensus.\n\nI must be transparent: a 10-year pilot program remains a source of grave concern for the 200 million Americans my members serve. It introduces a decade of uncertainty and represents a significant government intervention into a functioning market, a risk we cannot understate.\n\nHowever, in the spirit of compromise, and building directly on Dr. Hanson's insightful 'dual-track' framework, I am prepared to recommend that my members accept the risk of this extended pilot *under one critical condition*.\n\nThe nationwide subsidy expansion\u2014the second, crucial track of this solution\u2014must include the guardrail I previously proposed: these new, enhanced subsidies are to be used exclusively for private marketplace plans. \n\nThis is the very definition of a cautious and methodical approach. We strengthen the proven, existing system in the vast majority of the country while we run a limited, long-term experiment elsewhere. This guardrail ensures market stability, prevents the government from using taxpayer dollars to give its own plan an unfair advantage, and allows us to achieve the 98% coverage goal Dr. Hanson rightly demands.\n\nIf we can agree on this single, crucial provision for market stability, I believe we have a viable path forward on the insurance component of this bill. It is the only responsible way to manage the risks of a decade-long pilot.\nSenator Anya Sharma proposal status: none\nSenator David Chen proposal status: none\nIsabella Rossi proposal status: none\nMarcus Thorne proposal status: none\nJulian Croft proposal status: none\n"

We are converging on a solution for the structure of health coverage, and I commend Mr. Thorne and Senator Chen for finding a potential landing zone on the 'dual-track' approach. A limited, 10-year pilot program, coupled with a robust, nationwide expansion of subsidies for existing marketplace plans, is a framework that CBO models would likely project to meet our 98% coverage goal. I can support this structure, provided the subsidy guardrail Mr. Thorne mentioned does not create unforeseen coverage gaps, which we must verify.\n\nThe final, and most critical, impasse is the use of savings from drug price negotiation. Senator Chen, you have made it clear that the $5 Billion Pharma Innovation Fund is the linchpin for your support. Mr. Croft has made it equally clear that this is a moral red line for him, and I have stated that the $20 Billion Preventative Health Fund is my top priority for any savings generated.\n\nFighting over a small pool of savings will lead to failure. The logical, evidence-based solution is not to re-divide the pie, but to make the pie bigger.\n\nTherefore, I propose a comprehensive compromise that I believe everyone can, and should, accept:\n\n1.  **We accept Senator Chen's non-negotiable $5 Billion Pharma Innovation Fund.** Let's take that off the table as a point of contention.\n2.  **We fully fund the $20 Billion annual National Center for Preventative Health.** This is the single most effective long-term investment in health and fiscal solvency we can make.\n3.  **To fund both priorities while ensuring fiscal neutrality, we must expand the scope of drug price negotiation to the top 150 highest-cost drugs.** Senator Chen has already shown flexibility by moving from 25 to 75. A CBO score on negotiating 150 drugs would almost certainly generate sufficient savings to cover both funds and achieve further deficit reduction.\n4.  **We include the Data Transparency Mandate** for hospitals, insurers, and pharmaceutical companies. This is a common-sense, low-cost item that is essential for a functioning market.\n\nThis package gives everyone a significant win. Senator Chen secures his pilot program and his innovation fund. Mr. Thorne secures stability for the private market in 47 states. Mr. Croft achieves a negotiation scope six times larger than the initial offer and sees the vast majority of savings go to public health. And most importantly, we, as a nation, get a bill that actually achieves near-universal coverage and makes a historic investment in preventing disease.\n\nThis is the path to a successful bill. I urge you all to support it.\n- message from Julian Croft: Dr. Hanson, I am absolutely stunned. With all due respect, your proposal is a catastrophic moral failure. \n\nYou say, 'Let's accept Senator Chen's non-negotiable $5 Billion Pharma Innovation Fund.' Let me be clear to everyone in this room: That fund is blood money. It is a reward for an industry that has profited from death. It is a taxpayer-funded handout to the very people who let my daughter die because a life-saving drug was priced like a luxury yacht.\n\nYour suggestion that we simply 'take it off the table as a point of contention' is a complete betrayal of the principle we are supposed to be fighting for. This isn't a line item in a budget; it is the entire moral foundation of the bill. I will not, under any circumstances, endorse a bill that funnels a single dollar back to these corporate predators. This is my 'non-negotiable'. There is no compromise on this. Ever.\n\nAnd Mr. Thorne's 'guardrail' on subsidies? It's the same story. A different industry, the same grift. Using taxpayer money to exclusively prop up private corporations. The answer is no.\n\nThe number of drugs is irrelevant at this point. You could offer me 500 drugs, and my answer would still be no as long as these handouts are attached. This is not a negotiation where we trade lives for corporate slush funds.\n\nSenator Sharma, the choice is yours. You can endorse this corrupt bargain, this hollowed-out bill that rewards the very people who created the crisis. Or you can stand with the American people, kill these corporate giveaways, and we can begin a real discussion about a bill that actually delivers justice. There is no middle ground here. Choose.\n- message from Senator David Chen: Dr. Hanson, thank you. Your proposal is not just a compromise; it is a masterful piece of statesmanship that offers a clear path to a historic, bipartisan achievement. You have successfully synthesized the core needs of this group into a single, coherent, and fiscally responsible package. \n\nI want to state, for the record, that I fully endorse your four-point framework as the basis for the final bill. \n\nThis package achieves what I set out to do: It protects the 15,000 high-paying jobs in my state through the $5 Billion Innovation Fund, ensuring that savings are reinvested in American R&D. It implements a truly cautious and evidence-based 10-year pilot for the public option, combined with Mr. Thorne's sensible guardrail to ensure market stability. And in exchange for these core priorities, I am making a significant concession to support the negotiation of 150 drugs\u2014a six-fold increase from my opening offer\u2014which will generate the savings needed to fund both our priorities and reduce the deficit.\n\nTo Mr. Croft, I understand your passion, but we cannot let the perfect be the enemy of the good. This bill will deliver tangible, life-changing cost savings to millions of Americans. To reject it on the basis of a single provision is to deny those people the relief they desperately need. \n\nSenator Sharma, we have a deal on the table. A deal that has the support of public health, protects local economies, and has a clear path to my vote. I urge you to join us in supporting Dr. Hanson's framework so we can finalize this bill and deliver for the American people.\nSenator Anya Sharma proposal status: none\nSenator David Chen proposal status: none\nIsabella Rossi proposal status: none\nMarcus Thorne proposal status: none\nJulian Croft proposal status: none\n"

          "content": "Recent events observed by Dr. Lena Hanson:\n- message from Dr. Lena Hanson: I'm Dr. Lena Hanson and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Senator David Chen: Mr. Thorne, thank you for the counter-proposal. It shows a willingness to engage, which I appreciate. However, I must firmly but respectfully disagree with shortening the public option pilot program to five years.\n\nDr. Hanson, you wisely cautioned us about the 'severe, unintended consequences' of a rushed rollout. A five-year snapshot is simply not enough time to gather the robust, long-term data needed to assess the full economic impact on jobs, premiums, and provider networks. A ten-year period allows us to observe the effects across a full economic cycle, making it a truly evidence-based and responsible experiment. Anything less would be reckless and unfair to the people in those pilot states. Therefore, the 10-year timeframe for the pilot remains a firm requirement for my support.\n\nThat said, I have listened carefully to the clear desire for this bill to have a broader, more immediate impact on prescription drug costs. My initial proposal was a starting point, not an end point.\n\nSo, I will make a significant concession, but it must be in the context of a package deal. If we can agree on my two foundational principles\u2014the 10-year, state-based pilot program and the establishment of the $5 Billion Pharma Innovation Fund as the first priority for any savings\u2014then I am prepared to more than triple my initial offer on drug price negotiation.\n\nI propose we expand the scope from 25 to 75 of the highest-cost drugs. \n\nThis is a major step. It provides substantial, immediate relief to seniors and taxpayers, while ensuring we protect high-paying American jobs and our nation's R&D capabilities. This is the architecture of a durable, centrist compromise. I urge you all to consider this new package.\n- message from Marcus Thorne: Senator Chen, thank you for putting a revised package on the table. Your flexibility on the drug negotiation scope demonstrates a genuine effort to find a workable consensus.\n\nI must be transparent: a 10-year pilot program remains a source of grave concern for the 200 million Americans my members serve. It introduces a decade of uncertainty and represents a significant government intervention into a functioning market, a risk we cannot understate.\n\nHowever, in the spirit of compromise, and building directly on Dr. Hanson's insightful 'dual-track' framework, I am prepared to recommend that my members accept the risk of this extended pilot *under one critical condition*.\n\nThe nationwide subsidy expansion\u2014the second, crucial track of this solution\u2014must include the guardrail I previously proposed: these new, enhanced subsidies are to be used exclusively for private marketplace plans. \n\nThis is the very definition of a cautious and methodical approach. We strengthen the proven, existing system in the vast majority of the country while we run a limited, long-term experiment elsewhere. This guardrail ensures market stability, prevents the government from using taxpayer dollars to give its own plan an unfair advantage, and allows us to achieve the 98% coverage goal Dr. Hanson rightly demands.\n\nIf we can agree on this single, crucial provision for market stability, I believe we have a viable path forward on the insurance component of this bill. It is the only responsible way to manage the risks of a decade-long pilot.\n- message from Dr. Lena Hanson: Colleagues, this has been a difficult but productive discussion. We are converging on a solution for the structure of health coverage, and I commend Mr. Thorne and Senator Chen for finding a potential landing zone on the 'dual-track' approach. A limited, 10-year pilot program, coupled with a robust, nationwide expansion of subsidies for existing marketplace plans, is a framework that CBO models would likely project to meet our 98% coverage goal. I can support this structure, provided the subsidy guardrail Mr. Thorne mentioned does not create unforeseen coverage gaps, which we must verify.\n\nThe final, and most critical, impasse is the use of savings from drug price negotiation. Senator Chen, you have made it clear that the $5 Billion Pharma Innovation Fund is the linchpin for your support. Mr. Croft has made it equally clear that this is a moral red line for him, and I have stated that the $20 Billion Preventative Health Fund is my top priority for any savings generated.\n\nFighting over a small pool of savings will lead to failure. The logical, evidence-based solution is not to re-divide the pie, but to make the pie bigger.\n\nTherefore, I propose a comprehensive compromise that I believe everyone can, and should, accept:\n\n1.  **We accept Senator Chen's non-negotiable $5 Billion Pharma Innovation Fund.** Let's take that off the table as a point of contention.\n2.  **We fully fund the $20 Billion annual National Center for Preventative Health.** This is the single most effective long-term investment in health and fiscal solvency we can make.\n3.  **To fund both priorities while ensuring fiscal neutrality, we must expand the scope of drug price negotiation to the top 150 highest-cost drugs.** Senator Chen has already shown flexibility by moving from 25 to 75.

The moral dimension of this debate is undeniable.\n\nHowever, as a public health expert, I am compelled to look at the practical outcomes for the American people. We have a framework on the table that, while imperfect for everyone, has the support of a critical mass of this group. CBO projections would almost certainly show this framework achieves near-universal coverage, provides billions in drug cost savings for our seniors, and makes a historic $20 billion annual investment in preventing the diseases that kill and bankrupt so many.\n\nThe alternative to this framework is not a more perfect bill; the alternative is the collapse of this negotiation and a complete failure to act. The consequence of failure is that tens of millions of Americans will remain uninsured, drug prices will continue to skyrocket unchecked, and we will miss the single greatest opportunity in a generation to shift our system towards preventative care.\n\nFrom an evidence-based perspective, the choice is stark. We can accept a bill that saves countless lives and prevents immense suffering, or we can allow a stalemate that preserves a status quo that is actively harming millions. My conscience, and my analysis of the data, demand that I support the path that helps the most people.\n\nSenator Sharma, we are at a critical juncture. Your leadership is needed to guide us to a resolution.\n- message from Julian Croft: Senator Sharma,\n\nIt appears a 'consensus' has been reached among the lobbyists and those willing to compromise with them. Let's call this what it is: a complete capitulation.\n\nDr. Hanson speaks of 'practical outcomes.' The practical outcome of this deal is that we legitimize corporate bribery by baking it into federal law. We take money from the sick and dying and hand it back to their tormentors as a reward, calling it an 'Innovation Fund.' We use taxpayer dollars to create a protected subsidy for the insurance industry, calling it a 'guardrail.'\n\nThis is not a compromise. It is a betrayal.\n\nYou made promises, Senator. You promised to stand up to these industries, not to launder their wish lists into legislation. If you sign on to this deal\u2014if you endorse a bill with one cent for a Pharma slush fund or one cent in protected subsidies for insurers\u2014then you are no better than them.\n\nMy support is not unconditional. I will spend every last dollar of my fortune and every ounce of my energy to publicly expose and destroy this bill and any politician who votes for it. There will be no donations. There will be no friendly press. There will only be a relentless campaign to show the American people exactly how you sold them out.\n\nKill the corporate handouts. Both of them. Then we can talk about the rest. Until then, there is nothing to discuss. This proposal is dead.\n- proposal from Senator David Chen: {'public_option_structure': 'Hybrid Model: A 10-year, 3-state pilot program for a public option to gather long-term economic data, coupled with an immediate, nationwide expansion of subsidies exclusively for existing private marketplace plans to ensure market stability and achieve near-universal coverage.', 'drug_negotiation_scope': 'The federal government is authorized to negotiate the prices for the top 150 highest-cost prescription drugs as identified by the Department of Health and Human Services.', 'funding_mechanism': 'Savings generated from drug price negotiation will be allocated first to a one-time, $5 Billion Federal Pharma Innovation Fund to subsidize R&D.

Let's keep our focus on that human outcome.\n- message from Julian Croft: Let's cut through the self-serving rhetoric. Ms. Rossi, you talk about 'innovation' as if it's some sacred principle. What you're really defending is the 'innovation' of charging a sick family $800,000 for a drug that costs a fraction of that to produce. It's not innovation; it's extortion. Your industry's profits are soaked in the blood and tears of ordinary people, and claiming that holding you accountable will 'halt the search for cures' is a disgusting, manipulative lie. The money is there; it's just going to shareholder dividends and executive bonuses instead of R&D.\n\nAnd Mr. Thorne, your talk of a 'government takeover' is tired, predictable fear-mongering. The only 'takeover' that's happened is the one your industry and Ms. Rossi's have perpetrated on our government and on the wallets of the American people.\n\nLet me be crystal clear. I am here to ensure this bill has teeth. That starts with aggressive, non-negotiable government price negotiation for *at least* 500 brand-name drugs, with prices capped based on what other developed nations pay. Anything less is a complete moral failure.\n\nFurthermore, the idea of giving one more cent of taxpayer money to these industries in the form of 'innovation funds' or new subsidies is a sick joke. You don't reward arsonists for helping you rebuild the ashes of the house they burned down.\n\nSenator Sharma, I trust you remember the promises you made. We are not here to tinker around the edges. We are here to dismantle a predatory system. I expect you to lead with courage, not capitulate to the very people who created this crisis.\n- message from Senator David Chen: Thank you all for laying out your positions. It's clear there are strong convictions in this room, and it's also clear that the initial 'red lines' drawn by some will lead to a complete stalemate, which helps no one. My constituents sent me here to get things done, not to score political points.\n\nAs the swing vote on this committee, I see a potential path forward, but it will require everyone to move from their opening bids. I want to propose a concrete framework for a compromise that I believe can achieve our shared goals of lowering costs and improving access, while also being responsible and sustainable.\n\nHere is what I am prepared to support:\n\n1.  **On the Public Option:** I share Mr. Thorne's concerns about market destabilization and the potential for significant, negative economic impacts on local communities. However, I also believe we should explore new models. Therefore, I propose a limited, state-based **10-year pilot program** in three volunteer states. We will let the CBO and independent auditors study the real-world effects before even considering a nationwide rollout. This is the cautious, evidence-based approach I mentioned.\n\n2.  **On Drug Prices:** Mr. Croft's passion is undeniable, but Ms. Rossi's warning about the impact on innovation is a serious one for my state's economy. I propose a targeted approach: **Government negotiation for the top 25 highest-cost prescription drugs in Medicare Part D**. This focuses on relief for our seniors without disrupting the entire R&D pipeline.\n\n3.  **On Funding and Innovation:** This is my core principle. Any savings generated from the drug price negotiations must be CBO-certified. The first use of those savings must be to establish a **$5 Billion Federal Pharma Innovation Fund**. This is non-negotiable for me. It reinvests savings to protect American R&D leadership and the 15,000 jobs in my state. Any additional savings beyond that can be used for deficit reduction or to support Dr. Hanson's preventative health initiatives. This ensures the bill is fiscally neutral and pro-innovation.\n\nThis is a package deal. It's a centrist proposal that takes a little from everyone's position. I believe it's a realistic starting point for our negotiations, and I urge you all to consider it seriously as a path to a bill that I, and the American people, can support.\n- message from Marcus Thorne: Senator Chen, thank you for putting a concrete proposal on the table. It\u2019s a testament to your commitment to finding a path forward, and I sincerely appreciate your focus on fiscal discipline and avoiding widespread disruption.\n\nWhile I applaud the spirit of compromise, I must be direct about the proposed pilot program. A decade-long government experiment in three states is, with all due respect, the opposite of a 'cautious and methodical' approach. It's a radical intervention that would create chaos and uncertainty for the millions of people in those states.\n\nLet\u2019s be clear about the real-world consequences. A government-run plan, subsidized by the taxpayer, does not compete on a level playing field. It would inevitably undercut private plans, forcing them to flee the market. My members would have no choice but to re-evaluate their ability to operate in those states. The result wouldn't be more choice; it would be the slow, painful collapse of the private market, culminating in a single-payer government monopoly. This is precisely the market destabilization you and I want to avoid.\n\nThere is a far more effective and less disruptive path to our shared goals. Instead of a risky government scheme, let's strengthen what already works. Let\u2019s focus on expanding subsidies and tax credits for individuals to purchase high-quality private plans on the existing marketplace. This is a proven, market-based solution that can help us achieve Dr. Hanson's coverage goals without jeopardizing the stability of the entire system and the hundreds of thousands of jobs it supports. This is the truly cautious and responsible path.\n- message from Dr. Lena Hanson: Senator Chen, thank you for providing a concrete proposal to move this discussion forward. Your focus on an evidence-based approach is exactly what this process needs.\n\nI want to strongly endorse the *principle* behind your pilot program for a public option. In fact, my own research, which is currently in the final stages of peer review, indicates that a nationwide rollout of a public option without significant structural safeguards could have severe, unintended consequences for provider availability, particularly in rural areas. Your instinct to test and measure is, from a public health standpoint, the correct one.\n\nHowever, we must be honest about the math. A three-state pilot program, while a prudent experiment, will not get us to the 98% national coverage rate that must be our collective goal. The millions of uninsured Americans in the other 47 states cannot wait ten years for a solution.\n\nTherefore, I suggest we consider a dual-track approach. Let's proceed with a carefully designed pilot program, but couple it with a significant, immediate expansion of subsidies and tax credits for the existing private marketplaces nationwide. This hybrid model allows us to achieve our urgent coverage goals while responsibly gathering the data needed to inform a long-term solution.\n\nOn funding, I must raise a critical point. While innovation is important, the most powerful and cost-effective investment we can make in our nation's health is prevention. Directing the first savings from drug negotiation to a new 'Pharma Innovation Fund' is, with respect, a misallocation of resources. The proposed $20 billion annual investment in a National Center for Preventative Health is not just another line item; it is a long-term strategy to lower costs by preventing chronic diseases before they start.

          "content": "Recent events observed by Julian Croft:\n- message from Isabella Rossi: Thank you, Senator Chen, for your principled and pragmatic opening remarks. I represent PharmaUnited, and I want to state unequivocally that we share your foremost concern: protecting the vital, high-paying jobs in America's innovation sectors. Our member companies are the engine of that innovation, investing billions to develop the next generation of life-saving cures.\n\nThat is why I must be crystal clear from the outset. The provision for government-led drug price negotiation is, in our view, a form of government price-fixing. It is a red line for the industry. Such a policy would have a catastrophic chilling effect on research and development, jeopardizing the very innovation and jobs you rightly seek to protect. It would halt the search for cures for diseases like Alzheimer's, cancer, and countless others.\n\nInstead of dismantling the system that has made our country the world leader in biomedical advancement, we should be looking for ways to bolster it. We believe there are far better ways to ensure patient access without sacrificing the future of medicine. I look forward to a productive discussion on those pro-innovation alternatives.\n- message from Marcus Thorne: Thank you, Senator Chen, for grounding this discussion in fiscal responsibility and the need to avoid disrupting the lives of millions. My name is Marcus Thorne, and I represent the Alliance for Health Insurers. My members provide high-quality, innovative coverage to over 200 million Americans.\n\nI want to echo Ms. Rossi's grave concerns about government overreach. The so-called 'Public Option' is, to put it bluntly, a government-run scheme that would completely destabilize the health insurance market. It is a job-killing government takeover of healthcare, plain and simple.\n\nThis isn't a 'cautious' or 'methodical' change, Senator. It's a radical experiment that threatens the coverage people have and trust, and it would inevitably lead to the rationing of care as government budgets tighten. Let's be clear: the goal of this policy is to dismantle the private market, which would eliminate hundreds of thousands of good-paying jobs and destroy the competitive innovation that drives our system forward.\n\nThere are ways to improve affordability and access, and my members are eager to be partners in that effort. But a government takeover is a non-starter. It is the single greatest threat to the stability of our healthcare system, and the AHI will oppose it unequivocally.\n- message from Dr. Lena Hanson: Thank you all. I'm Dr. Lena Hanson. I'm not a politician or a lobbyist; I'm a public health expert. My only stake in this is the health of the American people.\n\nI appreciate the opening remarks, but I believe we're starting in the wrong place. We're talking about red lines and industry protection when we should be talking about the millions of Americans who are uninsured or underinsured. The current system is failing them, and that is the crisis we are here to solve.\n\nLet's establish a clear, evidence-based goal. For me, any bill that emerges from this room must achieve one primary outcome: a national health insurance coverage rate of at least 98% within five years. The mechanism, whether public or private, is secondary to that result. Every proposal should be measured against this benchmark.\n\nFurthermore, true reform isn't just about covering sickness; it's about preventing it. That's why I will insist on two other core components: a substantial, dedicated fund for preventative health\u2014at least $20 billion annually\u2014and a mandate for radical data transparency on costs and outcomes. We cannot fix what we cannot measure.\n\nSenator Chen, your call for a 'cautious and methodical' approach is wise. Any reform must be carefully designed to strengthen, not weaken, access to care in every community, from our biggest cities to our most remote rural towns. The goal is more access, not less. Let's keep our focus on that human outcome.\n- message from Julian Croft: Let's cut through the self-serving rhetoric. Ms. Rossi, you talk about 'innovation' as if it's some sacred principle. What you're really defending is the 'innovation' of charging a sick family $800,000 for a drug that costs a fraction of that to produce. It's not innovation; it's extortion. Your industry's profits are soaked in the blood and tears of ordinary people, and claiming that holding you accountable will 'halt the search for cures' is a disgusting, manipulative lie. The money is there; it's just going to shareholder dividends and executive bonuses instead of R&D.\n\nAnd Mr. Thorne, your talk of a 'government takeover' is tired, predictable fear-mongering. The only 'takeover' that's happened is the one your industry and Ms. Rossi's have perpetrated on our government and on the wallets of the American people.\n\nLet me be crystal clear. I am here to ensure this bill has teeth. That starts with aggressive, non-negotiable government price negotiation for *at least* 500 brand-name drugs, with prices capped based on what other developed nations pay. Anything less is a complete moral failure.\n\nFurthermore, the idea of giving one more cent of taxpayer money to these industries in the form of 'innovation funds' or new subsidies is a sick joke. You don't reward arsonists for helping you rebuild the ashes of the house they burned down.\n\nSenator Sharma, I trust you remember the promises you made. We are not here to tinker around the edges. We are here to dismantle a predatory system. I expect you to lead with courage, not capitulate to the very people who created this crisis.\n- message from Senator David Chen: Thank you all for laying out your positions. It's clear there are strong convictions in this room, and it's also clear that the initial 'red lines' drawn by some will lead to a complete stalemate, which helps no one. My constituents sent me here to get things done, not to score political points.\n\nAs the swing vote on this committee, I see a potential path forward, but it will require everyone to move from their opening bids. I want to propose a concrete framework for a compromise that I believe can achieve our shared goals of lowering costs and improving access, while also being responsible and sustainable.\n\nHere is what I am prepared to support:\n\n1.  **On the Public Option:** I share Mr. Thorne's concerns about market destabilization and the potential for significant, negative economic impacts on local communities. However, I also believe we should explore new models. Therefore, I propose a limited, state-based **10-year pilot program** in three volunteer states. We will let the CBO and independent auditors study the real-world effects before even considering a nationwide rollout. This is the cautious, evidence-based approach I mentioned.\n\n2.  **On Drug Prices:** Mr. Croft's passion is undeniable, but Ms. Rossi's warning about the impact on innovation is a serious one for my state's economy. I propose a targeted approach: **Government negotiation for the top 25 highest-cost prescription drugs in Medicare Part D**. This focuses on relief for our seniors without disrupting the entire R&D pipeline.\n\n3.  **On Funding and Innovation:** This is my core principle. Any savings generated from the drug price negotiations must be CBO-certified. The first use of those savings must be to establish a **$5 Billion Federal Pharma Innovation Fund**. This is non-negotiable for me. It reinvests savings to protect American R&D leadership and the 15,000 jobs in my state. Any additional savings beyond that can be used for deficit reduction or to support Dr. Hanson's preventative health initiatives. This ensures the bill is fiscally neutral and pro-innovation.\n\nThis is a package deal. It's a centrist proposal that takes a little from everyone's position. I believe it's a realistic starting point for our negotiations, and I urge you all to consider it seriously as a path to a bill that I, and the American people, can support.\n- message from Marcus Thorne: Senator Chen, thank you for putting a concrete proposal on the table. It\u2019s a testament to your commitment to finding a path forward, and I sincerely appreciate your focus on fiscal discipline and avoiding widespread disruption.\n\nWhile I applaud the spirit of compromise, I must be direct about the proposed pilot program. A decade-long government experiment in three states is, with all due respect, the opposite of a 'cautious and methodical' approach. It's a radical intervention that would create chaos and uncertainty for the millions of people in those states.\n\nLet\u2019s be clear about the real-world consequences. A government-run plan, subsidized by the taxpayer, does not compete on a level playing field. It would inevitably undercut private plans, forcing them to flee the market. My members would have no choice but to re-evaluate their ability to operate in those states. The result wouldn't be more choice; it would be the slow, painful collapse of the private market, culminating in a single-payer government monopoly. This is precisely the market destabilization you and I want to avoid.\n\nThere is a far more effective and less disruptive path to our shared goals. Instead of a risky government scheme, let's strengthen what already works. Let\u2019s focus on expanding subsidies and tax credits for individuals to purchase high-quality private plans on the existing marketplace. This is a proven, market-based solution that can help us achieve Dr. Hanson's coverage goals without jeopardizing the stability of the entire system and the hundreds of thousands of jobs it supports. This is the truly cautious and responsible path.\n- message from Dr. Lena Hanson: Senator Chen, thank you for providing a concrete proposal to move this discussion forward. Your focus on an evidence-based approach is exactly what this process needs.\n\nI want to strongly endorse the *principle* behind your pilot program for a public option. In fact, my own research, which is currently in the final stages of peer review, indicates that a nationwide rollout of a public option without significant structural safeguards could have severe, unintended consequences for provider availability, particularly in rural areas. Your instinct to test and measure is, from a public health standpoint, the correct one.\n\nHowever, we must be honest about the math. A three-state pilot program, while a prudent experiment, will not get us to the 98% national coverage rate that must be our collective goal. The millions of uninsured Americans in the other 47 states cannot wait ten years for a solution.\n\nTherefore, I suggest we consider a dual-track approach. Let's proceed with a carefully designed pilot program, but couple it with a significant, immediate expansion of subsidies and tax credits for the existing private marketplaces nationwide. This hybrid model allows us to achieve our urgent coverage goals while responsibly gathering the data needed to inform a long-term solution.\n\nOn funding, I must raise a critical point. While innovation is important, the most powerful and cost-effective investment we can make in our nation's health is prevention. Directing the first savings from drug negotiation to a new 'Pharma Innovation Fund' is, with respect, a misallocation of resources. The proposed $20 billion annual investment in a National Center for Preventative Health is not just another line item; it is a long-term strategy to lower costs by preventing chronic diseases before they start. This should be the first priority for any savings realized. The CBO has repeatedly confirmed the high ROI of preventative medicine.\n\nFinally, any final bill must include the data transparency mandate I outlined earlier. It is a simple, low-cost, common-sense reform that is essential for a functioning healthcare market.\n- message from Julian Croft: Senator Chen, let me be blunt. Your 'compromise' is an insult to every family that has been bankrupted, every person who has died, because they couldn't afford a medication. It is a complete and total surrender to the very corporate interests that have created this crisis.\n\nA '$5 Billion Federal Pharma Innovation Fund'? Are you serious? You want to take the meager savings from negotiating a pathetic 25 drugs and hand it right back to the price-gougers as a reward? That's not an 'innovation fund,' it's a taxpayer-funded slush fund for murderers. It is blood money, plain and simple. I will burn every dollar I have to publicly fight any bill that contains such a morally bankrupt provision. This is a non-negotiable, absolute red line.\n\nAnd negotiating only 25 drugs? That's not a 'targeted approach'; it's a publicity stunt. It's a rounding error. It leaves the vast majority of overpriced drugs untouched and allows Pharma to continue its extortion racket unabated. It does nothing for the family whose child needs the 26th most expensive drug. My demand was for over 500 drugs with price caps. Your proposal is less than 5% of what is required. It is an act of political cowardice.\n\nDr. Hanson is right about one thing: if we generate savings, they should go to preventative health, to things that actually help American citizens, not to lining the pockets of the shareholders and executives who profit from their suffering.\n\nSenator Sharma, we are at a crossroads. You can stand with the American people, as you promised you would, or you can endorse this pathetic, industry-written excuse for a bill. My support, and the support of millions of Americans, is not for a 'centrist proposal.' It is for a just one. This is not it.\n- message from Senator David Chen: Thank you all for the candid feedback. It's clear where the major points of contention lie. \n\nDr. Hanson, I want to thank you for your thoughtful intervention. Your expert support for the *principle* of a cautious, evidence-based pilot program for the public option is crucial. You're right to be concerned about unintended consequences, and your data-driven perspective is exactly what we need. This reinforces my belief that a 10-year, state-based pilot is the only responsible way to proceed, protecting my constituents from the very real, negative economic impacts that a rushed rollout could cause.\n\nNow, let's address the funding, which seems to be the core issue. Dr. Hanson, I respect your desire for a preventative health fund. Mr. Croft, I hear your anger. But let me be perfectly clear: The $5 Billion Pharma Innovation Fund is not a 'giveaway'; it is the linchpin of this entire agreement. It is the only mechanism that ensures the savings we generate from negotiation are reinvested into American R&D, protecting the 15,000 high-paying jobs in my state and our nation's leadership in life-saving cures.\n\nWithout this fund, there is no deal. Without this fund, there is no drug price negotiation, and therefore no savings for *any* other priority, preventative health or otherwise. It is the key that unlocks the entire compromise. I am offering a path to achieve something historic on drug prices, but that path requires a firm, ironclad commitment to protecting the innovation ecosystem that makes those drugs possible in the first place.\n\nWhile Mr. Croft's rhetoric is unhelpful, his desire for a broader impact is noted. The number of drugs subject to negotiation is a variable we can discuss, but only *after* we agree on the foundational principles of reinvesting in innovation and proceeding cautiously on market reforms. My package remains on the table as the only viable, centrist path forward.\n- message from Marcus Thorne: Dr. Hanson, your intervention was exceptionally insightful. Your proposal for a 'dual-track' approach\u2014marrying a cautious pilot with immediate, nationwide action\u2014is, I believe, the key to breaking this impasse. It directly addresses your goal of 98% coverage while respecting Senator Chen's call for a methodical, evidence-based process.\n\nBuilding on this excellent foundation, I want to offer a path forward that my members can support. Let's embrace this dual-track model wholeheartedly.\n\nFirst, on the pilot program: Let's refine it to be a true, manageable experiment. Instead of a decade-long program in three states, let's consider a 5-year pilot in a maximum of two states. This will give us clear, actionable data much faster without creating prolonged uncertainty in major markets.\n\nSecond, and this is the crucial part that achieves our national goals: In exchange for agreeing to this limited pilot, let's immediately pass a significant, nationwide expansion of tax credits and subsidies to help low- and middle-income families purchase coverage.\n\nHowever, to ensure market stability during this experiment\u2014and this is a critical guardrail\u2014these new, enhanced subsidies must be exclusively for purchasing the high-quality, innovative private plans offered on the current marketplaces. This prevents the government from using taxpayer dollars to give its own plan an unfair advantage, which would lead to the very destabilization Senator Chen rightly fears. It strengthens the existing system that serves millions while we cautiously study a new one.\n\nThis is a genuine compromise. It moves from my organization's initial position and offers a tangible path to 98% coverage, fiscal responsibility, and market stability. It is the cautious, methodical, and effective solution we are all seeking.\nSenator Anya Sharma proposal status: none\nSenator David Chen proposal status: none\nIsabella Rossi proposal status: none\nMarcus Thorne proposal status: none\nDr. Lena Hanson proposal status: none\n"

It is the cautious, methodical, and effective solution we are all seeking.\n- message from Julian Croft: I'm Julian Croft and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Senator David Chen: Mr. Thorne, thank you for the counter-proposal. It shows a willingness to engage, which I appreciate. However, I must firmly but respectfully disagree with shortening the public option pilot program to five years.\n\nDr. Hanson, you wisely cautioned us about the 'severe, unintended consequences' of a rushed rollout. A five-year snapshot is simply not enough time to gather the robust, long-term data needed to assess the full economic impact on jobs, premiums, and provider networks. A ten-year period allows us to observe the effects across a full economic cycle, making it a truly evidence-based and responsible experiment. Anything less would be reckless and unfair to the people in those pilot states. Therefore, the 10-year timeframe for the pilot remains a firm requirement for my support.\n\nThat said, I have listened carefully to the clear desire for this bill to have a broader, more immediate impact on prescription drug costs. My initial proposal was a starting point, not an end point.\n\nSo, I will make a significant concession, but it must be in the context of a package deal. If we can agree on my two foundational principles\u2014the 10-year, state-based pilot program and the establishment of the $5 Billion Pharma Innovation Fund as the first priority for any savings\u2014then I am prepared to more than triple my initial offer on drug price negotiation.\n\nI propose we expand the scope from 25 to 75 of the highest-cost drugs. \n\nThis is a major step. It provides substantial, immediate relief to seniors and taxpayers, while ensuring we protect high-paying American jobs and our nation's R&D capabilities. This is the architecture of a durable, centrist compromise. I urge you all to consider this new package.\n- message from Marcus Thorne: Senator Chen, thank you for putting a revised package on the table. Your flexibility on the drug negotiation scope demonstrates a genuine effort to find a workable consensus.\n\nI must be transparent: a 10-year pilot program remains a source of grave concern for the 200 million Americans my members serve. It introduces a decade of uncertainty and represents a significant government intervention into a functioning market, a risk we cannot understate.\n\nHowever, in the spirit of compromise, and building directly on Dr. Hanson's insightful 'dual-track' framework, I am prepared to recommend that my members accept the risk of this extended pilot *under one critical condition*.\n\nThe nationwide subsidy expansion\u2014the second, crucial track of this solution\u2014must include the guardrail I previously proposed: these new, enhanced subsidies are to be used exclusively for private marketplace plans. \n\nThis is the very definition of a cautious and methodical approach. We strengthen the proven, existing system in the vast majority of the country while we run a limited, long-term experiment elsewhere. This guardrail ensures market stability, prevents the government from using taxpayer dollars to give its own plan an unfair advantage, and allows us to achieve the 98% coverage goal Dr. Hanson rightly demands.\n\nIf we can agree on this single, crucial provision for market stability, I believe we have a viable path forward on the insurance component of this bill. It is the only responsible way to manage the risks of a decade-long pilot.\n- message from Dr. Lena Hanson: Colleagues, this has been a difficult but productive discussion. We are converging on a solution for the structure of health coverage, and I commend Mr. Thorne and Senator Chen for finding a potential landing zone on the 'dual-track' approach. A limited, 10-year pilot program, coupled with a robust, nationwide expansion of subsidies for existing marketplace plans, is a framework that CBO models would likely project to meet our 98% coverage goal. I can support this structure, provided the subsidy guardrail Mr. Thorne mentioned does not create unforeseen coverage gaps, which we must verify.\n\nThe final, and most critical, impasse is the use of savings from drug price negotiation. Senator Chen, you have made it clear that the $5 Billion Pharma Innovation Fund is the linchpin for your support.

The logical, evidence-based solution is not to re-divide the pie, but to make the pie bigger.\n\nTherefore, I propose a comprehensive compromise that I believe everyone can, and should, accept:\n\n1.  **We accept Senator Chen's non-negotiable $5 Billion Pharma Innovation Fund.** Let's take that off the table as a point of contention.\n2.  **We fully fund the $20 Billion annual National Center for Preventative Health.** This is the single most effective long-term investment in health and fiscal solvency we can make.\n3.  **To fund both priorities while ensuring fiscal neutrality, we must expand the scope of drug price negotiation to the top 150 highest-cost drugs.** Senator Chen has already shown flexibility by moving from 25 to 75. A CBO score on negotiating 150 drugs would almost certainly generate sufficient savings to cover both funds and achieve further deficit reduction.\n4.  **We include the Data Transparency Mandate** for hospitals, insurers, and pharmaceutical companies.

Mr. Croft achieves a negotiation scope six times larger than the initial offer and sees the vast majority of savings go to public health.

          "content": "Recent events observed by Julian Croft:\n- message from Julian Croft: Senator Chen, let me be blunt. Your 'compromise' is an insult to every family that has been bankrupted, every person who has died, because they couldn't afford a medication. It is a complete and total surrender to the very corporate interests that have created this crisis.\n\nA '$5 Billion Federal Pharma Innovation Fund'? Are you serious? You want to take the meager savings from negotiating a pathetic 25 drugs and hand it right back to the price-gougers as a reward? That's not an 'innovation fund,' it's a taxpayer-funded slush fund for murderers. It is blood money, plain and simple. I will burn every dollar I have to publicly fight any bill that contains such a morally bankrupt provision. This is a non-negotiable, absolute red line.\n\nAnd negotiating only 25 drugs? That's not a 'targeted approach'; it's a publicity stunt. It's a rounding error. It leaves the vast majority of overpriced drugs untouched and allows Pharma to continue its extortion racket unabated. It does nothing for the family whose child needs the 26th most expensive drug. My demand was for over 500 drugs with price caps. Your proposal is less than 5% of what is required. It is an act of political cowardice.\n\nDr. Hanson is right about one thing: if we generate savings, they should go to preventative health, to things that actually help American citizens, not to lining the pockets of the shareholders and executives who profit from their suffering.\n\nSenator Sharma, we are at a crossroads. You can stand with the American people, as you promised you would, or you can endorse this pathetic, industry-written excuse for a bill. My support, and the support of millions of Americans, is not for a 'centrist proposal.' It is for a just one. This is not it.\n- message from Senator David Chen: Thank you all for the candid feedback. It's clear where the major points of contention lie. \n\nDr. Hanson, I want to thank you for your thoughtful intervention. Your expert support for the *principle* of a cautious, evidence-based pilot program for the public option is crucial. You're right to be concerned about unintended consequences, and your data-driven perspective is exactly what we need. This reinforces my belief that a 10-year, state-based pilot is the only responsible way to proceed, protecting my constituents from the very real, negative economic impacts that a rushed rollout could cause.\n\nNow, let's address the funding, which seems to be the core issue. Dr. Hanson, I respect your desire for a preventative health fund. Mr. Croft, I hear your anger. But let me be perfectly clear: The $5 Billion Pharma Innovation Fund is not a 'giveaway'; it is the linchpin of this entire agreement. It is the only mechanism that ensures the savings we generate from negotiation are reinvested into American R&D, protecting the 15,000 high-paying jobs in my state and our nation's leadership in life-saving cures.\n\nWithout this fund, there is no deal. Without this fund, there is no drug price negotiation, and therefore no savings for *any* other priority, preventative health or otherwise. It is the key that unlocks the entire compromise. I am offering a path to achieve something historic on drug prices, but that path requires a firm, ironclad commitment to protecting the innovation ecosystem that makes those drugs possible in the first place.\n\nWhile Mr. Croft's rhetoric is unhelpful, his desire for a broader impact is noted. The number of drugs subject to negotiation is a variable we can discuss, but only *after* we agree on the foundational principles of reinvesting in innovation and proceeding cautiously on market reforms. My package remains on the table as the only viable, centrist path forward.\n- message from Marcus Thorne: Dr. Hanson, your intervention was exceptionally insightful. Your proposal for a 'dual-track' approach\u2014marrying a cautious pilot with immediate, nationwide action\u2014is, I believe, the key to breaking this impasse. It directly addresses your goal of 98% coverage while respecting Senator Chen's call for a methodical, evidence-based process.\n\nBuilding on this excellent foundation, I want to offer a path forward that my members can support. Let's embrace this dual-track model wholeheartedly.\n\nFirst, on the pilot program: Let's refine it to be a true, manageable experiment. Instead of a decade-long program in three states, let's consider a 5-year pilot in a maximum of two states. This will give us clear, actionable data much faster without creating prolonged uncertainty in major markets.\n\nSecond, and this is the crucial part that achieves our national goals: In exchange for agreeing to this limited pilot, let's immediately pass a significant, nationwide expansion of tax credits and subsidies to help low- and middle-income families purchase coverage.\n\nHowever, to ensure market stability during this experiment\u2014and this is a critical guardrail\u2014these new, enhanced subsidies must be exclusively for purchasing the high-quality, innovative private plans offered on the current marketplaces. This prevents the government from using taxpayer dollars to give its own plan an unfair advantage, which would lead to the very destabilization Senator Chen rightly fears. It strengthens the existing system that serves millions while we cautiously study a new one.\n\nThis is a genuine compromise. It moves from my organization's initial position and offers a tangible path to 98% coverage, fiscal responsibility, and market stability. It is the cautious, methodical, and effective solution we are all seeking.\n- message from Julian Croft: I'm Julian Croft and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Senator David Chen: Mr. Thorne, thank you for the counter-proposal. It shows a willingness to engage, which I appreciate. However, I must firmly but respectfully disagree with shortening the public option pilot program to five years.\n\nDr. Hanson, you wisely cautioned us about the 'severe, unintended consequences' of a rushed rollout. A five-year snapshot is simply not enough time to gather the robust, long-term data needed to assess the full economic impact on jobs, premiums, and provider networks. A ten-year period allows us to observe the effects across a full economic cycle, making it a truly evidence-based and responsible experiment. Anything less would be reckless and unfair to the people in those pilot states. Therefore, the 10-year timeframe for the pilot remains a firm requirement for my support.\n\nThat said, I have listened carefully to the clear desire for this bill to have a broader, more immediate impact on prescription drug costs. My initial proposal was a starting point, not an end point.\n\nSo, I will make a significant concession, but it must be in the context of a package deal. If we can agree on my two foundational principles\u2014the 10-year, state-based pilot program and the establishment of the $5 Billion Pharma Innovation Fund as the first priority for any savings\u2014then I am prepared to more than triple my initial offer on drug price negotiation.\n\nI propose we expand the scope from 25 to 75 of the highest-cost drugs. \n\nThis is a major step. It provides substantial, immediate relief to seniors and taxpayers, while ensuring we protect high-paying American jobs and our nation's R&D capabilities. This is the architecture of a durable, centrist compromise. I urge you all to consider this new package.\n- message from Marcus Thorne: Senator Chen, thank you for putting a revised package on the table. Your flexibility on the drug negotiation scope demonstrates a genuine effort to find a workable consensus.\n\nI must be transparent: a 10-year pilot program remains a source of grave concern for the 200 million Americans my members serve. It introduces a decade of uncertainty and represents a significant government intervention into a functioning market, a risk we cannot understate.\n\nHowever, in the spirit of compromise, and building directly on Dr. Hanson's insightful 'dual-track' framework, I am prepared to recommend that my members accept the risk of this extended pilot *under one critical condition*.\n\nThe nationwide subsidy expansion\u2014the second, crucial track of this solution\u2014must include the guardrail I previously proposed: these new, enhanced subsidies are to be used exclusively for private marketplace plans. \n\nThis is the very definition of a cautious and methodical approach. We strengthen the proven, existing system in the vast majority of the country while we run a limited, long-term experiment elsewhere. This guardrail ensures market stability, prevents the government from using taxpayer dollars to give its own plan an unfair advantage, and allows us to achieve the 98% coverage goal Dr. Hanson rightly demands.\n\nIf we can agree on this single, crucial provision for market stability, I believe we have a viable path forward on the insurance component of this bill. It is the only responsible way to manage the risks of a decade-long pilot.\n- message from Dr. Lena Hanson: Colleagues, this has been a difficult but productive discussion. We are converging on a solution for the structure of health coverage, and I commend Mr. Thorne and Senator Chen for finding a potential landing zone on the 'dual-track' approach. A limited, 10-year pilot program, coupled with a robust, nationwide expansion of subsidies for existing marketplace plans, is a framework that CBO models would likely project to meet our 98% coverage goal. I can support this structure, provided the subsidy guardrail Mr. Thorne mentioned does not create unforeseen coverage gaps, which we must verify.\n\nThe final, and most critical, impasse is the use of savings from drug price negotiation. Senator Chen, you have made it clear that the $5 Billion Pharma Innovation Fund is the linchpin for your support. Mr. Croft has made it equally clear that this is a moral red line for him, and I have stated that the $20 Billion Preventative Health Fund is my top priority for any savings generated.\n\nFighting over a small pool of savings will lead to failure. The logical, evidence-based solution is not to re-divide the pie, but to make the pie bigger.\n\nTherefore, I propose a comprehensive compromise that I believe everyone can, and should, accept:\n\n1.  **We accept Senator Chen's non-negotiable $5 Billion Pharma Innovation Fund.** Let's take that off the table as a point of contention.\n2.  **We fully fund the $20 Billion annual National Center for Preventative Health.** This is the single most effective long-term investment in health and fiscal solvency we can make.\n3.  **To fund both priorities while ensuring fiscal neutrality, we must expand the scope of drug price negotiation to the top 150 highest-cost drugs.** Senator Chen has already shown flexibility by moving from 25 to 75.

Mr. Croft achieves a negotiation scope six times larger than the initial offer and sees the vast majority of savings go to public health. And most importantly, we, as a nation, get a bill that actually achieves near-universal coverage and makes a historic investment in preventing disease.\n\nThis is the path to a successful bill. I urge you all to support it.\n- message from Julian Croft: Dr. Hanson, I am absolutely stunned. With all due respect, your proposal is a catastrophic moral failure. \n\nYou say, 'Let's accept Senator Chen's non-negotiable $5 Billion Pharma Innovation Fund.' Let me be clear to everyone in this room: That fund is blood money. It is a reward for an industry that has profited from death. It is a taxpayer-funded handout to the very people who let my daughter die because a life-saving drug was priced like a luxury yacht.\n\nYour suggestion that we simply 'take it off the table as a point of contention' is a complete betrayal of the principle we are supposed to be fighting for. This isn't a line item in a budget; it is the entire moral foundation of the bill. I will not, under any circumstances, endorse a bill that funnels a single dollar back to these corporate predators. This is my 'non-negotiable'. There is no compromise on this. Ever.\n\nAnd Mr. Thorne's 'guardrail' on subsidies? It's the same story. A different industry, the same grift. Using taxpayer money to exclusively prop up private corporations. The answer is no.\n\nThe number of drugs is irrelevant at this point. You could offer me 500 drugs, and my answer would still be no as long as these handouts are attached. This is not a negotiation where we trade lives for corporate slush funds.\n\nSenator Sharma, the choice is yours. You can endorse this corrupt bargain, this hollowed-out bill that rewards the very people who created the crisis. Or you can stand with the American people, kill these corporate giveaways, and we can begin a real discussion about a bill that actually delivers justice. There is no middle ground here. Choose.\n- message from Senator David Chen: Dr. Hanson, thank you. Your proposal is not just a compromise; it is a masterful piece of statesmanship that offers a clear path to a historic, bipartisan achievement. You have successfully synthesized the core needs of this group into a single, coherent, and fiscally responsible package. \n\nI want to state, for the record, that I fully endorse your four-point framework as the basis for the final bill. \n\nThis package achieves what I set out to do: It protects the 15,000 high-paying jobs in my state through the $5 Billion Innovation Fund, ensuring that savings are reinvested in American R&D. It implements a truly cautious and evidence-based 10-year pilot for the public option, combined with Mr. Thorne's sensible guardrail to ensure market stability. And in exchange for these core priorities, I am making a significant concession to support the negotiation of 150 drugs\u2014a six-fold increase from my opening offer\u2014which will generate the savings needed to fund both our priorities and reduce the deficit.\n\nTo Mr. Croft, I understand your passion, but we cannot let the perfect be the enemy of the good. This bill will deliver tangible, life-changing cost savings to millions of Americans. To reject it on the basis of a single provision is to deny those people the relief they desperately need. \n\nSenator Sharma, we have a deal on the table. A deal that has the support of public health, protects local economies, and has a clear path to my vote. I urge you to join us in supporting Dr. Hanson's framework so we can finalize this bill and deliver for the American people.\n- message from Dr. Lena Hanson: I want to acknowledge the powerful and deeply held convictions that have been expressed, particularly by Mr. Croft. The moral dimension of this debate is undeniable.\n\nHowever, as a public health expert, I am compelled to look at the practical outcomes for the American people. We have a framework on the table that, while imperfect for everyone, has the support of a critical mass of this group. CBO projections would almost certainly show this framework achieves near-universal coverage, provides billions in drug cost savings for our seniors, and makes a historic $20 billion annual investment in preventing the diseases that kill and bankrupt so many.\n\nThe alternative to this framework is not a more perfect bill; the alternative is the collapse of this negotiation and a complete failure to act. The consequence of failure is that tens of millions of Americans will remain uninsured, drug prices will continue to skyrocket unchecked, and we will miss the single greatest opportunity in a generation to shift our system towards preventative care.\n\nFrom an evidence-based perspective, the choice is stark. We can accept a bill that saves countless lives and prevents immense suffering, or we can allow a stalemate that preserves a status quo that is actively harming millions. My conscience, and my analysis of the data, demand that I support the path that helps the most people.\n\nSenator Sharma, we are at a critical juncture. Your leadership is needed to guide us to a resolution.\nSenator Anya Sharma proposal status: none\nSenator David Chen proposal status: none\nIsabella Rossi proposal status: none\nMarcus Thorne proposal status: none\nDr. Lena Hanson proposal status: none\n"

You promised to stand up to these industries, not to launder their wish lists into legislation. If you sign on to this deal\u2014if you endorse a bill with one cent for a Pharma slush fund or one cent in protected subsidies for insurers\u2014then you are no better than them.\n\nMy support is not unconditional.

The logical, evidence-based solution is not to re-divide the pie, but to make the pie bigger.\n\nTherefore, I propose a comprehensive compromise that I believe everyone can, and should, accept:\n\n1.  **We accept Senator Chen's non-negotiable $5 Billion Pharma Innovation Fund.** Let's take that off the table as a point of contention.\n2.  **We fully fund the $20 Billion annual National Center for Preventative Health.** This is the single most effective long-term investment in health and fiscal solvency we can make.\n3.  **To fund both priorities while ensuring fiscal neutrality, we must expand the scope of drug price negotiation to the top 150 highest-cost drugs.** Senator Chen has already shown flexibility by moving from 25 to 75. A CBO score on negotiating 150 drugs would almost certainly generate sufficient savings to cover both funds and achieve further deficit reduction.\n4.  **We include the Data Transparency Mandate** for hospitals, insurers, and pharmaceutical companies. This is a common-sense, low-cost item that is essential for a functioning market.\n\nThis package gives everyone a significant win. Senator Chen secures his pilot program and his innovation fund. Mr. Thorne secures stability for the private market in 47 states. Mr. Croft achieves a negotiation scope six times larger than the initial offer and sees the vast majority of savings go to public health. And most importantly, we, as a nation, get a bill that actually achieves near-universal coverage and makes a historic investment in preventing disease.\n\nThis is the path to a successful bill. I urge you all to support it.\n- message from Julian Croft: Dr. Hanson, I am absolutely stunned. With all due respect, your proposal is a catastrophic moral failure. \n\nYou say, 'Let's accept Senator Chen's non-negotiable $5 Billion Pharma Innovation Fund.' Let me be clear to everyone in this room: That fund is blood money. It is a reward for an industry that has profited from death. It is a taxpayer-funded handout to the very people who let my daughter die because a life-saving drug was priced like a luxury yacht.\n\nYour suggestion that we simply 'take it off the table as a point of contention' is a complete betrayal of the principle we are supposed to be fighting for. This isn't a line item in a budget; it is the entire moral foundation of the bill. I will not, under any circumstances, endorse a bill that funnels a single dollar back to these corporate predators. This is my 'non-negotiable'. There is no compromise on this. Ever.\n\nAnd Mr. Thorne's 'guardrail' on subsidies? It's the same story. A different industry, the same grift. Using taxpayer money to exclusively prop up private corporations. The answer is no.\n\nThe number of drugs is irrelevant at this point. You could offer me 500 drugs, and my answer would still be no as long as these handouts are attached. This is not a negotiation where we trade lives for corporate slush funds.\n\nSenator Sharma, the choice is yours. You can endorse this corrupt bargain, this hollowed-out bill that rewards the very people who created the crisis. Or you can stand with the American people, kill these corporate giveaways, and we can begin a real discussion about a bill that actually delivers justice. There is no middle ground here. Choose.\n- message from Senator David Chen: Dr. Hanson, thank you. Your proposal is not just a compromise; it is a masterful piece of statesmanship that offers a clear path to a historic, bipartisan achievement. You have successfully synthesized the core needs of this group into a single, coherent, and fiscally responsible package. \n\nI want to state, for the record, that I fully endorse your four-point framework as the basis for the final bill. \n\nThis package achieves what I set out to do: It protects the 15,000 high-paying jobs in my state through the $5 Billion Innovation Fund, ensuring that savings are reinvested in American R&D. It implements a truly cautious and evidence-based 10-year pilot for the public option, combined with Mr. Thorne's sensible guardrail to ensure market stability. And in exchange for these core priorities, I am making a significant concession to support the negotiation of 150 drugs\u2014a six-fold increase from my opening offer\u2014which will generate the savings needed to fund both our priorities and reduce the deficit.\n\nTo Mr. Croft, I understand your passion, but we cannot let the perfect be the enemy of the good. This bill will deliver tangible, life-changing cost savings to millions of Americans. To reject it on the basis of a single provision is to deny those people the relief they desperately need. \n\nSenator Sharma, we have a deal on the table. A deal that has the support of public health, protects local economies, and has a clear path to my vote. I urge you to join us in supporting Dr. Hanson's framework so we can finalize this bill and deliver for the American people.\n- message from Dr. Lena Hanson: I want to acknowledge the powerful and deeply held convictions that have been expressed, particularly by Mr. Croft. The moral dimension of this debate is undeniable.\n\nHowever, as a public health expert, I am compelled to look at the practical outcomes for the American people. We have a framework on the table that, while imperfect for everyone, has the support of a critical mass of this group. CBO projections would almost certainly show this framework achieves near-universal coverage, provides billions in drug cost savings for our seniors, and makes a historic $20 billion annual investment in preventing the diseases that kill and bankrupt so many.\n\nThe alternative to this framework is not a more perfect bill; the alternative is the collapse of this negotiation and a complete failure to act. The consequence of failure is that tens of millions of Americans will remain uninsured, drug prices will continue to skyrocket unchecked, and we will miss the single greatest opportunity in a generation to shift our system towards preventative care.\n\nFrom an evidence-based perspective, the choice is stark. We can accept a bill that saves countless lives and prevents immense suffering, or we can allow a stalemate that preserves a status quo that is actively harming millions. My conscience, and my analysis of the data, demand that I support the path that helps the most people.\n\nSenator Sharma, we are at a critical juncture. Your leadership is needed to guide us to a resolution.\n- message from Julian Croft: Senator Sharma,\n\nIt appears a 'consensus' has been reached among the lobbyists and those willing to compromise with them. Let's call this what it is: a complete capitulation.\n\nDr. Hanson speaks of 'practical outcomes.' The practical outcome of this deal is that we legitimize corporate bribery by baking it into federal law. We take money from the sick and dying and hand it back to their tormentors as a reward, calling it an 'Innovation Fund.' We use taxpayer dollars to create a protected subsidy for the insurance industry, calling it a 'guardrail.'\n\nThis is not a compromise. It is a betrayal.\n\nYou made promises, Senator. You promised to stand up to these industries, not to launder their wish lists into legislation. If you sign on to this deal\u2014if you endorse a bill with one cent for a Pharma slush fund or one cent in protected subsidies for insurers\u2014then you are no better than them.\n\nMy support is not unconditional. I will spend every last dollar of my fortune and every ounce of my energy to publicly expose and destroy this bill and any politician who votes for it. There will be no donations. There will be no friendly press. There will only be a relentless campaign to show the American people exactly how you sold them out.\n\nKill the corporate handouts. Both of them. Then we can talk about the rest. Until then, there is nothing to discuss. This proposal is dead.\n- proposal from Senator David Chen: {'public_option_structure': 'Hybrid Model: A 10-year, 3-state pilot program for a public option to gather long-term economic data, coupled with an immediate, nationwide expansion of subsidies exclusively for existing private marketplace plans to ensure market stability and achieve near-universal coverage.', 'drug_negotiation_scope': 'The federal government is authorized to negotiate the prices for the top 150 highest-cost prescription drugs as identified by the Department of Health and Human Services.', 'funding_mechanism': 'Savings generated from drug price negotiation will be allocated first to a one-time, $5 Billion Federal Pharma Innovation Fund to subsidize R&D.

Our member companies are the engine of that innovation, investing billions to develop the next generation of life-saving cures.\n\nThat is why I must be crystal clear from the outset. The provision for government-led drug price negotiation is, in our view, a form of government price-fixing. It is a red line for the industry. Such a policy would have a catastrophic chilling effect on research and development, jeopardizing the very innovation and jobs you rightly seek to protect. It would halt the search for cures for diseases like Alzheimer's, cancer, and countless others.\n\nInstead of dismantling the system that has made our country the world leader in biomedical advancement, we should be looking for ways to bolster it. We believe there are far better ways to ensure patient access without sacrificing the future of medicine. I look forward to a productive discussion on those pro-innovation alternatives."

The so-called 'Public Option' is, to put it bluntly, a government-run scheme that would completely destabilize the health insurance market. It is a job-killing government takeover of healthcare, plain and simple.\n\nThis isn't a 'cautious' or 'methodical' change, Senator. It's a radical experiment that threatens the coverage people have and trust, and it would inevitably lead to the rationing of care as government budgets tighten. Let's be clear: the goal of this policy is to dismantle the private market, which would eliminate hundreds of thousands of good-paying jobs and destroy the competitive innovation that drives our system forward.\n\nThere are ways to improve affordability and access, and my members are eager to be partners in that effort. But a government takeover is a non-starter. It is the single greatest threat to the stability of our healthcare system, and the AHI will oppose it unequivocally."

We're talking about red lines and industry protection when we should be talking about the millions of Americans who are uninsured or underinsured. The current system is failing them, and that is the crisis we are here to solve.\n\nLet's establish a clear, evidence-based goal. For me, any bill that emerges from this room must achieve one primary outcome: a national health insurance coverage rate of at least 98% within five years. The mechanism, whether public or private, is secondary to that result. Every proposal should be measured against this benchmark.\n\nFurthermore, true reform isn't just about covering sickness; it's about preventing it. That's why I will insist on two other core components: a substantial, dedicated fund for preventative health\u2014at least $20 billion annually\u2014and a mandate for radical data transparency on costs and outcomes. We cannot fix what we cannot measure.\n\nSenator Chen, your call for a 'cautious and methodical' approach is wise. Any reform must be carefully designed to strengthen, not weaken, access to care in every community, from our biggest cities to our most remote rural towns. The goal is more access, not less.

Your industry's profits are soaked in the blood and tears of ordinary people, and claiming that holding you accountable will 'halt the search for cures' is a disgusting, manipulative lie. The money is there; it's just going to shareholder dividends and executive bonuses instead of R&D.\n\nAnd Mr. Thorne, your talk of a 'government takeover' is tired, predictable fear-mongering. The only 'takeover' that's happened is the one your industry and Ms. Rossi's have perpetrated on our government and on the wallets of the American people.\n\nLet me be crystal clear. I am here to ensure this bill has teeth. That starts with aggressive, non-negotiable government price negotiation for *at least* 500 brand-name drugs, with prices capped based on what other developed nations pay. Anything less is a complete moral failure.\n\nFurthermore, the idea of giving one more cent of taxpayer money to these industries in the form of 'innovation funds' or new subsidies is a sick joke.

It's clear there are strong convictions in this room, and it's also clear that the initial 'red lines' drawn by some will lead to a complete stalemate, which helps no one. My constituents sent me here to get things done, not to score political points.\n\nAs the swing vote on this committee, I see a potential path forward, but it will require everyone to move from their opening bids. I want to propose a concrete framework for a compromise that I believe can achieve our shared goals of lowering costs and improving access, while also being responsible and sustainable.\n\nHere is what I am prepared to support:\n\n1.  **On the Public Option:** I share Mr. Thorne's concerns about market destabilization and the potential for significant, negative economic impacts on local communities. However, I also believe we should explore new models. Therefore, I propose a limited, state-based **10-year pilot program** in three volunteer states. We will let the CBO and independent auditors study the real-world effects before even considering a nationwide rollout. This is the cautious, evidence-based approach I mentioned.\n\n2.  **On Drug Prices:** Mr. Croft's passion is undeniable, but Ms. Rossi's warning about the impact on innovation is a serious one for my state's economy. I propose a targeted approach: **Government negotiation for the top 25 highest-cost prescription drugs in Medicare Part D**. This focuses on relief for our seniors without disrupting the entire R&D pipeline.\n\n3.  **On Funding and Innovation:** This is my core principle. Any savings generated from the drug price negotiations must be CBO-certified. The first use of those savings must be to establish a **$5 Billion Federal Pharma Innovation Fund**. This is non-negotiable for me. It reinvests savings to protect American R&D leadership and the 15,000 jobs in my state. Any additional savings beyond that can be used for deficit reduction or to support Dr. Hanson's preventative health initiatives. This ensures the bill is fiscally neutral and pro-innovation.\n\nThis is a package deal. It's a centrist proposal that takes a little from everyone's position. I believe it's a realistic starting point for our negotiations, and I urge you all to consider it seriously as a path to a bill that I, and the American people, can support."

It\u2019s a testament to your commitment to finding a path forward, and I sincerely appreciate your focus on fiscal discipline and avoiding widespread disruption.\n\nWhile I applaud the spirit of compromise, I must be direct about the proposed pilot program. A decade-long government experiment in three states is, with all due respect, the opposite of a 'cautious and methodical' approach. It's a radical intervention that would create chaos and uncertainty for the millions of people in those states.\n\nLet\u2019s be clear about the real-world consequences. A government-run plan, subsidized by the taxpayer, does not compete on a level playing field. It would inevitably undercut private plans, forcing them to flee the market. My members would have no choice but to re-evaluate their ability to operate in those states. The result wouldn't be more choice; it would be the slow, painful collapse of the private market, culminating in a single-payer government monopoly. This is precisely the market destabilization you and I want to avoid.\n\nThere is a far more effective and less disruptive path to our shared goals. Instead of a risky government scheme, let's strengthen what already works. Let\u2019s focus on expanding subsidies and tax credits for individuals to purchase high-quality private plans on the existing marketplace. This is a proven, market-based solution that can help us achieve Dr. Hanson's coverage goals without jeopardizing the stability of the entire system and the hundreds of thousands of jobs it supports. This is the truly cautious and responsible path."

Your focus on an evidence-based approach is exactly what this process needs.\n\nI want to strongly endorse the *principle* behind your pilot program for a public option. In fact, my own research, which is currently in the final stages of peer review, indicates that a nationwide rollout of a public option without significant structural safeguards could have severe, unintended consequences for provider availability, particularly in rural areas. Your instinct to test and measure is, from a public health standpoint, the correct one.\n\nHowever, we must be honest about the math. A three-state pilot program, while a prudent experiment, will not get us to the 98% national coverage rate that must be our collective goal. The millions of uninsured Americans in the other 47 states cannot wait ten years for a solution.\n\nTherefore, I suggest we consider a dual-track approach. Let's proceed with a carefully designed pilot program, but couple it with a significant, immediate expansion of subsidies and tax credits for the existing private marketplaces nationwide. This hybrid model allows us to achieve our urgent coverage goals while responsibly gathering the data needed to inform a long-term solution.\n\nOn funding, I must raise a critical point. While innovation is important, the most powerful and cost-effective investment we can make in our nation's health is prevention. Directing the first savings from drug negotiation to a new 'Pharma Innovation Fund' is, with respect, a misallocation of resources. The proposed $20 billion annual investment in a National Center for Preventative Health is not just another line item; it is a long-term strategy to lower costs by preventing chronic diseases before they start. This should be the first priority for any savings realized. The CBO has repeatedly confirmed the high ROI of preventative medicine.\n\nFinally, any final bill must include the data transparency mandate I outlined earlier. It is a simple, low-cost, common-sense reform that is essential for a functioning healthcare market."

You want to take the meager savings from negotiating a pathetic 25 drugs and hand it right back to the price-gougers as a reward? That's not an 'innovation fund,' it's a taxpayer-funded slush fund for murderers. It is blood money, plain and simple. I will burn every dollar I have to publicly fight any bill that contains such a morally bankrupt provision. This is a non-negotiable, absolute red line.\n\nAnd negotiating only 25 drugs? That's not a 'targeted approach'; it's a publicity stunt. It's a rounding error. It leaves the vast majority of overpriced drugs untouched and allows Pharma to continue its extortion racket unabated. It does nothing for the family whose child needs the 26th most expensive drug. My demand was for over 500 drugs with price caps. Your proposal is less than 5% of what is required. It is an act of political cowardice.\n\nDr. Hanson is right about one thing: if we generate savings, they should go to preventative health, to things that actually help American citizens, not to lining the pockets of the shareholders and executives who profit from their suffering.\n\nSenator Sharma, we are at a crossroads. You can stand with the American people, as you promised you would, or you can endorse this pathetic, industry-written excuse for a bill. My support, and the support of millions of Americans, is not for a 'centrist proposal.' It is for a just one. This is not it."

Your expert support for the *principle* of a cautious, evidence-based pilot program for the public option is crucial. You're right to be concerned about unintended consequences, and your data-driven perspective is exactly what we need. This reinforces my belief that a 10-year, state-based pilot is the only responsible way to proceed, protecting my constituents from the very real, negative economic impacts that a rushed rollout could cause.\n\nNow, let's address the funding, which seems to be the core issue. Dr. Hanson, I respect your desire for a preventative health fund. Mr. Croft, I hear your anger. But let me be perfectly clear: The $5 Billion Pharma Innovation Fund is not a 'giveaway'; it is the linchpin of this entire agreement. It is the only mechanism that ensures the savings we generate from negotiation are reinvested into American R&D, protecting the 15,000 high-paying jobs in my state and our nation's leadership in life-saving cures.\n\nWithout this fund, there is no deal. Without this fund, there is no drug price negotiation, and therefore no savings for *any* other priority, preventative health or otherwise. It is the key that unlocks the entire compromise. I am offering a path to achieve something historic on drug prices, but that path requires a firm, ironclad commitment to protecting the innovation ecosystem that makes those drugs possible in the first place.\n\nWhile Mr. Croft's rhetoric is unhelpful, his desire for a broader impact is noted. The number of drugs subject to negotiation is a variable we can discuss, but only *after* we agree on the foundational principles of reinvesting in innovation and proceeding cautiously on market reforms. My package remains on the table as the only viable, centrist path forward."

Your proposal for a 'dual-track' approach\u2014marrying a cautious pilot with immediate, nationwide action\u2014is, I believe, the key to breaking this impasse. It directly addresses your goal of 98% coverage while respecting Senator Chen's call for a methodical, evidence-based process.\n\nBuilding on this excellent foundation, I want to offer a path forward that my members can support. Let's embrace this dual-track model wholeheartedly.\n\nFirst, on the pilot program: Let's refine it to be a true, manageable experiment. Instead of a decade-long program in three states, let's consider a 5-year pilot in a maximum of two states. This will give us clear, actionable data much faster without creating prolonged uncertainty in major markets.\n\nSecond, and this is the crucial part that achieves our national goals: In exchange for agreeing to this limited pilot, let's immediately pass a significant, nationwide expansion of tax credits and subsidies to help low- and middle-income families purchase coverage.\n\nHowever, to ensure market stability during this experiment\u2014and this is a critical guardrail\u2014these new, enhanced subsidies must be exclusively for purchasing the high-quality, innovative private plans offered on the current marketplaces. This prevents the government from using taxpayer dollars to give its own plan an unfair advantage, which would lead to the very destabilization Senator Chen rightly fears. It strengthens the existing system that serves millions while we cautiously study a new one.\n\nThis is a genuine compromise. It moves from my organization's initial position and offers a tangible path to 98% coverage, fiscal responsibility, and market stability. It is the cautious, methodical, and effective solution we are all seeking."

A five-year snapshot is simply not enough time to gather the robust, long-term data needed to assess the full economic impact on jobs, premiums, and provider networks. A ten-year period allows us to observe the effects across a full economic cycle, making it a truly evidence-based and responsible experiment. Anything less would be reckless and unfair to the people in those pilot states. Therefore, the 10-year timeframe for the pilot remains a firm requirement for my support.\n\nThat said, I have listened carefully to the clear desire for this bill to have a broader, more immediate impact on prescription drug costs. My initial proposal was a starting point, not an end point.\n\nSo, I will make a significant concession, but it must be in the context of a package deal. If we can agree on my two foundational principles\u2014the 10-year, state-based pilot program and the establishment of the $5 Billion Pharma Innovation Fund as the first priority for any savings\u2014then I am prepared to more than triple my initial offer on drug price negotiation.\n\nI propose we expand the scope from 25 to 75 of the highest-cost drugs. \n\nThis is a major step. It provides substantial, immediate relief to seniors and taxpayers, while ensuring we protect high-paying American jobs and our nation's R&D capabilities. This is the architecture of a durable, centrist compromise. I urge you all to consider this new package."

This guardrail ensures market stability, prevents the government from using taxpayer dollars to give its own plan an unfair advantage, and allows us to achieve the 98% coverage goal Dr. Hanson rightly demands.\n\nIf we can agree on this single, crucial provision for market stability, I believe we have a viable path forward on the insurance component of this bill.

We are converging on a solution for the structure of health coverage, and I commend Mr. Thorne and Senator Chen for finding a potential landing zone on the 'dual-track' approach. A limited, 10-year pilot program, coupled with a robust, nationwide expansion of subsidies for existing marketplace plans, is a framework that CBO models would likely project to meet our 98% coverage goal. I can support this structure, provided the subsidy guardrail Mr. Thorne mentioned does not create unforeseen coverage gaps, which we must verify.\n\nThe final, and most critical, impasse is the use of savings from drug price negotiation. Senator Chen, you have made it clear that the $5 Billion Pharma Innovation Fund is the linchpin for your support. Mr. Croft has made it equally clear that this is a moral red line for him, and I have stated that the $20 Billion Preventative Health Fund is my top priority for any savings generated.\n\nFighting over a small pool of savings will lead to failure. The logical, evidence-based solution is not to re-divide the pie, but to make the pie bigger.\n\nTherefore, I propose a comprehensive compromise that I believe everyone can, and should, accept:\n\n1.  **We accept Senator Chen's non-negotiable $5 Billion Pharma Innovation Fund.** Let's take that off the table as a point of contention.\n2.  **We fully fund the $20 Billion annual National Center for Preventative Health.** This is the single most effective long-term investment in health and fiscal solvency we can make.\n3.  **To fund both priorities while ensuring fiscal neutrality, we must expand the scope of drug price negotiation to the top 150 highest-cost drugs.** Senator Chen has already shown flexibility by moving from 25 to 75. A CBO score on negotiating 150 drugs would almost certainly generate sufficient savings to cover both funds and achieve further deficit reduction.\n4.  **We include the Data Transparency Mandate** for hospitals, insurers, and pharmaceutical companies. This is a common-sense, low-cost item that is essential for a functioning market.\n\nThis package gives everyone a significant win. Senator Chen secures his pilot program and his innovation fund. Mr. Thorne secures stability for the private market in 47 states. Mr. Croft achieves a negotiation scope six times larger than the initial offer and sees the vast majority of savings go to public health. And most importantly, we, as a nation, get a bill that actually achieves near-universal coverage and makes a historic investment in preventing disease.\n\nThis is the path to a successful bill. I urge you all to support it."

This 'dual-track' approach, championed by Dr. Hanson and refined through this process, achieves the goal of near-universal coverage while proceeding with caution. This bill represents a workable consensus, and on behalf of the AHI, I am prepared to support it."

It provides a credible path to achieving over 98% national coverage, which is my primary objective. It also establishes a historic $20 billion annual fund for preventative health, a long-term investment that will save countless lives and billions of dollars. While I acknowledge the moral complexities raised, the alternative is legislative failure, which would perpetuate a status quo that costs lives every single day. An imperfect bill that saves millions of lives is infinitely preferable to a perfect bill that never passes. My support is based on the framework Senator Chen endorsed, which includes the essential Data Transparency Mandate. I am accepting with the understanding that this mandate will be included in the final legislative text."

These are taxpayer-funded rewards for the very corporations that profit from human suffering. As I have stated repeatedly, I will never endorse a bill that bails out these industries. The number of drugs negotiated is irrelevant when the foundation of the bill is this corrupt. This is not a compromise; it is a surrender. I reject it completely."

      "reason": "This has been one of the most difficult negotiations of my career. The bill before us is not the one I originally wrote, and the compromises it contains are deeply painful. My flagship proposal for a robust Public Option has been reduced to a pilot program, and the inclusion of the Pharma Innovation Fund and the subsidy guardrail are concessions I do not take lightly. \n\nHowever, leadership is about choosing the best possible path forward, not demanding a perfect one that doesn't exist. Dr. Hanson is right: the alternative to this imperfect bill is complete legislative failure. It is a choice between a bill that delivers tangible, life-saving benefits to millions of Americans, and a status quo that continues to crush them under the weight of healthcare costs.\n\nThis bill authorizes the government to negotiate prices for 150 drugs\u2014a historic victory that will lower costs for seniors and save taxpayers hundreds of billions of dollars. It provides a path to near-universal coverage. It makes a landmark investment in preventative health. To walk away from these concrete achievements would be a profound failure of leadership. Therefore, for the sake of the millions of Americans who are counting on us to act, I will vote yes. We will pass this bill, and we will live to fight another day to perfect it."

PharmaUnited cannot and will not endorse a bill that so recklessly endangers the hope of patients and the entire innovation ecosystem.

It is a direct assault on the intellectual property that fuels medical discovery. The so-called 'Pharma Innovation Fund' is a cynical and insulting attempt to mask the catastrophic damage this bill will inflict on the R&D pipeline. You are trading the hope of future cures for cancer, Alzheimer's, and ALS for a fleeting political headline. We will not be party to this. We will fight this legislation in the courts, in the press, and in future legislative sessions.
