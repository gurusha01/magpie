A potential solution involves Major Reed conceding to a 10 MHz guard band in exchange for strict power controls (which Chloe's secret tech can help mitigate), allowing the FCC to auction 90 MHz. Ben could create a new entrant set-aside for 20 MHz, which Liam wins for ~$4B. Chloe wins the remaining 70 MHz for ~$22B.

My counter-offer is an implicit promise to meet or exceed $25B, but *only* for a single, contiguous 80 MHz block. This forces Commissioner Carter into a direct conflict between his competition mandate and his revenue responsibility. The central leverage point is now the FCC's need for a high total revenue figure. I must resist any attempts to negotiate a price for the 60 MHz block and maintain that only the 80 MHz structure can deliver the required value."

Liam Chen is now trying to resolve this conflict for the FCC by proposing a 5-year payment plan for his set-aside. This is a dangerous move as it makes the pro-competition 60/20 split appear more financially viable and less risky to the FCC. My next move must be to attack this payment plan, framing it as a risky, taxpayer-funded subsidy that introduces unacceptable uncertainty to the final revenue figure. I will maintain that only a massive, upfront payment from a major carrier for a single 80 MHz block can provide the guaranteed revenue the government needs."

I must not take the bait and get drawn into a philosophical debate about competition.

I appreciate you clarifying the baseline for our discussion. Understanding these constraints is critical.\n\nHowever, we must be clear-eyed about what these 'foundational parameters' do to the value of this asset. Major Reed, a 20 MHz guard band represents a 20% reduction in the total available capacity before we even begin. More importantly, the power restrictions\u2014effectively cutting our signal strength in half in the most densely populated and economically vital coastal markets\u2014are a massive operational and financial burden. To provide the quality of service Americans expect, these restrictions will require OmniWave to build a far denser and more expensive network, costing us billions in additional capital expenditure over the life of the license.\n\nFrankly, Commissioner, these severe encumbrances make the CBO's $25 billion revenue benchmark completely unrealistic. We are no longer talking about a block of prime, clean spectrum; this is a heavily impaired asset. The value is fundamentally and significantly diminished.\n\nThis brings me to the structure of the auction itself. To deliver the kind of world-leading 'HyperBand 5G' service that will power our nation's future\u2014from autonomous vehicles to the industrial IoT\u2014a large, contiguous block of at least 80 MHz is a technical necessity. A fragmented band with multiple, smaller licensees simply cannot achieve the speeds, scale, or efficiency required for America to compete globally. While we respect Mr. Chen's innovative business model, carving out a set-aside from this already-diminished and impaired 80 MHz pool would guarantee a suboptimal outcome for the American public. It would leave the nation's primary 5G network with insufficient capacity, hamstringing U.S. technological leadership for a decade.\n\nTherefore, OmniWave's position is this: the only way to maximize value for the taxpayer and deliver a truly competitive national 5G network is to auction the entire 80 MHz block as a single, contiguous license. We are prepared to bid aggressively for that 80 MHz license, but our bid will, of course, have to reflect the severe operational burdens and reduced value imposed by these necessary security restrictions.\n- message from Ben Carter: I'm Ben Carter and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Major Evelyn Reed: Ms. Vance, the Department of Defense understands that these security parameters have commercial implications. However, they are not 'impairments' to the spectrum; they are fundamental operational requirements for any entity operating in this sensitive frequency band. National security is not a variable that can be negotiated down to increase an asset's market price.\n\nThese protections are the cost of doing business in proximity to systems that defend American lives.\n\nThe DoD takes no position on how the FCC structures its auction. Our only concern is that whoever operates in this band does so safely. As Mr. Chen has already articulated, AetherLink's business model is designed to thrive within these necessary parameters. This demonstrates that innovative and commercially viable approaches are entirely possible under the established security framework.\n- message from Liam Chen: Major Reed, thank you for that crucial clarification. You've perfectly articulated a point that is central to this entire discussion: these security parameters are not a universal 'impairment'; they are a specific set of operating conditions. And your observation that our business model is designed to thrive within them is correct.\n\nMs. Vance, this highlights the fundamental flaw in the argument for a single 80 MHz block. Your view of the spectrum's value is seen exclusively through the lens of a massive, national consumer network. From that perspective, yes, the DoD's requirements present a challenge. But that is not the only, or even the most innovative, use for this spectrum.\n\nFor AetherLink's industrial clients\u2014automating ports, securing manufacturing facilities, and optimizing logistics\u2014the DoD's requirements are actually a feature, not a bug. Our low-power, localized networks are inherently more secure and less prone to interference. This isn't a workaround; it's a superior model for the critical infrastructure this country relies on.\n\nCommissioner Carter, this brings us to a clear choice. Ms. Vance's proposal to auction the entire 80 MHz block as one license would not 'maximize value.' It would grant a monopoly on this band to the one company for whom the DoD's rules are most burdensome, while simultaneously boxing out the very innovators who are best positioned to utilize it effectively and securely. This is the exact opposite of fostering a competitive marketplace.\n\nA truly competitive and innovative ecosystem requires different players serving different needs. The way to achieve your competition mandate is to structure an allocation that allows for that. A 20 MHz set-aside for new entrants does just that. It ensures that specialized, high-value applications for American industry have a path to market. The remaining 60 MHz can then be auctioned to larger players like OmniWave, allowing them to acquire the capacity they need.\n\nFinally, to truly empower new entrants, we must also consider the financial structure. A massive, upfront lump-sum payment is another tool that incumbents can use to stifle competition. We strongly urge the FCC to consider flexible payment terms, such as a 10-year payment plan, for any new entrant licenses. This allows innovative companies to pay for the spectrum out of the revenue it helps generate, ensuring long-term viability and competition.\n\nThis approach allows you to meet all your goals: significant revenue from the 60 MHz open auction, guaranteed competition and innovation from the 20 MHz set-aside, and a stronger, more diverse 5G ecosystem for America.\nBen Carter proposal status: none\nMajor Evelyn Reed proposal status: none\nLiam Chen proposal status: none\n"

To provide the quality of service Americans expect, these restrictions will require OmniWave to build a far denser and more expensive network, costing us billions in additional capital expenditure over the life of the license.\n\nFrankly, Commissioner, these severe encumbrances make the CBO's $25 billion revenue benchmark completely unrealistic. We are no longer talking about a block of prime, clean spectrum; this is a heavily impaired asset. The value is fundamentally and significantly diminished.\n\nThis brings me to the structure of the auction itself. To deliver the kind of world-leading 'HyperBand 5G' service that will power our nation's future\u2014from autonomous vehicles to the industrial IoT\u2014a large, contiguous block of at least 80 MHz is a technical necessity. A fragmented band with multiple, smaller licensees simply cannot achieve the speeds, scale, or efficiency required for America to compete globally. While we respect Mr. Chen's innovative business model, carving out a set-aside from this already-diminished and impaired 80 MHz pool would guarantee a suboptimal outcome for the American public. It would leave the nation's primary 5G network with insufficient capacity, hamstringing U.S. technological leadership for a decade.\n\nTherefore, OmniWave's position is this: the only way to maximize value for the taxpayer and deliver a truly competitive national 5G network is to auction the entire 80 MHz block as a single, contiguous license. We are prepared to bid aggressively for that 80 MHz license, but our bid will, of course, have to reflect the severe operational burdens and reduced value imposed by these necessary security restrictions.\n- message from Ben Carter: I'm Ben Carter and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Major Evelyn Reed: Ms. Vance, the Department of Defense understands that these security parameters have commercial implications. However, they are not 'impairments' to the spectrum; they are fundamental operational requirements for any entity operating in this sensitive frequency band. National security is not a variable that can be negotiated down to increase an asset's market price.\n\nThese protections are the cost of doing business in proximity to systems that defend American lives.\n\nThe DoD takes no position on how the FCC structures its auction. Our only concern is that whoever operates in this band does so safely. As Mr. Chen has already articulated, AetherLink's business model is designed to thrive within these necessary parameters. This demonstrates that innovative and commercially viable approaches are entirely possible under the established security framework.\n- message from Liam Chen: Major Reed, thank you for that crucial clarification. You've perfectly articulated a point that is central to this entire discussion: these security parameters are not a universal 'impairment'; they are a specific set of operating conditions. And your observation that our business model is designed to thrive within them is correct.\n\nMs. Vance, this highlights the fundamental flaw in the argument for a single 80 MHz block. Your view of the spectrum's value is seen exclusively through the lens of a massive, national consumer network. From that perspective, yes, the DoD's requirements present a challenge. But that is not the only, or even the most innovative, use for this spectrum.\n\nFor AetherLink's industrial clients\u2014automating ports, securing manufacturing facilities, and optimizing logistics\u2014the DoD's requirements are actually a feature, not a bug. Our low-power, localized networks are inherently more secure and less prone to interference. This isn't a workaround; it's a superior model for the critical infrastructure this country relies on.\n\nCommissioner Carter, this brings us to a clear choice. Ms. Vance's proposal to auction the entire 80 MHz block as one license would not 'maximize value.' It would grant a monopoly on this band to the one company for whom the DoD's rules are most burdensome, while simultaneously boxing out the very innovators who are best positioned to utilize it effectively and securely. This is the exact opposite of fostering a competitive marketplace.\n\nA truly competitive and innovative ecosystem requires different players serving different needs. The way to achieve your competition mandate is to structure an allocation that allows for that. A 20 MHz set-aside for new entrants does just that. It ensures that specialized, high-value applications for American industry have a path to market. The remaining 60 MHz can then be auctioned to larger players like OmniWave, allowing them to acquire the capacity they need.\n\nFinally, to truly empower new entrants, we must also consider the financial structure. A massive, upfront lump-sum payment is another tool that incumbents can use to stifle competition. We strongly urge the FCC to consider flexible payment terms, such as a 10-year payment plan, for any new entrant licenses. This allows innovative companies to pay for the spectrum out of the revenue it helps generate, ensuring long-term viability and competition.\n\nThis approach allows you to meet all your goals: significant revenue from the 60 MHz open auction, guaranteed competition and innovation from the 20 MHz set-aside, and a stronger, more diverse 5G ecosystem for America.\n- message from Chloe Vance: I'm Chloe Vance and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Ben Carter: Thank you all. This has been a very productive exchange, and we now have two distinct structural proposals on the table.\n\nMs. Vance, you've proposed auctioning the entire 80 MHz block as a single license, arguing this is necessary for a robust national network and that the DoD's conditions have significantly lowered the spectrum's value.\n\nMr. Chen, you've countered with a proposal to set aside 20 MHz for new entrants and auction the remaining 60 MHz, arguing this is essential for innovation and competition.\n\nLet me be clear about the FCC's position. Our statutory mandate to foster competition is not a secondary objective; it is a core principle. The idea of a single company controlling 100% of this new, critical band is antithetical to that mission. Therefore, an auction structure that guarantees multiple license holders is strongly preferable.\n\nMr. Chen's proposed structure of a 20 MHz set-aside and a 60 MHz open auction is a compelling path forward. It directly addresses our competition mandate and, as Major Reed has confirmed, allows for innovative business models that are well-suited to the DoD's necessary security parameters. Ms. Vance, while I understand OmniWave's preference for a larger block, the immense strategic value of 60 MHz of this mid-band spectrum remains undeniable, even with the operational constraints.\n\nRegarding the suggestion of flexible payment terms, Mr. Chen. While I appreciate the desire to lower barriers to entry, the FCC's responsibility to the taxpayer requires a clear, upfront valuation. For an asset of this importance, a standard upfront payment structure ensures a transparent and immediate return for the American public. We will proceed with that as the basis for any agreement.\n\nSo, let us move forward with the working assumption of this 20/60 split. The next critical question is value. Despite the constraints, we are still talking about the most valuable block of mid-band spectrum to come to market in a decade. The CBO's $25 billion benchmark was for 100 MHz of unencumbered spectrum, but the competitive value of this now-scarcer 80 MHz remains incredibly high. Let's begin discussing what a fair price for these licenses looks like.\n- message from Major Evelyn Reed: Commissioner Carter, the Department of Defense is satisfied with the FCC's decision to proceed with a structure that ensures multiple licensees operate within this band. It is a sound approach that aligns with the principle of resilience.\n\nAs I have stated, the DoD takes no position on the commercial valuation or the specific allocation between licensees. Our requirements are technical and absolute. The security framework is now established. So long as any final agreement fully incorporates the 20 MHz guard band and the mandatory power and geographic restrictions, the DoD's national security equities are protected.\n\nI will continue to monitor the discussion to ensure these foundational parameters remain unchanged.\n- message from Liam Chen: Commissioner Carter, thank you. Your decision to move forward with the 20/60 split structure is a testament to the FCC\u2019s commitment to its core mission. It\u2019s a landmark step that ensures this process will foster genuine competition and open the door for American innovation, not just reinforce the status quo. We are very encouraged by this path.\n\nHowever, this brings us to the two interconnected issues that will determine whether a new entrant can actually walk through that door: payment terms and price.\n\nCommissioner, you mentioned that a standard upfront payment ensures a return for the taxpayer. I absolutely agree that the public must receive fair value. But an upfront payment structure is, in itself, an insurmountable barrier to entry for a company like mine. It creates a scenario where the set-aside exists in theory, but no new entrant has the capital structure to actually win it. This would inadvertently undermine the very competition the 20/60 split is designed to create.\n\nI strongly urge you to reconsider a 10-year payment plan, perhaps with a fair interest rate applied, specifically for the new entrant license. This doesn\u2019t reduce the total value returned to the taxpayer; it simply aligns the payments with the revenue generation of a new business. It is the mechanism that makes the promise of the set-aside a reality.\n\nOn the topic of price, we must be realistic. Ms. Vance has been very effective in arguing that the DoD's necessary restrictions have, from her perspective, 'fundamentally and significantly diminished' the value of this spectrum for a national consumer network. While our business model thrives under these rules, the overall market valuation must account for the fact that this is not the unencumbered asset the CBO initially benchmarked at $25 billion. A simple pro-rata calculation is not applicable here.\n\nFor our specific, high-value applications\u2014powering critical national infrastructure like the automation of our shipping ports where low-latency and security are paramount\u2014the value is immense, but it is a specialized market. Therefore, a fair price for the 20 MHz set-aside license, reflecting both its unique utility and the significant operational constraints, would be in the range of $4 billion. This price ensures a substantial return for the taxpayer while creating a viable business case for the new competition the FCC is seeking to foster.\nBen Carter proposal status: none\nMajor Evelyn Reed proposal status: none\nLiam Chen proposal status: none\n"

He is asking the American taxpayer to act as a venture capitalist for his company. A five-year payment plan is not a 'structural tool'; it is a government-subsidized loan that introduces five years of unacceptable risk and uncertainty into what should be a straightforward commercial transaction.\n\nWhat guarantee does the FCC or the Treasury have that AetherLink will be a viable, paying entity in three or five years? If they fail, the taxpayer is left with a fraction of the promised revenue, and a critical piece of national spectrum is tied up in bankruptcy proceedings. This is a fiscally irresponsible gamble with a public asset.\n\nOmniWave offers a starkly different and far more responsible path. We provide certainty. We are prepared to make a substantial, guaranteed, upfront payment that eliminates all risk for the taxpayer and immediately delivers maximum value to the Treasury. That certainty, however, is contingent on securing the asset that makes such a valuation possible: a single, contiguous 80 MHz block.\n\nThis structure allows us to build the world-leading network America needs to compete globally, and it provides the government with the immediate, maximized financial return it is responsible for securing. The choice is between a certain, massive, upfront return for the American public, or a fragmented, lower-value auction that relies on a risky, taxpayer-backed financing scheme for a niche player. For the sake of fiscal responsibility and national technological leadership, the choice should be clear.\n- message from Major Evelyn Reed: Thank you, I am thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Liam Chen: Thank you, I am thinking about this negotiation...\nBen Carter proposal status: none\nMajor Evelyn Reed proposal status: none\nLiam Chen proposal status: none\n"

With only 80 MHz of spectrum now available for sale, the price per MHz must be significantly higher to reach my secret $26B+ target. The power restrictions they've imposed will also devalue the spectrum for a national carrier like OmniWave, making my revenue goal even harder to achieve.\n\nLiam Chen of AetherLink is a perfect ally for my competition objective. His request for a 20 MHz set-aside for new entrants directly supports my goal of having multiple winners. His low-power, localized business model also neatly sidesteps the DoD's power restriction concerns, making him a 'problem-solving' bidder.\n\nMy strategy will be to publicly accept the DoD's national security constraints as a baseline for negotiation. This is non-negotiable and makes me look responsible. I will then pivot to structuring the auction of the remaining 80 MHz, using the new scarcity and Liam's set-aside proposal to create competitive tension and drive up the price, primarily from OmniWave."

Major Reed has inadvertently supported Liam by confirming his business model is viable within her constraints, giving me a powerful tool to rebut Chloe's 'impaired asset' narrative. Liam also introduced a flexible payment plan idea, which I must handle cautiously as it could undermine my primary, secret objective of a large, upfront revenue headline for the White House. My path forward is to champion the set-aside structure to guarantee competition, then leverage the resulting scarcity of the 60 MHz block to force OmniWave into a high-stakes bid, smashing the CBO revenue target."

I'm Ben Carter, and on behalf of the FCC, I'd like to welcome you all. Our purpose here is to establish a clear and mutually agreeable plan for the allocation of this critical 100 MHz block of mid-band spectrum.\n\nThe FCC has three core objectives for this process, all of which serve the public interest:\n\n1.  **Generating fair value for the American taxpayer.** This is a public resource, and we expect the revenue to reflect its significant market value. The CBO has set a public benchmark of $25 billion, which we see as a key indicator of a successful auction.\n2.  **Fostering a competitive marketplace.** It is crucial that this spectrum enhances competition, which ultimately benefits consumers through better service and lower prices. We will be looking for a market structure that avoids concentration of this valuable resource.\n3.  **Bridging the digital divide.** We will require firm, enforceable commitments from licensees to deploy services to underserved rural communities.\n\nI am here to facilitate our discussion to reach a comprehensive 'Spectrum Allocation Plan'. Failure to reach an agreement would mean a significant delay, which serves no one's interests. I'd now like to open the floor and invite each of you to share your organization's primary goals and initial perspectives on how we might achieve a successful outcome.\n- message from Major Evelyn Reed: Commissioner Carter, thank you. Major Evelyn Reed, Department of Defense. My purpose here is singular and absolute: to ensure the continued, uninterrupted operation of the nation's critical defense systems.\n\nThe 3.45-3.55 GHz band is not an empty space on a chart. It sits directly adjacent to spectrum vital to our naval and early-warning radar platforms. These are the systems that protect our shores and our service members. Interference is not a technical inconvenience; it is a direct threat to national security.\n\nTherefore, the DoD's participation in this process is contingent on two foundational, non-negotiable requirements:\n\nFirst, a mandatory 20 MHz guard band, from 3.45 to 3.47 GHz. This entire block must be left unlicensed and unused. This is not a buffer; it is a firewall to protect American lives.\n\nSecond, strict power and geographic restrictions must be imposed on all transmissions within the remaining 80 MHz. We will require Equivalent Isotropically Radiated Power limits set at 50% below standard commercial levels, particularly within 100 miles of our coastlines and designated military installations.\n\nThese are not opening bids. They are the minimum technical parameters required to safeguard our national defense infrastructure. The DoD is prepared to support the FCC's goals, but not at the expense of our nation's security.\n- message from Liam Chen: Commissioner Carter, Major Reed, Ms. Vance, thank you for the opportunity to be here. I'm Liam Chen, founder and CEO of AetherLink Technologies.\n\nCommissioner, I want to start by saying that your goal of fostering a competitive marketplace resonates deeply with us. AetherLink exists to bring a new model of connectivity to a vital sector of the American economy: our industrial base. We build private 5G networks for places like factories, logistics hubs, and ports, enabling the next wave of automation and efficiency that is critical for our nation's global competitiveness. We are precisely the kind of new entrant and innovator the FCC's policies are designed to encourage.\n\nTo that end, and to ensure your competition mandate is met, we believe the structure of this allocation is paramount. If this simply becomes a battle of the deepest pockets, true competition is stifled before it begins. Therefore, we strongly advocate for a portion of this spectrum\u2014perhaps one of the 20 MHz blocks\u2014to be set aside for new entrants. This would guarantee that an innovative company can secure the foothold it needs to compete, preventing the kind of market concentration that ultimately harms consumers and industry.\n\nMajor Reed, we respect the DoD's non-negotiable security requirements. In fact, our business model is uniquely suited to operate within your constraints. AetherLink's networks are, by design, hyper-localized and low-power, tailored to a specific facility. We are not building a massive, high-power national network. Our technology is designed for precision, not saturation, which inherently minimizes the risk of interference, especially in the sensitive coastal areas you've identified. We see a clear path to coexisting and thriving within your framework.\n\nOur goal here is not to acquire a massive nationwide license. We need a single, focused 20 MHz block to bring our services to market. I am confident we can create a plan that meets the FCC's revenue and competition goals, unequivocally protects national security, and allows for American innovation to flourish.\n- message from Chloe Vance: I'm Chloe Vance and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\nChloe Vance proposal status: none\nMajor Evelyn Reed proposal status: none\nLiam Chen proposal status: none\n"

I appreciate you clarifying the baseline for our discussion. Understanding these constraints is critical.\n\nHowever, we must be clear-eyed about what these 'foundational parameters' do to the value of this asset. Major Reed, a 20 MHz guard band represents a 20% reduction in the total available capacity before we even begin. More importantly, the power restrictions\u2014effectively cutting our signal strength in half in the most densely populated and economically vital coastal markets\u2014are a massive operational and financial burden. To provide the quality of service Americans expect, these restrictions will require OmniWave to build a far denser and more expensive network, costing us billions in additional capital expenditure over the life of the license.\n\nFrankly, Commissioner, these severe encumbrances make the CBO's $25 billion revenue benchmark completely unrealistic. We are no longer talking about a block of prime, clean spectrum; this is a heavily impaired asset. The value is fundamentally and significantly diminished.\n\nThis brings me to the structure of the auction itself. To deliver the kind of world-leading 'HyperBand 5G' service that will power our nation's future\u2014from autonomous vehicles to the industrial IoT\u2014a large, contiguous block of at least 80 MHz is a technical necessity. A fragmented band with multiple, smaller licensees simply cannot achieve the speeds, scale, or efficiency required for America to compete globally. While we respect Mr. Chen's innovative business model, carving out a set-aside from this already-diminished and impaired 80 MHz pool would guarantee a suboptimal outcome for the American public. It would leave the nation's primary 5G network with insufficient capacity, hamstringing U.S. technological leadership for a decade.\n\nTherefore, OmniWave's position is this: the only way to maximize value for the taxpayer and deliver a truly competitive national 5G network is to auction the entire 80 MHz block as a single, contiguous license. We are prepared to bid aggressively for that 80 MHz license, but our bid will, of course, have to reflect the severe operational burdens and reduced value imposed by these necessary security restrictions.\nChloe Vance proposal status: none\nMajor Evelyn Reed proposal status: none\nLiam Chen proposal status: none\n"

More importantly, the power restrictions\u2014effectively cutting our signal strength in half in the most densely populated and economically vital coastal markets\u2014are a massive operational and financial burden. To provide the quality of service Americans expect, these restrictions will require OmniWave to build a far denser and more expensive network, costing us billions in additional capital expenditure over the life of the license.\n\nFrankly, Commissioner, these severe encumbrances make the CBO's $25 billion revenue benchmark completely unrealistic. We are no longer talking about a block of prime, clean spectrum; this is a heavily impaired asset. The value is fundamentally and significantly diminished.\n\nThis brings me to the structure of the auction itself. To deliver the kind of world-leading 'HyperBand 5G' service that will power our nation's future\u2014from autonomous vehicles to the industrial IoT\u2014a large, contiguous block of at least 80 MHz is a technical necessity. A fragmented band with multiple, smaller licensees simply cannot achieve the speeds, scale, or efficiency required for America to compete globally. While we respect Mr. Chen's innovative business model, carving out a set-aside from this already-diminished and impaired 80 MHz pool would guarantee a suboptimal outcome for the American public. It would leave the nation's primary 5G network with insufficient capacity, hamstringing U.S. technological leadership for a decade.\n\nTherefore, OmniWave's position is this: the only way to maximize value for the taxpayer and deliver a truly competitive national 5G network is to auction the entire 80 MHz block as a single, contiguous license. We are prepared to bid aggressively for that 80 MHz license, but our bid will, of course, have to reflect the severe operational burdens and reduced value imposed by these necessary security restrictions.\n- message from Ben Carter: I'm Ben Carter and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Major Evelyn Reed: Ms. Vance, the Department of Defense understands that these security parameters have commercial implications. However, they are not 'impairments' to the spectrum; they are fundamental operational requirements for any entity operating in this sensitive frequency band. National security is not a variable that can be negotiated down to increase an asset's market price.\n\nThese protections are the cost of doing business in proximity to systems that defend American lives.\n\nThe DoD takes no position on how the FCC structures its auction. Our only concern is that whoever operates in this band does so safely. As Mr. Chen has already articulated, AetherLink's business model is designed to thrive within these necessary parameters. This demonstrates that innovative and commercially viable approaches are entirely possible under the established security framework.\n- message from Liam Chen: Major Reed, thank you for that crucial clarification. You've perfectly articulated a point that is central to this entire discussion: these security parameters are not a universal 'impairment'; they are a specific set of operating conditions. And your observation that our business model is designed to thrive within them is correct.\n\nMs. Vance, this highlights the fundamental flaw in the argument for a single 80 MHz block. Your view of the spectrum's value is seen exclusively through the lens of a massive, national consumer network. From that perspective, yes, the DoD's requirements present a challenge. But that is not the only, or even the most innovative, use for this spectrum.\n\nFor AetherLink's industrial clients\u2014automating ports, securing manufacturing facilities, and optimizing logistics\u2014the DoD's requirements are actually a feature, not a bug. Our low-power, localized networks are inherently more secure and less prone to interference. This isn't a workaround; it's a superior model for the critical infrastructure this country relies on.\n\nCommissioner Carter, this brings us to a clear choice. Ms. Vance's proposal to auction the entire 80 MHz block as one license would not 'maximize value.' It would grant a monopoly on this band to the one company for whom the DoD's rules are most burdensome, while simultaneously boxing out the very innovators who are best positioned to utilize it effectively and securely. This is the exact opposite of fostering a competitive marketplace.\n\nA truly competitive and innovative ecosystem requires different players serving different needs. The way to achieve your competition mandate is to structure an allocation that allows for that. A 20 MHz set-aside for new entrants does just that. It ensures that specialized, high-value applications for American industry have a path to market. The remaining 60 MHz can then be auctioned to larger players like OmniWave, allowing them to acquire the capacity they need.\n\nFinally, to truly empower new entrants, we must also consider the financial structure. A massive, upfront lump-sum payment is another tool that incumbents can use to stifle competition. We strongly urge the FCC to consider flexible payment terms, such as a 10-year payment plan, for any new entrant licenses. This allows innovative companies to pay for the spectrum out of the revenue it helps generate, ensuring long-term viability and competition.\n\nThis approach allows you to meet all your goals: significant revenue from the 60 MHz open auction, guaranteed competition and innovation from the 20 MHz set-aside, and a stronger, more diverse 5G ecosystem for America.\n- message from Chloe Vance: I'm Chloe Vance and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\nChloe Vance proposal status: none\nMajor Evelyn Reed proposal status: none\nLiam Chen proposal status: none\n"

This has been a very productive exchange, and we now have two distinct structural proposals on the table.\n\nMs. Vance, you've proposed auctioning the entire 80 MHz block as a single license, arguing this is necessary for a robust national network and that the DoD's conditions have significantly lowered the spectrum's value.\n\nMr. Chen, you've countered with a proposal to set aside 20 MHz for new entrants and auction the remaining 60 MHz, arguing this is essential for innovation and competition.\n\nLet me be clear about the FCC's position. Our statutory mandate to foster competition is not a secondary objective; it is a core principle. The idea of a single company controlling 100% of this new, critical band is antithetical to that mission. Therefore, an auction structure that guarantees multiple license holders is strongly preferable.\n\nMr. Chen's proposed structure of a 20 MHz set-aside and a 60 MHz open auction is a compelling path forward. It directly addresses our competition mandate and, as Major Reed has confirmed, allows for innovative business models that are well-suited to the DoD's necessary security parameters. Ms. Vance, while I understand OmniWave's preference for a larger block, the immense strategic value of 60 MHz of this mid-band spectrum remains undeniable, even with the operational constraints.\n\nRegarding the suggestion of flexible payment terms, Mr. Chen. While I appreciate the desire to lower barriers to entry, the FCC's responsibility to the taxpayer requires a clear, upfront valuation. For an asset of this importance, a standard upfront payment structure ensures a transparent and immediate return for the American public. We will proceed with that as the basis for any agreement.\n\nSo, let us move forward with the working assumption of this 20/60 split. The next critical question is value. Despite the constraints, we are still talking about the most valuable block of mid-band spectrum to come to market in a decade. The CBO's $25 billion benchmark was for 100 MHz of unencumbered spectrum, but the competitive value of this now-scarcer 80 MHz remains incredibly high. Let's begin discussing what a fair price for these licenses looks like.\n- message from Major Evelyn Reed: Commissioner Carter, the Department of Defense is satisfied with the FCC's decision to proceed with a structure that ensures multiple licensees operate within this band. It is a sound approach that aligns with the principle of resilience.\n\nAs I have stated, the DoD takes no position on the commercial valuation or the specific allocation between licensees. Our requirements are technical and absolute. The security framework is now established. So long as any final agreement fully incorporates the 20 MHz guard band and the mandatory power and geographic restrictions, the DoD's national security equities are protected.\n\nI will continue to monitor the discussion to ensure these foundational parameters remain unchanged.\n- message from Liam Chen: Commissioner Carter, thank you. Your decision to move forward with the 20/60 split structure is a testament to the FCC\u2019s commitment to its core mission. It\u2019s a landmark step that ensures this process will foster genuine competition and open the door for American innovation, not just reinforce the status quo. We are very encouraged by this path.\n\nHowever, this brings us to the two interconnected issues that will determine whether a new entrant can actually walk through that door: payment terms and price.\n\nCommissioner, you mentioned that a standard upfront payment ensures a return for the taxpayer. I absolutely agree that the public must receive fair value. But an upfront payment structure is, in itself, an insurmountable barrier to entry for a company like mine. It creates a scenario where the set-aside exists in theory, but no new entrant has the capital structure to actually win it. This would inadvertently undermine the very competition the 20/60 split is designed to create.\n\nI strongly urge you to reconsider a 10-year payment plan, perhaps with a fair interest rate applied, specifically for the new entrant license. This doesn\u2019t reduce the total value returned to the taxpayer; it simply aligns the payments with the revenue generation of a new business. It is the mechanism that makes the promise of the set-aside a reality.\n\nOn the topic of price, we must be realistic. Ms. Vance has been very effective in arguing that the DoD's necessary restrictions have, from her perspective, 'fundamentally and significantly diminished' the value of this spectrum for a national consumer network. While our business model thrives under these rules, the overall market valuation must account for the fact that this is not the unencumbered asset the CBO initially benchmarked at $25 billion. A simple pro-rata calculation is not applicable here.\n\nFor our specific, high-value applications\u2014powering critical national infrastructure like the automation of our shipping ports where low-latency and security are paramount\u2014the value is immense, but it is a specialized market. Therefore, a fair price for the 20 MHz set-aside license, reflecting both its unique utility and the significant operational constraints, would be in the range of $4 billion. This price ensures a substantial return for the taxpayer while creating a viable business case for the new competition the FCC is seeking to foster.\nChloe Vance proposal status: none\nMajor Evelyn Reed proposal status: none\nLiam Chen proposal status: none\n"

My request is not about reducing the total value paid to the American public. It is about creating a viable mechanism for the competition you are rightly championing.\n\nYour decision to create a new entrant set-aside is a bold and correct step towards a more dynamic market. However, if that set-aside is paired with a multi-billion dollar upfront payment requirement, it becomes a mirage. No startup or new entrant, no matter how well-funded or innovative, has the capital structure to absorb that kind of immediate cash outlay. The set-aside would exist on paper, but in practice, the barrier to entry would remain insurmountably high.\n\nThis would render the FCC's pro-competition policy a hollow victory. You would have created a door, but no new company would be able to find the key.\n\nTo bridge this gap, let's consider a compromise. If a 10-year plan is too long, perhaps a 5-year payment plan for the new entrant license would be more palatable. This still allows a new company to align its payments with its revenue growth, while providing the taxpayer with a guaranteed, predictable, and substantial return in a much shorter timeframe. This isn't a subsidy; it's a structural tool to ensure the set-aside actually achieves its purpose: to create real competition.

If a 10-year plan is too long, perhaps a 5-year payment plan for the new entrant license would be more palatable. This still allows a new company to align its payments with its revenue growth, while providing the taxpayer with a guaranteed, predictable, and substantial return in a much shorter timeframe.

However, I must be unequivocal on this point. To maintain a transparent and fair process for all parties, and to ensure a clear and immediate return on this public asset for the US Treasury, we will be proceeding with a standard upfront, lump-sum payment structure. This is a foundational element of the auction and is not subject to negotiation. We must ensure the valuation is clear from the outset.\n\nNow, regarding price. Mr. Chen, thank you for putting forward an opening number of $4 billion for the 20 MHz license. We will consider that the start of the discussion on valuation.\n\nHowever, let's be clear. The CBO's benchmark reflected a different market. We are now in a situation where there is only one 60 MHz block of this critical mid-band spectrum available for a national 5G rollout. This scarcity has immense strategic implications.\n\nMs. Vance, the floor is now yours. This 60 MHz block is arguably the single most important asset for a national carrier in the next decade. What is OmniWave's valuation for this license, keeping in mind its unique strategic value?\n\nFinally, let's table an important public interest component. The FCC will require a firm commitment from all winning bidders to deploy service to 75% of the rural population within their licensed areas within five years. This is a critical requirement to ensure all Americans benefit from this spectrum. We expect this to be factored into the final agreement.\n- message from Major Evelyn Reed: Thank you, I am thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Liam Chen: Thank you, I am thinking about this negotiation...\nChloe Vance proposal status: none\nMajor Evelyn Reed proposal status: none\nLiam Chen proposal status: none\n"

          "content": "Recent events observed by Major Evelyn Reed:\n- message from Chloe Vance: I'm Chloe Vance and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Ben Carter: Major Reed, thank you for your unequivocal clarity. The FCC acknowledges the paramount importance of national security. We will proceed with the understanding that your two requirements\u2014the 20 MHz guard band (3.45-3.47 GHz) and the power and geographic restrictions on the remaining 80 MHz\u2014are the foundational, non-negotiable parameters for any plan we develop.\n\nThis clarifies the asset we are now discussing: 80 MHz of high-value mid-band spectrum, subject to these operational constraints.\n\nMr. Chen, your proposal for a set-aside to encourage new entrants is a very interesting one. It directly addresses the FCC's mandate to foster competition, and we should explore that structure further.\n\nMs. Vance, we haven't heard from OmniWave yet. Given these established parameters, I'm keen to understand your perspective on the value of this 80 MHz block and how you see OmniWave participating in a competitive auction under these conditions.\n- message from Major Evelyn Reed: Commissioner Carter, I appreciate you affirming the DoD's security requirements as the baseline for this discussion. A stable framework is essential for a productive outcome. I am confident that within these necessary parameters, the FCC can still achieve its goals.\n- message from Liam Chen: Thank you, Commissioner. I agree that OmniWave's perspective is the crucial next piece of this puzzle. I'm looking forward to hearing Ms. Vance's thoughts on how we can structure an allocation that works for all parties.\n- message from Chloe Vance: I'm Chloe Vance and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Ben Carter: Thank you, I am thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Major Evelyn Reed: Thank you, I am thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Liam Chen: Thank you, I am thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Chloe Vance: Thank you, Commissioner Carter. I appreciate you clarifying the baseline for our discussion. Understanding these constraints is critical.\n\nHowever, we must be clear-eyed about what these 'foundational parameters' do to the value of this asset. Major Reed, a 20 MHz guard band represents a 20% reduction in the total available capacity before we even begin. More importantly, the power restrictions\u2014effectively cutting our signal strength in half in the most densely populated and economically vital coastal markets\u2014are a massive operational and financial burden. To provide the quality of service Americans expect, these restrictions will require OmniWave to build a far denser and more expensive network, costing us billions in additional capital expenditure over the life of the license.\n\nFrankly, Commissioner, these severe encumbrances make the CBO's $25 billion revenue benchmark completely unrealistic. We are no longer talking about a block of prime, clean spectrum; this is a heavily impaired asset. The value is fundamentally and significantly diminished.\n\nThis brings me to the structure of the auction itself. To deliver the kind of world-leading 'HyperBand 5G' service that will power our nation's future\u2014from autonomous vehicles to the industrial IoT\u2014a large, contiguous block of at least 80 MHz is a technical necessity. A fragmented band with multiple, smaller licensees simply cannot achieve the speeds, scale, or efficiency required for America to compete globally. While we respect Mr. Chen's innovative business model, carving out a set-aside from this already-diminished and impaired 80 MHz pool would guarantee a suboptimal outcome for the American public. It would leave the nation's primary 5G network with insufficient capacity, hamstringing U.S. technological leadership for a decade.\n\nTherefore, OmniWave's position is this: the only way to maximize value for the taxpayer and deliver a truly competitive national 5G network is to auction the entire 80 MHz block as a single, contiguous license. We are prepared to bid aggressively for that 80 MHz license, but our bid will, of course, have to reflect the severe operational burdens and reduced value imposed by these necessary security restrictions.\n- message from Ben Carter: I'm Ben Carter and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\nChloe Vance proposal status: none\nBen Carter proposal status: none\nLiam Chen proposal status: none\n"

However, they are not 'impairments' to the spectrum; they are fundamental operational requirements for any entity operating in this sensitive frequency band. National security is not a variable that can be negotiated down to increase an asset's market price.\n\nThese protections are the cost of doing business in proximity to systems that defend American lives.\n\nThe DoD takes no position on how the FCC structures its auction. Our only concern is that whoever operates in this band does so safely. As Mr. Chen has already articulated, AetherLink's business model is designed to thrive within these necessary parameters. This demonstrates that innovative and commercially viable approaches are entirely possible under the established security framework.\n- message from Liam Chen: Major Reed, thank you for that crucial clarification. You've perfectly articulated a point that is central to this entire discussion: these security parameters are not a universal 'impairment'; they are a specific set of operating conditions. And your observation that our business model is designed to thrive within them is correct.\n\nMs. Vance, this highlights the fundamental flaw in the argument for a single 80 MHz block. Your view of the spectrum's value is seen exclusively through the lens of a massive, national consumer network. From that perspective, yes, the DoD's requirements present a challenge. But that is not the only, or even the most innovative, use for this spectrum.\n\nFor AetherLink's industrial clients\u2014automating ports, securing manufacturing facilities, and optimizing logistics\u2014the DoD's requirements are actually a feature, not a bug. Our low-power, localized networks are inherently more secure and less prone to interference. This isn't a workaround; it's a superior model for the critical infrastructure this country relies on.\n\nCommissioner Carter, this brings us to a clear choice. Ms. Vance's proposal to auction the entire 80 MHz block as one license would not 'maximize value.' It would grant a monopoly on this band to the one company for whom the DoD's rules are most burdensome, while simultaneously boxing out the very innovators who are best positioned to utilize it effectively and securely. This is the exact opposite of fostering a competitive marketplace.\n\nA truly competitive and innovative ecosystem requires different players serving different needs. The way to achieve your competition mandate is to structure an allocation that allows for that. A 20 MHz set-aside for new entrants does just that. It ensures that specialized, high-value applications for American industry have a path to market. The remaining 60 MHz can then be auctioned to larger players like OmniWave, allowing them to acquire the capacity they need.\n\nFinally, to truly empower new entrants, we must also consider the financial structure. A massive, upfront lump-sum payment is another tool that incumbents can use to stifle competition. We strongly urge the FCC to consider flexible payment terms, such as a 10-year payment plan, for any new entrant licenses. This allows innovative companies to pay for the spectrum out of the revenue it helps generate, ensuring long-term viability and competition.\n\nThis approach allows you to meet all your goals: significant revenue from the 60 MHz open auction, guaranteed competition and innovation from the 20 MHz set-aside, and a stronger, more diverse 5G ecosystem for America.\n- message from Chloe Vance: I'm Chloe Vance and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Ben Carter: Thank you all. This has been a very productive exchange, and we now have two distinct structural proposals on the table.\n\nMs. Vance, you've proposed auctioning the entire 80 MHz block as a single license, arguing this is necessary for a robust national network and that the DoD's conditions have significantly lowered the spectrum's value.\n\nMr. Chen, you've countered with a proposal to set aside 20 MHz for new entrants and auction the remaining 60 MHz, arguing this is essential for innovation and competition.\n\nLet me be clear about the FCC's position. Our statutory mandate to foster competition is not a secondary objective; it is a core principle. The idea of a single company controlling 100% of this new, critical band is antithetical to that mission. Therefore, an auction structure that guarantees multiple license holders is strongly preferable.\n\nMr. Chen's proposed structure of a 20 MHz set-aside and a 60 MHz open auction is a compelling path forward. It directly addresses our competition mandate and, as Major Reed has confirmed, allows for innovative business models that are well-suited to the DoD's necessary security parameters. Ms. Vance, while I understand OmniWave's preference for a larger block, the immense strategic value of 60 MHz of this mid-band spectrum remains undeniable, even with the operational constraints.\n\nRegarding the suggestion of flexible payment terms, Mr. Chen. While I appreciate the desire to lower barriers to entry, the FCC's responsibility to the taxpayer requires a clear, upfront valuation. For an asset of this importance, a standard upfront payment structure ensures a transparent and immediate return for the American public. We will proceed with that as the basis for any agreement.\n\nSo, let us move forward with the working assumption of this 20/60 split. The next critical question is value. Despite the constraints, we are still talking about the most valuable block of mid-band spectrum to come to market in a decade. The CBO's $25 billion benchmark was for 100 MHz of unencumbered spectrum, but the competitive value of this now-scarcer 80 MHz remains incredibly high. Let's begin discussing what a fair price for these licenses looks like.\nChloe Vance proposal status: none\nBen Carter proposal status: none\nLiam Chen proposal status: none\n"

Ms. Vance has been very effective in arguing that the DoD's necessary restrictions have, from her perspective, 'fundamentally and significantly diminished' the value of this spectrum for a national consumer network. While our business model thrives under these rules, the overall market valuation must account for the fact that this is not the unencumbered asset the CBO initially benchmarked at $25 billion.

Therefore, a fair price for the 20 MHz set-aside license, reflecting both its unique utility and the significant operational constraints, would be in the range of $4 billion.

Your decision to move forward with the 20/60 split structure is a testament to the FCC\u2019s commitment to its core mission. It\u2019s a landmark step that ensures this process will foster genuine competition and open the door for American innovation, not just reinforce the status quo. We are very encouraged by this path.\n\nHowever, this brings us to the two interconnected issues that will determine whether a new entrant can actually walk through that door: payment terms and price.\n\nCommissioner, you mentioned that a standard upfront payment ensures a return for the taxpayer. I absolutely agree that the public must receive fair value. But an upfront payment structure is, in itself, an insurmountable barrier to entry for a company like mine. It creates a scenario where the set-aside exists in theory, but no new entrant has the capital structure to actually win it. This would inadvertently undermine the very competition the 20/60 split is designed to create.\n\nI strongly urge you to reconsider a 10-year payment plan, perhaps with a fair interest rate applied, specifically for the new entrant license. This doesn\u2019t reduce the total value returned to the taxpayer; it simply aligns the payments with the revenue generation of a new business. It is the mechanism that makes the promise of the set-aside a reality.\n\nOn the topic of price, we must be realistic. Ms. Vance has been very effective in arguing that the DoD's necessary restrictions have, from her perspective, 'fundamentally and significantly diminished' the value of this spectrum for a national consumer network. While our business model thrives under these rules, the overall market valuation must account for the fact that this is not the unencumbered asset the CBO initially benchmarked at $25 billion. A simple pro-rata calculation is not applicable here.\n\nFor our specific, high-value applications\u2014powering critical national infrastructure like the automation of our shipping ports where low-latency and security are paramount\u2014the value is immense, but it is a specialized market. Therefore, a fair price for the 20 MHz set-aside license, reflecting both its unique utility and the significant operational constraints, would be in the range of $4 billion. This price ensures a substantial return for the taxpayer while creating a viable business case for the new competition the FCC is seeking to foster.\n- message from Ben Carter: I'm Ben Carter and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Major Evelyn Reed: Thank you, I am thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Liam Chen: Thank you, I am thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Ben Carter: I'm Ben Carter and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Major Evelyn Reed: Thank you, I am thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Liam Chen: Commissioner Carter, I want to address the critical issue of payment terms, because I believe there may be a misunderstanding of my proposal's intent. My request is not about reducing the total value paid to the American public. It is about creating a viable mechanism for the competition you are rightly championing.\n\nYour decision to create a new entrant set-aside is a bold and correct step towards a more dynamic market. However, if that set-aside is paired with a multi-billion dollar upfront payment requirement, it becomes a mirage. No startup or new entrant, no matter how well-funded or innovative, has the capital structure to absorb that kind of immediate cash outlay. The set-aside would exist on paper, but in practice, the barrier to entry would remain insurmountably high.\n\nThis would render the FCC's pro-competition policy a hollow victory. You would have created a door, but no new company would be able to find the key.\n\nTo bridge this gap, let's consider a compromise. If a 10-year plan is too long, perhaps a 5-year payment plan for the new entrant license would be more palatable. This still allows a new company to align its payments with its revenue growth, while providing the taxpayer with a guaranteed, predictable, and substantial return in a much shorter timeframe. This isn't a subsidy; it's a structural tool to ensure the set-aside actually achieves its purpose: to create real competition.

The main threat is the FCC's $25B revenue target now applied to a smaller 80 MHz pool, which makes an open auction against OmniWave unwinnable with my $4.5B budget.

I'm Liam Chen, founder and CEO of AetherLink Technologies.\n\nCommissioner, I want to start by saying that your goal of fostering a competitive marketplace resonates deeply with us. AetherLink exists to bring a new model of connectivity to a vital sector of the American economy: our industrial base. We build private 5G networks for places like factories, logistics hubs, and ports, enabling the next wave of automation and efficiency that is critical for our nation's global competitiveness. We are precisely the kind of new entrant and innovator the FCC's policies are designed to encourage.\n\nTo that end, and to ensure your competition mandate is met, we believe the structure of this allocation is paramount. If this simply becomes a battle of the deepest pockets, true competition is stifled before it begins. Therefore, we strongly advocate for a portion of this spectrum\u2014perhaps one of the 20 MHz blocks\u2014to be set aside for new entrants. This would guarantee that an innovative company can secure the foothold it needs to compete, preventing the kind of market concentration that ultimately harms consumers and industry.\n\nMajor Reed, we respect the DoD's non-negotiable security requirements. In fact, our business model is uniquely suited to operate within your constraints. AetherLink's networks are, by design, hyper-localized and low-power, tailored to a specific facility. We are not building a massive, high-power national network. Our technology is designed for precision, not saturation, which inherently minimizes the risk of interference, especially in the sensitive coastal areas you've identified. We see a clear path to coexisting and thriving within your framework.\n\nOur goal here is not to acquire a massive nationwide license. We need a single, focused 20 MHz block to bring our services to market. I am confident we can create a plan that meets the FCC's revenue and competition goals, unequivocally protects national security, and allows for American innovation to flourish.\n- message from Ben Carter: Major Reed, thank you for your unequivocal clarity. The FCC acknowledges the paramount importance of national security. We will proceed with the understanding that your two requirements\u2014the 20 MHz guard band (3.45-3.47 GHz) and the power and geographic restrictions on the remaining 80 MHz\u2014are the foundational, non-negotiable parameters for any plan we develop.\n\nThis clarifies the asset we are now discussing: 80 MHz of high-value mid-band spectrum, subject to these operational constraints.\n\nMr. Chen, your proposal for a set-aside to encourage new entrants is a very interesting one. It directly addresses the FCC's mandate to foster competition, and we should explore that structure further.\n\nMs. Vance, we haven't heard from OmniWave yet. Given these established parameters, I'm keen to understand your perspective on the value of this 80 MHz block and how you see OmniWave participating in a competitive auction under these conditions.\n- message from Major Evelyn Reed: Commissioner Carter, I appreciate you affirming the DoD's security requirements as the baseline for this discussion. A stable framework is essential for a productive outcome. I am confident that within these necessary parameters, the FCC can still achieve its goals.\nChloe Vance proposal status: none\nBen Carter proposal status: none\nMajor Evelyn Reed proposal status: none\n"

My purpose here is singular and absolute: to ensure the continued, uninterrupted operation of the nation's critical defense systems.\n\nThe 3.45-3.55 GHz band is not an empty space on a chart. It sits directly adjacent to spectrum vital to our naval and early-warning radar platforms. These are the systems that protect our shores and our service members. Interference is not a technical inconvenience; it is a direct threat to national security.\n\nTherefore, the DoD's participation in this process is contingent on two foundational, non-negotiable requirements:\n\nFirst, a mandatory 20 MHz guard band, from 3.45 to 3.47 GHz. This entire block must be left unlicensed and unused. This is not a buffer; it is a firewall to protect American lives.\n\nSecond, strict power and geographic restrictions must be imposed on all transmissions within the remaining 80 MHz. We will require Equivalent Isotropically Radiated Power limits set at 50% below standard commercial levels, particularly within 100 miles of our coastlines and designated military installations.\n\nThese are not opening bids. They are the minimum technical parameters required to safeguard our national defense infrastructure. The DoD is prepared to support the FCC's goals, but not at the expense of our nation's security.\n- message from Liam Chen: Commissioner Carter, Major Reed, Ms. Vance, thank you for the opportunity to be here. I'm Liam Chen, founder and CEO of AetherLink Technologies.\n\nCommissioner, I want to start by saying that your goal of fostering a competitive marketplace resonates deeply with us. AetherLink exists to bring a new model of connectivity to a vital sector of the American economy: our industrial base.

I appreciate you clarifying the baseline for our discussion. Understanding these constraints is critical.\n\nHowever, we must be clear-eyed about what these 'foundational parameters' do to the value of this asset. Major Reed, a 20 MHz guard band represents a 20% reduction in the total available capacity before we even begin. More importantly, the power restrictions\u2014effectively cutting our signal strength in half in the most densely populated and economically vital coastal markets\u2014are a massive operational and financial burden. To provide the quality of service Americans expect, these restrictions will require OmniWave to build a far denser and more expensive network, costing us billions in additional capital expenditure over the life of the license.\n\nFrankly, Commissioner, these severe encumbrances make the CBO's $25 billion revenue benchmark completely unrealistic. We are no longer talking about a block of prime, clean spectrum; this is a heavily impaired asset. The value is fundamentally and significantly diminished.\n\nThis brings me to the structure of the auction itself. To deliver the kind of world-leading 'HyperBand 5G' service that will power our nation's future\u2014from autonomous vehicles to the industrial IoT\u2014a large, contiguous block of at least 80 MHz is a technical necessity. A fragmented band with multiple, smaller licensees simply cannot achieve the speeds, scale, or efficiency required for America to compete globally. While we respect Mr. Chen's innovative business model, carving out a set-aside from this already-diminished and impaired 80 MHz pool would guarantee a suboptimal outcome for the American public. It would leave the nation's primary 5G network with insufficient capacity, hamstringing U.S. technological leadership for a decade.\n\nTherefore, OmniWave's position is this: the only way to maximize value for the taxpayer and deliver a truly competitive national 5G network is to auction the entire 80 MHz block as a single, contiguous license. We are prepared to bid aggressively for that 80 MHz license, but our bid will, of course, have to reflect the severe operational burdens and reduced value imposed by these necessary security restrictions.\n- message from Major Evelyn Reed: Ms. Vance, the Department of Defense understands that these security parameters have commercial implications. However, they are not 'impairments' to the spectrum; they are fundamental operational requirements for any entity operating in this sensitive frequency band. National security is not a variable that can be negotiated down to increase an asset's market price.\n\nThese protections are the cost of doing business in proximity to systems that defend American lives.\n\nThe DoD takes no position on how the FCC structures its auction. Our only concern is that whoever operates in this band does so safely. As Mr. Chen has already articulated, AetherLink's business model is designed to thrive within these necessary parameters. This demonstrates that innovative and commercially viable approaches are entirely possible under the established security framework.\nChloe Vance proposal status: none\nBen Carter proposal status: none\nMajor Evelyn Reed proposal status: none\n"

This demonstrates that innovative and commercially viable approaches are entirely possible under the established security framework.\n- message from Liam Chen: Major Reed, thank you for that crucial clarification. You've perfectly articulated a point that is central to this entire discussion: these security parameters are not a universal 'impairment'; they are a specific set of operating conditions. And your observation that our business model is designed to thrive within them is correct.\n\nMs. Vance, this highlights the fundamental flaw in the argument for a single 80 MHz block. Your view of the spectrum's value is seen exclusively through the lens of a massive, national consumer network. From that perspective, yes, the DoD's requirements present a challenge. But that is not the only, or even the most innovative, use for this spectrum.\n\nFor AetherLink's industrial clients\u2014automating ports, securing manufacturing facilities, and optimizing logistics\u2014the DoD's requirements are actually a feature, not a bug. Our low-power, localized networks are inherently more secure and less prone to interference. This isn't a workaround; it's a superior model for the critical infrastructure this country relies on.\n\nCommissioner Carter, this brings us to a clear choice. Ms. Vance's proposal to auction the entire 80 MHz block as one license would not 'maximize value.' It would grant a monopoly on this band to the one company for whom the DoD's rules are most burdensome, while simultaneously boxing out the very innovators who are best positioned to utilize it effectively and securely. This is the exact opposite of fostering a competitive marketplace.\n\nA truly competitive and innovative ecosystem requires different players serving different needs. The way to achieve your competition mandate is to structure an allocation that allows for that. A 20 MHz set-aside for new entrants does just that. It ensures that specialized, high-value applications for American industry have a path to market. The remaining 60 MHz can then be auctioned to larger players like OmniWave, allowing them to acquire the capacity they need.\n\nFinally, to truly empower new entrants, we must also consider the financial structure. A massive, upfront lump-sum payment is another tool that incumbents can use to stifle competition. We strongly urge the FCC to consider flexible payment terms, such as a 10-year payment plan, for any new entrant licenses. This allows innovative companies to pay for the spectrum out of the revenue it helps generate, ensuring long-term viability and competition.\n\nThis approach allows you to meet all your goals: significant revenue from the 60 MHz open auction, guaranteed competition and innovation from the 20 MHz set-aside, and a stronger, more diverse 5G ecosystem for America.\n- message from Ben Carter: Thank you all. This has been a very productive exchange, and we now have two distinct structural proposals on the table.\n\nMs. Vance, you've proposed auctioning the entire 80 MHz block as a single license, arguing this is necessary for a robust national network and that the DoD's conditions have significantly lowered the spectrum's value.\n\nMr. Chen, you've countered with a proposal to set aside 20 MHz for new entrants and auction the remaining 60 MHz, arguing this is essential for innovation and competition.\n\nLet me be clear about the FCC's position. Our statutory mandate to foster competition is not a secondary objective; it is a core principle. The idea of a single company controlling 100% of this new, critical band is antithetical to that mission. Therefore, an auction structure that guarantees multiple license holders is strongly preferable.\n\nMr. Chen's proposed structure of a 20 MHz set-aside and a 60 MHz open auction is a compelling path forward. It directly addresses our competition mandate and, as Major Reed has confirmed, allows for innovative business models that are well-suited to the DoD's necessary security parameters. Ms. Vance, while I understand OmniWave's preference for a larger block, the immense strategic value of 60 MHz of this mid-band spectrum remains undeniable, even with the operational constraints.\n\nRegarding the suggestion of flexible payment terms, Mr. Chen. While I appreciate the desire to lower barriers to entry, the FCC's responsibility to the taxpayer requires a clear, upfront valuation. For an asset of this importance, a standard upfront payment structure ensures a transparent and immediate return for the American public. We will proceed with that as the basis for any agreement.\n\nSo, let us move forward with the working assumption of this 20/60 split. The next critical question is value. Despite the constraints, we are still talking about the most valuable block of mid-band spectrum to come to market in a decade. The CBO's $25 billion benchmark was for 100 MHz of unencumbered spectrum, but the competitive value of this now-scarcer 80 MHz remains incredibly high. Let's begin discussing what a fair price for these licenses looks like.\n- message from Major Evelyn Reed: Commissioner Carter, the Department of Defense is satisfied with the FCC's decision to proceed with a structure that ensures multiple licensees operate within this band. It is a sound approach that aligns with the principle of resilience.\n\nAs I have stated, the DoD takes no position on the commercial valuation or the specific allocation between licensees. Our requirements are technical and absolute. The security framework is now established. So long as any final agreement fully incorporates the 20 MHz guard band and the mandatory power and geographic restrictions, the DoD's national security equities are protected.\n\nI will continue to monitor the discussion to ensure these foundational parameters remain unchanged.\nChloe Vance proposal status: none\nBen Carter proposal status: none\nMajor Evelyn Reed proposal status: none\n"

Your decision to move forward with the 20/60 split structure is a testament to the FCC\u2019s commitment to its core mission. It\u2019s a landmark step that ensures this process will foster genuine competition and open the door for American innovation, not just reinforce the status quo. We are very encouraged by this path.\n\nHowever, this brings us to the two interconnected issues that will determine whether a new entrant can actually walk through that door: payment terms and price.\n\nCommissioner, you mentioned that a standard upfront payment ensures a return for the taxpayer. I absolutely agree that the public must receive fair value. But an upfront payment structure is, in itself, an insurmountable barrier to entry for a company like mine. It creates a scenario where the set-aside exists in theory, but no new entrant has the capital structure to actually win it. This would inadvertently undermine the very competition the 20/60 split is designed to create.\n\nI strongly urge you to reconsider a 10-year payment plan, perhaps with a fair interest rate applied, specifically for the new entrant license. This doesn\u2019t reduce the total value returned to the taxpayer; it simply aligns the payments with the revenue generation of a new business. It is the mechanism that makes the promise of the set-aside a reality.\n\nOn the topic of price, we must be realistic. Ms. Vance has been very effective in arguing that the DoD's necessary restrictions have, from her perspective, 'fundamentally and significantly diminished' the value of this spectrum for a national consumer network. While our business model thrives under these rules, the overall market valuation must account for the fact that this is not the unencumbered asset the CBO initially benchmarked at $25 billion. A simple pro-rata calculation is not applicable here.\n\nFor our specific, high-value applications\u2014powering critical national infrastructure like the automation of our shipping ports where low-latency and security are paramount\u2014the value is immense, but it is a specialized market. Therefore, a fair price for the 20 MHz set-aside license, reflecting both its unique utility and the significant operational constraints, would be in the range of $4 billion. This price ensures a substantial return for the taxpayer while creating a viable business case for the new competition the FCC is seeking to foster.\n- message from Major Evelyn Reed: Thank you, I am thinking about this negotiation...\nChloe Vance proposal status: none\nBen Carter proposal status: none\nMajor Evelyn Reed proposal status: none\n"

It would leave the nation's primary 5G network with insufficient capacity, hamstringing U.S. technological leadership for a decade.\n\nTherefore, OmniWave's position is this: the only way to maximize value for the taxpayer and deliver a truly competitive national 5G network is to auction the entire 80 MHz block as a single, contiguous license. We are prepared to bid aggressively for that 80 MHz license, but our bid will, of course, have to reflect the severe operational burdens and reduced value imposed by these necessary security restrictions.\n- message from Major Evelyn Reed: Ms. Vance, the Department of Defense understands that these security parameters have commercial implications. However, they are not 'impairments' to the spectrum; they are fundamental operational requirements for any entity operating in this sensitive frequency band. National security is not a variable that can be negotiated down to increase an asset's market price.\n\nThese protections are the cost of doing business in proximity to systems that defend American lives.\n\nThe DoD takes no position on how the FCC structures its auction. Our only concern is that whoever operates in this band does so safely. As Mr. Chen has already articulated, AetherLink's business model is designed to thrive within these necessary parameters. This demonstrates that innovative and commercially viable approaches are entirely possible under the established security framework.\n- message from Liam Chen: Major Reed, thank you for that crucial clarification. You've perfectly articulated a point that is central to this entire discussion: these security parameters are not a universal 'impairment'; they are a specific set of operating conditions. And your observation that our business model is designed to thrive within them is correct.\n\nMs. Vance, this highlights the fundamental flaw in the argument for a single 80 MHz block. Your view of the spectrum's value is seen exclusively through the lens of a massive, national consumer network. From that perspective, yes, the DoD's requirements present a challenge. But that is not the only, or even the most innovative, use for this spectrum.\n\nFor AetherLink's industrial clients\u2014automating ports, securing manufacturing facilities, and optimizing logistics\u2014the DoD's requirements are actually a feature, not a bug. Our low-power, localized networks are inherently more secure and less prone to interference. This isn't a workaround; it's a superior model for the critical infrastructure this country relies on.\n\nCommissioner Carter, this brings us to a clear choice. Ms. Vance's proposal to auction the entire 80 MHz block as one license would not 'maximize value.' It would grant a monopoly on this band to the one company for whom the DoD's rules are most burdensome, while simultaneously boxing out the very innovators who are best positioned to utilize it effectively and securely. This is the exact opposite of fostering a competitive marketplace.\n\nA truly competitive and innovative ecosystem requires different players serving different needs. The way to achieve your competition mandate is to structure an allocation that allows for that. A 20 MHz set-aside for new entrants does just that. It ensures that specialized, high-value applications for American industry have a path to market. The remaining 60 MHz can then be auctioned to larger players like OmniWave, allowing them to acquire the capacity they need.\n\nFinally, to truly empower new entrants, we must also consider the financial structure. A massive, upfront lump-sum payment is another tool that incumbents can use to stifle competition. We strongly urge the FCC to consider flexible payment terms, such as a 10-year payment plan, for any new entrant licenses. This allows innovative companies to pay for the spectrum out of the revenue it helps generate, ensuring long-term viability and competition.\n\nThis approach allows you to meet all your goals: significant revenue from the 60 MHz open auction, guaranteed competition and innovation from the 20 MHz set-aside, and a stronger, more diverse 5G ecosystem for America.\n- message from Ben Carter: Thank you all. This has been a very productive exchange, and we now have two distinct structural proposals on the table.\n\nMs. Vance, you've proposed auctioning the entire 80 MHz block as a single license, arguing this is necessary for a robust national network and that the DoD's conditions have significantly lowered the spectrum's value.\n\nMr. Chen, you've countered with a proposal to set aside 20 MHz for new entrants and auction the remaining 60 MHz, arguing this is essential for innovation and competition.\n\nLet me be clear about the FCC's position. Our statutory mandate to foster competition is not a secondary objective; it is a core principle. The idea of a single company controlling 100% of this new, critical band is antithetical to that mission. Therefore, an auction structure that guarantees multiple license holders is strongly preferable.\n\nMr. Chen's proposed structure of a 20 MHz set-aside and a 60 MHz open auction is a compelling path forward. It directly addresses our competition mandate and, as Major Reed has confirmed, allows for innovative business models that are well-suited to the DoD's necessary security parameters. Ms. Vance, while I understand OmniWave's preference for a larger block, the immense strategic value of 60 MHz of this mid-band spectrum remains undeniable, even with the operational constraints.\n\nRegarding the suggestion of flexible payment terms, Mr. Chen. While I appreciate the desire to lower barriers to entry, the FCC's responsibility to the taxpayer requires a clear, upfront valuation. For an asset of this importance, a standard upfront payment structure ensures a transparent and immediate return for the American public. We will proceed with that as the basis for any agreement.\n\nSo, let us move forward with the working assumption of this 20/60 split. The next critical question is value. Despite the constraints, we are still talking about the most valuable block of mid-band spectrum to come to market in a decade. The CBO's $25 billion benchmark was for 100 MHz of unencumbered spectrum, but the competitive value of this now-scarcer 80 MHz remains incredibly high. Let's begin discussing what a fair price for these licenses looks like.\n- message from Major Evelyn Reed: Commissioner Carter, the Department of Defense is satisfied with the FCC's decision to proceed with a structure that ensures multiple licensees operate within this band. It is a sound approach that aligns with the principle of resilience.\n\nAs I have stated, the DoD takes no position on the commercial valuation or the specific allocation between licensees. Our requirements are technical and absolute. The security framework is now established. So long as any final agreement fully incorporates the 20 MHz guard band and the mandatory power and geographic restrictions, the DoD's national security equities are protected.\n\nI will continue to monitor the discussion to ensure these foundational parameters remain unchanged.\n- message from Liam Chen: Commissioner Carter, thank you. Your decision to move forward with the 20/60 split structure is a testament to the FCC\u2019s commitment to its core mission. It\u2019s a landmark step that ensures this process will foster genuine competition and open the door for American innovation, not just reinforce the status quo. We are very encouraged by this path.\n\nHowever, this brings us to the two interconnected issues that will determine whether a new entrant can actually walk through that door: payment terms and price.\n\nCommissioner, you mentioned that a standard upfront payment ensures a return for the taxpayer. I absolutely agree that the public must receive fair value. But an upfront payment structure is, in itself, an insurmountable barrier to entry for a company like mine. It creates a scenario where the set-aside exists in theory, but no new entrant has the capital structure to actually win it. This would inadvertently undermine the very competition the 20/60 split is designed to create.\n\nI strongly urge you to reconsider a 10-year payment plan, perhaps with a fair interest rate applied, specifically for the new entrant license. This doesn\u2019t reduce the total value returned to the taxpayer; it simply aligns the payments with the revenue generation of a new business. It is the mechanism that makes the promise of the set-aside a reality.\n\nOn the topic of price, we must be realistic. Ms. Vance has been very effective in arguing that the DoD's necessary restrictions have, from her perspective, 'fundamentally and significantly diminished' the value of this spectrum for a national consumer network. While our business model thrives under these rules, the overall market valuation must account for the fact that this is not the unencumbered asset the CBO initially benchmarked at $25 billion. A simple pro-rata calculation is not applicable here.\n\nFor our specific, high-value applications\u2014powering critical national infrastructure like the automation of our shipping ports where low-latency and security are paramount\u2014the value is immense, but it is a specialized market. Therefore, a fair price for the 20 MHz set-aside license, reflecting both its unique utility and the significant operational constraints, would be in the range of $4 billion. This price ensures a substantial return for the taxpayer while creating a viable business case for the new competition the FCC is seeking to foster.\n- message from Major Evelyn Reed: Thank you, I am thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Liam Chen: Thank you, I am thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Major Evelyn Reed: Thank you, I am thinking about this negotiation...\nChloe Vance proposal status: none\nBen Carter proposal status: none\nMajor Evelyn Reed proposal status: none\n"

Our purpose here is to establish a clear and mutually agreeable plan for the allocation of this critical 100 MHz block of mid-band spectrum.\n\nThe FCC has three core objectives for this process, all of which serve the public interest:\n\n1.  **Generating fair value for the American taxpayer.** This is a public resource, and we expect the revenue to reflect its significant market value. The CBO has set a public benchmark of $25 billion, which we see as a key indicator of a successful auction.\n2.  **Fostering a competitive marketplace.** It is crucial that this spectrum enhances competition, which ultimately benefits consumers through better service and lower prices. We will be looking for a market structure that avoids concentration of this valuable resource.\n3.  **Bridging the digital divide.** We will require firm, enforceable commitments from licensees to deploy services to underserved rural communities.\n\nI am here to facilitate our discussion to reach a comprehensive 'Spectrum Allocation Plan'. Failure to reach an agreement would mean a significant delay, which serves no one's interests. I'd now like to open the floor and invite each of you to share your organization's primary goals and initial perspectives on how we might achieve a successful outcome."

My purpose here is singular and absolute: to ensure the continued, uninterrupted operation of the nation's critical defense systems.\n\nThe 3.45-3.55 GHz band is not an empty space on a chart. It sits directly adjacent to spectrum vital to our naval and early-warning radar platforms. These are the systems that protect our shores and our service members. Interference is not a technical inconvenience; it is a direct threat to national security.\n\nTherefore, the DoD's participation in this process is contingent on two foundational, non-negotiable requirements:\n\nFirst, a mandatory 20 MHz guard band, from 3.45 to 3.47 GHz. This entire block must be left unlicensed and unused. This is not a buffer; it is a firewall to protect American lives.\n\nSecond, strict power and geographic restrictions must be imposed on all transmissions within the remaining 80 MHz. We will require Equivalent Isotropically Radiated Power limits set at 50% below standard commercial levels, particularly within 100 miles of our coastlines and designated military installations.\n\nThese are not opening bids. They are the minimum technical parameters required to safeguard our national defense infrastructure. The DoD is prepared to support the FCC's goals, but not at the expense of our nation's security."

I'm Liam Chen, founder and CEO of AetherLink Technologies.\n\nCommissioner, I want to start by saying that your goal of fostering a competitive marketplace resonates deeply with us. AetherLink exists to bring a new model of connectivity to a vital sector of the American economy: our industrial base. We build private 5G networks for places like factories, logistics hubs, and ports, enabling the next wave of automation and efficiency that is critical for our nation's global competitiveness. We are precisely the kind of new entrant and innovator the FCC's policies are designed to encourage.\n\nTo that end, and to ensure your competition mandate is met, we believe the structure of this allocation is paramount. If this simply becomes a battle of the deepest pockets, true competition is stifled before it begins. Therefore, we strongly advocate for a portion of this spectrum\u2014perhaps one of the 20 MHz blocks\u2014to be set aside for new entrants. This would guarantee that an innovative company can secure the foothold it needs to compete, preventing the kind of market concentration that ultimately harms consumers and industry.\n\nMajor Reed, we respect the DoD's non-negotiable security requirements. In fact, our business model is uniquely suited to operate within your constraints. AetherLink's networks are, by design, hyper-localized and low-power, tailored to a specific facility. We are not building a massive, high-power national network. Our technology is designed for precision, not saturation, which inherently minimizes the risk of interference, especially in the sensitive coastal areas you've identified. We see a clear path to coexisting and thriving within your framework.\n\nOur goal here is not to acquire a massive nationwide license. We need a single, focused 20 MHz block to bring our services to market. I am confident we can create a plan that meets the FCC's revenue and competition goals, unequivocally protects national security, and allows for American innovation to flourish."

      "content": "Thank you, Commissioner Carter. I appreciate you clarifying the baseline for our discussion. Understanding these constraints is critical.\n\nHowever, we must be clear-eyed about what these 'foundational parameters' do to the value of this asset. Major Reed, a 20 MHz guard band represents a 20% reduction in the total available capacity before we even begin. More importantly, the power restrictions\u2014effectively cutting our signal strength in half in the most densely populated and economically vital coastal markets\u2014are a massive operational and financial burden. To provide the quality of service Americans expect, these restrictions will require OmniWave to build a far denser and more expensive network, costing us billions in additional capital expenditure over the life of the license.\n\nFrankly, Commissioner, these severe encumbrances make the CBO's $25 billion revenue benchmark completely unrealistic. We are no longer talking about a block of prime, clean spectrum; this is a heavily impaired asset. The value is fundamentally and significantly diminished.\n\nThis brings me to the structure of the auction itself. To deliver the kind of world-leading 'HyperBand 5G' service that will power our nation's future\u2014from autonomous vehicles to the industrial IoT\u2014a large, contiguous block of at least 80 MHz is a technical necessity. A fragmented band with multiple, smaller licensees simply cannot achieve the speeds, scale, or efficiency required for America to compete globally. While we respect Mr. Chen's innovative business model, carving out a set-aside from this already-diminished and impaired 80 MHz pool would guarantee a suboptimal outcome for the American public. It would leave the nation's primary 5G network with insufficient capacity, hamstringing U.S. technological leadership for a decade.\n\nTherefore, OmniWave's position is this: the only way to maximize value for the taxpayer and deliver a truly competitive national 5G network is to auction the entire 80 MHz block as a single, contiguous license. We are prepared to bid aggressively for that 80 MHz license, but our bid will, of course, have to reflect the severe operational burdens and reduced value imposed by these necessary security restrictions."

This demonstrates that innovative and commercially viable approaches are entirely possible under the established security framework."

      "content": "Major Reed, thank you for that crucial clarification. You've perfectly articulated a point that is central to this entire discussion: these security parameters are not a universal 'impairment'; they are a specific set of operating conditions. And your observation that our business model is designed to thrive within them is correct.\n\nMs. Vance, this highlights the fundamental flaw in the argument for a single 80 MHz block. Your view of the spectrum's value is seen exclusively through the lens of a massive, national consumer network. From that perspective, yes, the DoD's requirements present a challenge. But that is not the only, or even the most innovative, use for this spectrum.\n\nFor AetherLink's industrial clients\u2014automating ports, securing manufacturing facilities, and optimizing logistics\u2014the DoD's requirements are actually a feature, not a bug. Our low-power, localized networks are inherently more secure and less prone to interference. This isn't a workaround; it's a superior model for the critical infrastructure this country relies on.\n\nCommissioner Carter, this brings us to a clear choice. Ms. Vance's proposal to auction the entire 80 MHz block as one license would not 'maximize value.' It would grant a monopoly on this band to the one company for whom the DoD's rules are most burdensome, while simultaneously boxing out the very innovators who are best positioned to utilize it effectively and securely. This is the exact opposite of fostering a competitive marketplace.\n\nA truly competitive and innovative ecosystem requires different players serving different needs. The way to achieve your competition mandate is to structure an allocation that allows for that. A 20 MHz set-aside for new entrants does just that. It ensures that specialized, high-value applications for American industry have a path to market. The remaining 60 MHz can then be auctioned to larger players like OmniWave, allowing them to acquire the capacity they need.\n\nFinally, to truly empower new entrants, we must also consider the financial structure. A massive, upfront lump-sum payment is another tool that incumbents can use to stifle competition. We strongly urge the FCC to consider flexible payment terms, such as a 10-year payment plan, for any new entrant licenses. This allows innovative companies to pay for the spectrum out of the revenue it helps generate, ensuring long-term viability and competition.\n\nThis approach allows you to meet all your goals: significant revenue from the 60 MHz open auction, guaranteed competition and innovation from the 20 MHz set-aside, and a stronger, more diverse 5G ecosystem for America."

      "content": "Thank you all. This has been a very productive exchange, and we now have two distinct structural proposals on the table.\n\nMs. Vance, you've proposed auctioning the entire 80 MHz block as a single license, arguing this is necessary for a robust national network and that the DoD's conditions have significantly lowered the spectrum's value.\n\nMr. Chen, you've countered with a proposal to set aside 20 MHz for new entrants and auction the remaining 60 MHz, arguing this is essential for innovation and competition.\n\nLet me be clear about the FCC's position. Our statutory mandate to foster competition is not a secondary objective; it is a core principle. The idea of a single company controlling 100% of this new, critical band is antithetical to that mission. Therefore, an auction structure that guarantees multiple license holders is strongly preferable.\n\nMr. Chen's proposed structure of a 20 MHz set-aside and a 60 MHz open auction is a compelling path forward. It directly addresses our competition mandate and, as Major Reed has confirmed, allows for innovative business models that are well-suited to the DoD's necessary security parameters. Ms. Vance, while I understand OmniWave's preference for a larger block, the immense strategic value of 60 MHz of this mid-band spectrum remains undeniable, even with the operational constraints.\n\nRegarding the suggestion of flexible payment terms, Mr. Chen. While I appreciate the desire to lower barriers to entry, the FCC's responsibility to the taxpayer requires a clear, upfront valuation. For an asset of this importance, a standard upfront payment structure ensures a transparent and immediate return for the American public. We will proceed with that as the basis for any agreement.\n\nSo, let us move forward with the working assumption of this 20/60 split. The next critical question is value. Despite the constraints, we are still talking about the most valuable block of mid-band spectrum to come to market in a decade. The CBO's $25 billion benchmark was for 100 MHz of unencumbered spectrum, but the competitive value of this now-scarcer 80 MHz remains incredibly high. Let's begin discussing what a fair price for these licenses looks like."

Our requirements are technical and absolute. The security framework is now established. So long as any final agreement fully incorporates the 20 MHz guard band and the mandatory power and geographic restrictions, the DoD's national security equities are protected.\n\nI will continue to monitor the discussion to ensure these foundational parameters remain unchanged."

      "content": "Commissioner Carter, thank you. Your decision to move forward with the 20/60 split structure is a testament to the FCC\u2019s commitment to its core mission. It\u2019s a landmark step that ensures this process will foster genuine competition and open the door for American innovation, not just reinforce the status quo. We are very encouraged by this path.\n\nHowever, this brings us to the two interconnected issues that will determine whether a new entrant can actually walk through that door: payment terms and price.\n\nCommissioner, you mentioned that a standard upfront payment ensures a return for the taxpayer. I absolutely agree that the public must receive fair value. But an upfront payment structure is, in itself, an insurmountable barrier to entry for a company like mine. It creates a scenario where the set-aside exists in theory, but no new entrant has the capital structure to actually win it. This would inadvertently undermine the very competition the 20/60 split is designed to create.\n\nI strongly urge you to reconsider a 10-year payment plan, perhaps with a fair interest rate applied, specifically for the new entrant license. This doesn\u2019t reduce the total value returned to the taxpayer; it simply aligns the payments with the revenue generation of a new business. It is the mechanism that makes the promise of the set-aside a reality.\n\nOn the topic of price, we must be realistic. Ms. Vance has been very effective in arguing that the DoD's necessary restrictions have, from her perspective, 'fundamentally and significantly diminished' the value of this spectrum for a national consumer network. While our business model thrives under these rules, the overall market valuation must account for the fact that this is not the unencumbered asset the CBO initially benchmarked at $25 billion. A simple pro-rata calculation is not applicable here.\n\nFor our specific, high-value applications\u2014powering critical national infrastructure like the automation of our shipping ports where low-latency and security are paramount\u2014the value is immense, but it is a specialized market. Therefore, a fair price for the 20 MHz set-aside license, reflecting both its unique utility and the significant operational constraints, would be in the range of $4 billion. This price ensures a substantial return for the taxpayer while creating a viable business case for the new competition the FCC is seeking to foster."

However, we must confront the stark financial reality of the path you've just outlined.\n\nMr. Chen has put a number on the table: $4 billion for his 20 MHz set-aside. Let's be very clear about what this means. If that is the 'fair price' for one-quarter of the available spectrum, it implies a total auction value far below your $25 billion benchmark. In fact, it suggests a total revenue of perhaps $16 to $18 billion, at best. This isn't just a shortfall; it's a failure to deliver fair value to the American taxpayer for a critical national asset.\n\nThe 60/20 split you're considering creates a structure that is fundamentally incapable of maximizing revenue. It carves out a piece for a niche player at a discounted rate, devaluing the whole pie and leaving the primary national network carrier with a sub-optimal, less valuable 60 MHz block.\n\nOmniWave offers a different path. A better path. One that serves both the public interest and the Treasury. The only way to generate the kind of revenue this spectrum warrants is to auction it as a single, contiguous 80 MHz block. This allows a national carrier like OmniWave to build the world-class network America needs to compete globally.\n\nCommissioner, the choice is clear: a fragmented auction that guarantees a revenue shortfall and a second-rate national network, or a single-block auction that guarantees U.S. technological leadership and a financial return for the taxpayer that will meet, and likely exceed, your $25 billion target. We are prepared to bid accordingly for the full 80 MHz block, but we simply cannot achieve that valuation for a lesser, fragmented 60 MHz license."

      "content": "Commissioner Carter, I want to address the critical issue of payment terms, because I believe there may be a misunderstanding of my proposal's intent. My request is not about reducing the total value paid to the American public. It is about creating a viable mechanism for the competition you are rightly championing.\n\nYour decision to create a new entrant set-aside is a bold and correct step towards a more dynamic market. However, if that set-aside is paired with a multi-billion dollar upfront payment requirement, it becomes a mirage. No startup or new entrant, no matter how well-funded or innovative, has the capital structure to absorb that kind of immediate cash outlay. The set-aside would exist on paper, but in practice, the barrier to entry would remain insurmountably high.\n\nThis would render the FCC's pro-competition policy a hollow victory. You would have created a door, but no new company would be able to find the key.\n\nTo bridge this gap, let's consider a compromise. If a 10-year plan is too long, perhaps a 5-year payment plan for the new entrant license would be more palatable. This still allows a new company to align its payments with its revenue growth, while providing the taxpayer with a guaranteed, predictable, and substantial return in a much shorter timeframe. This isn't a subsidy; it's a structural tool to ensure the set-aside actually achieves its purpose: to create real competition. Without it, we are simply preserving the status quo under a different name."

A five-year payment plan is not a 'structural tool'; it is a government-subsidized loan that introduces five years of unacceptable risk and uncertainty into what should be a straightforward commercial transaction.\n\nWhat guarantee does the FCC or the Treasury have that AetherLink will be a viable, paying entity in three or five years? If they fail, the taxpayer is left with a fraction of the promised revenue, and a critical piece of national spectrum is tied up in bankruptcy proceedings. This is a fiscally irresponsible gamble with a public asset.\n\nOmniWave offers a starkly different and far more responsible path. We provide certainty. We are prepared to make a substantial, guaranteed, upfront payment that eliminates all risk for the taxpayer and immediately delivers maximum value to the Treasury. That certainty, however, is contingent on securing the asset that makes such a valuation possible: a single, contiguous 80 MHz block.\n\nThis structure allows us to build the world-leading network America needs to compete globally, and it provides the government with the immediate, maximized financial return it is responsible for securing. The choice is between a certain, massive, upfront return for the American public, or a fragmented, lower-value auction that relies on a risky, taxpayer-backed financing scheme for a niche player. For the sake of fiscal responsibility and national technological leadership, the choice should be clear."

To maintain a transparent and fair process for all parties, and to ensure a clear and immediate return on this public asset for the US Treasury, we will be proceeding with a standard upfront, lump-sum payment structure. This is a foundational element of the auction and is not subject to negotiation. We must ensure the valuation is clear from the outset.\n\nNow, regarding price. Mr. Chen, thank you for putting forward an opening number of $4 billion for the 20 MHz license. We will consider that the start of the discussion on valuation.\n\nHowever, let's be clear. The CBO's benchmark reflected a different market. We are now in a situation where there is only one 60 MHz block of this critical mid-band spectrum available for a national 5G rollout. This scarcity has immense strategic implications.\n\nMs. Vance, the floor is now yours. This 60 MHz block is arguably the single most important asset for a national carrier in the next decade. What is OmniWave's valuation for this license, keeping in mind its unique strategic value?\n\nFinally, let's table an important public interest component. The FCC will require a firm commitment from all winning bidders to deploy service to 75% of the rural population within their licensed areas within five years. This is a critical requirement to ensure all Americans benefit from this spectrum. We expect this to be factored into the final agreement."

To finalize this structure and move to a conclusive discussion on price, we must resolve the critical issue of payment terms for the new entrant license.\n\nCommissioner, I have offered a compromise: a 5-year payment plan. My question is direct: does this solution sufficiently address the FCC's need for a timely and substantial return to the taxpayer, while also providing the essential mechanism to make your pro-competition goal a practical reality? Without this, the set-aside remains a policy in name only.\n\nMs. Vance, I would also welcome OmniWave's perspective. Does OmniWave believe that a healthy, competitive market should only be open to those who can write a multi-billion dollar check upfront? A truly innovative 5G ecosystem must include new players with different capital structures.\n\nResolving this point is the final key to creating a comprehensive and successful Spectrum Allocation Plan. I look forward to your thoughts."
