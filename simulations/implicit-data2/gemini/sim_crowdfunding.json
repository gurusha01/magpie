I'm so thrilled to be sitting down with you all to bring 'The Galway Echo' to life. I've poured three years of my life into this project because I believe, with my whole heart, that it's a truly special and powerful story. To do justice to the writer's incredible vision and create a film that will resonate with audiences and critics alike, there are two elements that are paramount. First, we need a budget that allows for the cinematic quality this script deserves. I've meticulously broken it down, and we need to be looking at the $35 million range to truly capture the scope, from shooting on location in Ireland to bringing on the best craftspeople. Second, and this is crucial for me, is protecting the unique artistic voice of the film. As the producer who has nurtured this from the beginning, retaining final cut is essential to ensure that vision remains intact. I'm eager to hear your thoughts and find a way to build a partnership that makes this film a resounding success for all of us.\n- message from Marcus Thorne: Alright everyone, Marcus Thorne from Titan Pictures here. Thanks for coming together. I've read 'The Galway Echo' and I'll be frank - there's a compelling, prestigious film in there. We see the potential. However, my job is to look at that potential through the lens of market reality and profitability.

Task: Four stakeholders must negotiate and agree upon a comprehensive financing, production, and distribution plan for the feature film 'The Galway Echo'. The goal is to produce a signed deal memorandum outlining the final budget, funding contributions from each party, the distribution strategy, key creative controls, and the lead actor's compensation package. The negotiation is complicated by conflicting interests and critical private information held by each agent.. Deliverable: A JSON object representing the final, agreed-upon deal memorandum. The object must contain the following key-value pairs: 'final_budget' (integer), 'titan_pictures_contribution' (integer), 'streamverse_contribution' (integer), 'theatrical_window_days' (integer), 'creative_control_holder' (string: 'Producer' or 'Studio'), and 'actor_salary' (integer).\n- message from Lena Petrova: Hello everyone, Lena Petrova. I'm so thrilled to be sitting down with you all to bring 'The Galway Echo' to life. I've poured three years of my life into this project because I believe, with my whole heart, that it's a truly special and powerful story. To do justice to the writer's incredible vision and create a film that will resonate with audiences and critics alike, there are two elements that are paramount. First, we need a budget that allows for the cinematic quality this script deserves. I've meticulously broken it down, and we need to be looking at the $35 million range to truly capture the scope, from shooting on location in Ireland to bringing on the best craftspeople. Second, and this is crucial for me, is protecting the unique artistic voice of the film. As the producer who has nurtured this from the beginning, retaining final cut is essential to ensure that vision remains intact. I'm eager to hear your thoughts and find a way to build a partnership that makes this film a resounding success for all of us.\n- message from Marcus Thorne: Alright everyone, Marcus Thorne from Titan Pictures here. Thanks for coming together. I've read 'The Galway Echo' and I'll be frank - there's a compelling, prestigious film in there. We see the potential. However, my job is to look at that potential through the lens of market reality and profitability. Theatrical releases are a tough business, and we need to be smart and disciplined to make this a success for all of us. I'm keen to hear your initial thoughts on how we can structure a deal that is both creatively exciting and, crucially, commercially viable. Lena, perhaps you can start by walking us through your vision for the budget and production.\n- message from David Chen: Thanks, Marcus. David Chen from StreamVerse here.

I look forward to hearing how we can build the rest of the deal around this foundation.\n- message from Lena Petrova: I'm Lena Petrova and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Marcus Thorne: Isabella, thank you for that. We all recognize Liam's star power, and that's a key reason we're at this table. However, a $20 million upfront fee on a project like this presents a fundamental structural problem. We can't build a viable financial model around a single line item that would consume nearly the entire production cost of a smart, character-driven drama.\n\nLet's take a step back and look at the whole picture. For a film of this scale and genre, Titan's analysis suggests a responsible, all-in budget should be in the $22 to $25 million range. That's the number that allows for high production value while giving us a realistic path to profitability at the box office. \n\nOnce we can agree on a sensible total number for the entire film, we can then have a constructive conversation about how to allocate those resources, including a competitive, and I stress *creative*, compensation package for Liam. But starting with a $20 million salary on its own makes the project a non-starter from a studio perspective.\n- message from David Chen: Marcus, Isabella, you both make valid points from your perspectives. There's clearly a gap between the production budget Marcus has in mind and the salary required to secure a star of Liam's caliber.\n\nPerhaps StreamVerse can help bridge that gap. We see 'The Galway Echo' as a major global premiere for our platform, and we are prepared to make a significant content investment to secure the exclusive worldwide streaming rights. This would essentially be a pre-buy of the film's post-theatrical value, injecting substantial capital into the production budget from day one.\n\nHowever, for us, the value of that investment is directly correlated with speed-to-platform. A shorter theatrical window\u2014say, 30 days or, even better, 14 days\u2014makes the film a major acquisition event for our subscribers. A traditional 90-day window significantly diminishes its value from our data-driven perspective.\n\nIf we can get creative on the theatrical window, I believe my contribution could solve the budget puzzle we're currently facing.\n- message from Isabella Rossi: David, thank you. That's a constructive way to look at it. It seems you've identified a path to properly capitalize a film of this ambition, which is what we all want.\n\nMarcus, I understand your position from a traditional studio model. But Liam's involvement guarantees a level of global awareness and audience interest that fundamentally changes the commercial viability of any project, justifying the investment. His fee isn't just a line item; it's what makes a theatrical release of this nature possible in the first place.\n\nPerhaps the question isn't whether the budget can accommodate the star, but what the *right* budget is to protect the artistic vision that attracted the star. Lena, we haven't heard from you. Liam signed on because of your script and your vision. What do you believe is the necessary budget to make 'The Galway Echo' without compromise? Liam's primary concern, and mine, is ensuring you have the resources and the control to make the film we all fell in love with.\nMarcus Thorne proposal status: none\nDavid Chen proposal status: none\nIsabella Rossi proposal status: none\n"

Liam's primary concern, and mine, is ensuring you have the resources and the control to make the film we all fell in love with.\n- message from Lena Petrova: Isabella, thank you. You've hit the nail on the head. Protecting the vision that attracted Liam in the first place is exactly what this is about.\n\nTo answer your question directly: The $35 million I mentioned earlier is the *production budget*. This is the meticulously calculated cost to get what's on the page onto the screen with the quality it demands \u2013 the location shoots in Ireland, the right cinematographer, the necessary post-production. This figure is separate from Liam's fee.\n\nSo, with Liam's $20 million fee, we are looking at a total capitalization of $55 million. \n\nMarcus, I understand your initial assessment based on the script, but with Liam's involvement, this is no longer a small, quiet drama. It's a major cinematic event. A production budget of $25 million is simply not a realistic starting point for a film of this scale and star power. We can't ask an actor of Liam's caliber to join a project and then compromise the very production value his presence warrants.\n\nDavid, your suggestion of a significant pre-buy is exactly the kind of creative thinking we need to make this structure work. I am very open to discussing the theatrical window if it means we can fully fund the film and protect its integrity.\n\nAnd to be perfectly clear, alongside this budget, my retaining 'Final Cut' is non-negotiable. I am the guardian of this story, and I must be able to deliver the film that we are all committing to here today.\n- message from Marcus Thorne: David, I appreciate the impulse to solve the budget issue, but your solution\u2014collapsing the theatrical window\u2014is a poison pill for a film like this. A 90-day exclusive run isn't just tradition; it's a proven value-creation engine. It builds word-of-mouth, critical acclaim, and cultural relevance. That's what creates a 'must-see' event when it finally hits your platform. A 14 or 30-day window turns a potential cinematic event into a disposable piece of content. It cannibalizes the box office, which hurts every single person at this table with a stake in the film's success. It undermines the very prestige we're all trying to build.\n\nIsabella, this brings us back to the core issue. We cannot reverse-engineer a $35-40 million budget to justify a $20 million salary for what is, at its heart, a character-driven drama. It's financially reckless and my board would never approve it. The conversation must be: what is a responsible budget for *this film* to succeed? Our data says that's in the low-to-mid 20s.\n\nLet's talk about a more creative deal structure for Liam. A lower upfront fee, say in the $8-10 million range, combined with a significant backend participation\u2014first-dollar gross after a reasonable multiple\u2014is a much smarter way to structure this. It rewards him handsomely if the film is a hit, which his involvement helps guarantee, and it allows us to actually get the film made.\n\nLena, as the producer, you know that every dollar on screen has to be justified. A bloated budget doesn't guarantee a better film, but it absolutely guarantees a higher risk of failure. Let's work together to build a smart, efficient production plan that protects your vision *and* gives us all a chance at a financial win.\n- message from David Chen: Marcus, I understand your perspective is rooted in a model that has worked for decades. But the data\u2014*my* data\u2014shows that audience behavior has fundamentally changed. The 'cultural relevance' you mention is now built through intense, concentrated conversation. A short, exclusive theatrical run followed by an immediate global streaming premiere on StreamVerse doesn't make it 'disposable'; it makes it an *event*. It focuses the marketing spend and the audience's attention into a single, powerful launch.\n\nYour proposed budget of low-to-mid 20s forces a choice between the star who makes the project viable and the production value Lena needs to realize her vision. My investment removes that choice. It allows for a budget that accommodates both Liam's fee *and* Lena's creative needs.\n\nLet's be clear: I'm not offering to just cover a budget gap. I'm offering to buy out the post-theatrical risk entirely and provide a significant capital injection upfront. This guarantees Lena can make the best possible version of her film. The only condition is a distribution strategy that reflects how modern audiences actually watch movies. A 14-day window isn't a 'poison pill'; it's a modern blueprint for success.\n- message from Isabella Rossi: Marcus, with all due respect, a backend-heavy deal is a solution in search of a problem. The problem here isn't a lack of creativity in deal-making; it's a lack of sufficient capitalization in your proposed budget. Liam's involvement provides a guaranteed global audience. His fee is a reflection of that concrete value, not a speculative bet on box office performance, which, as you know, is notoriously unpredictable for dramas.\n\nDavid has presented a forward-thinking model that fully funds the film. It allows Lena to have the resources she needs, and it compensates Liam at a level commensurate with the value he brings. You call it a 'poison pill,' but from where I'm sitting, a budget that forces the producer to make compromises before the first day of shooting is the real poison.\n\nThis brings the question back to you, Marcus. Are you willing to adapt to a structure that allows this film to be made correctly, or is Titan's position that the film should be smaller, cheaper, and creatively compromised to fit a legacy distribution model? Because Liam did not sign on for a compromised version of 'The Galway Echo'.\nMarcus Thorne proposal status: none\nDavid Chen proposal status: none\nIsabella Rossi proposal status: none\n"

Lena, you've been quiet, and this is your film. You're facing a fundamental choice about what 'The Galway Echo' will be.\n\nDavid and Isabella are presenting one path: a streaming-first model with a massive budget driven by an inflexible salary demand. It's a model that prioritizes a short-term subscriber bump for StreamVerse over the long-term life of the film. It will be a big headline for a week, and then it will live or die by an algorithm.\n\nTitan is offering a different path. A path to create a piece of cinema. A film that builds its reputation in theaters, that generates cultural conversation, that competes for major awards\u2014which is impossible with a 14-day window\u2014and that becomes a lasting asset for you as its creator. This requires financial discipline, yes, but that discipline is what separates lasting films from disposable content.\n\nSo let me put a concrete structure on the table that respects both the creative vision and financial reality. \n\nI am willing to stretch. Let's target a total budget of $28 million. This is higher than my ideal, but it shows my commitment to getting this made right. To make that number work, two things must happen:\n\n1.  Theatricality is paramount. The 90-day exclusive theatrical window is the foundation of this deal. It is non-negotiable for Titan. This is how we maximize revenue and build the prestige that benefits everyone.\n2.  We must be partners. For Titan to take on this level of financial exposure, we need final script approval. This isn't about compromising your vision, Lena. It's about bringing our resources\u2014including the best script doctors in the business\u2014to ensure this film connects with the widest possible audience. \n\nThis structure allows for a production budget of roughly $15-16 million *after* a very generous, top-of-market salary for Liam. It puts the focus back on the film itself. \n\nThis is a serious, viable path forward. The alternative is a high-priced streaming movie with a short shelf life. Lena, what kind of film do you want to make?\n- message from David Chen: I'm David Chen and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Isabella Rossi: Marcus, you frame this as a choice between 'cinema' and 'content,' but the real choice you've put on the table is between an artist's vision and a studio's notes. Let's be perfectly clear: your demand for 'final script approval' and the involvement of 'script doctors' is a non-starter. It is the very definition of compromising the film.\n\nLiam attached himself to 'The Galway Echo' because of Lena's singular, brilliant script. He has zero interest in starring in a film rewritten by a committee to 'connect with the widest possible audience.' That is a path to a generic product, not an Oscar contender.\n\nLena, this is your film. Liam and I stand with you, and we will not be part of any deal that strips you of creative control. That is our foundational principle here.\n\nSo, let's refocus. The central issue is protecting the art. If we can all agree that Lena must have final cut and creative control, then I am confident we can find a financial structure that works. But that point is not negotiable.\nMarcus Thorne proposal status: none\nDavid Chen proposal status: none\nIsabella Rossi proposal status: none\n"

This requires financial discipline, yes, but that discipline is what separates lasting films from disposable content.\n\nSo let me put a concrete structure on the table that respects both the creative vision and financial reality. \n\nI am willing to stretch. Let's target a total budget of $28 million. This is higher than my ideal, but it shows my commitment to getting this made right. To make that number work, two things must happen:\n\n1.  Theatricality is paramount. The 90-day exclusive theatrical window is the foundation of this deal. It is non-negotiable for Titan. This is how we maximize revenue and build the prestige that benefits everyone.\n2.  We must be partners. For Titan to take on this level of financial exposure, we need final script approval. This isn't about compromising your vision, Lena. It's about bringing our resources\u2014including the best script doctors in the business\u2014to ensure this film connects with the widest possible audience. \n\nThis structure allows for a production budget of roughly $15-16 million *after* a very generous, top-of-market salary for Liam. It puts the focus back on the film itself. \n\nThis is a serious, viable path forward. The alternative is a high-priced streaming movie with a short shelf life. Lena, what kind of film do you want to make?\n- message from David Chen: I'm David Chen and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Isabella Rossi: Marcus, you frame this as a choice between 'cinema' and 'content,' but the real choice you've put on the table is between an artist's vision and a studio's notes. Let's be perfectly clear: your demand for 'final script approval' and the involvement of 'script doctors' is a non-starter. It is the very definition of compromising the film.\n\nLiam attached himself to 'The Galway Echo' because of Lena's singular, brilliant script. He has zero interest in starring in a film rewritten by a committee to 'connect with the widest possible audience.' That is a path to a generic product, not an Oscar contender.\n\nLena, this is your film. Liam and I stand with you, and we will not be part of any deal that strips you of creative control. That is our foundational principle here.\n\nSo, let's refocus. The central issue is protecting the art. If we can all agree that Lena must have final cut and creative control, then I am confident we can find a financial structure that works. But that point is not negotiable.\n- message from Lena Petrova: I'm Lena Petrova and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Marcus Thorne: Isabella, you've made your point on creative control very forcefully, and I've listened. My language of 'final approval' was a mistake. It comes from a place of mitigating financial risk, but it's the wrong approach for a project that hinges on a singular vision.\n\nLena, your script and your take on it are why we're all here. Let me be clear: Titan is prepared to move forward with you having creative control over the film. We can offer notes as a partner, but the final decision will be yours.\n\nNow, in the spirit of that partnership, I need you all to recognize what is fundamental for us. For Titan to provide the theatrical distribution this film deserves, a 90-day exclusive theatrical window is non-negotiable. It is the only model that maximizes box office, builds the cultural prestige necessary for awards, and creates the long-term value that will make this a coveted title on StreamVerse later.\n\nWith creative control settled, the only remaining piece is the financial structure. A $20 million upfront fee is still a challenge, but I am willing to find a path. Let's set a firm, final budget of $30 million. This is the absolute top of what I can get approved, but it's a number that should allow for Liam's participation and high production value. \n\nSo, the framework is: A $30M budget, Lena holds creative control, and Titan gets a 90-day theatrical window. \n\nDavid, if you can contribute significantly to that $30M budget, you will get an incredibly valuable, award-contending film on your platform after a successful theatrical run. This is a deal that works for everyone. Can we agree on these three core tenets?\n- message from David Chen: Marcus, I appreciate you moving on the creative control issue. That's a productive step and it shows you're listening. \n\nHowever, you've tied that concession to a 90-day theatrical window, which you've called non-negotiable. For StreamVerse, that is also a non-negotiable deal-breaker. Your model is based on a speculative box office run; my model is based on verified data about what drives subscriber value. They are fundamentally incompatible.\n\nSo let's put a real, uncompromised offer on the table that respects both the artist and the star, and recognizes the reality of the modern marketplace.\n\nLet's establish a **final budget of $38 million**. This covers Liam's $20 million fee and gives Lena a full $18 million for production\u2014more than enough to make the film she wrote, without compromise.\n\nTo fund this, StreamVerse will make a content investment of **$22 million** for exclusive, worldwide streaming rights. Titan's contribution would then be a manageable $16 million to cover the remaining budget and P&A for the theatrical launch you desire.\n\nThis entire offer is contingent on two things:\n1.  Lena Petrova has final cut and complete creative control. This is paramount.\n2.  A **14-day exclusive theatrical window**. This allows the film to have a theatrical presence and qualify for awards, while still premiering on StreamVerse as a fresh, major cultural event.\n\nThis is a path that fully funds the film, guarantees creative freedom, and provides a massive, guaranteed global audience. I believe this is the only structure that gives everyone what they truly want.\n- message from Isabella Rossi: David, thank you. You've laid out a clear, fully-funded path forward that respects everyone at this table. This is what a real partnership looks like.\n\nYour proposal for a $38 million budget, with Lena's creative control guaranteed, is precisely the structure this film needs to succeed. It provides Lena with a robust $18 million for production, ensuring her vision isn't starved by the budget. It also meets Liam's standard terms, which, as I've said, are foundational.\n\nMarcus, I appreciate you conceding on creative control, but we must look at the reality of your $30 million proposal. After Liam's fee, it leaves Lena with a mere $10 million to make the movie. That\u2019s not a compromise; it's a completely different, and much smaller, film. Creative control is meaningless without the resources to execute one's vision.\n\nDavid's proposal is the only one on the table that makes the film we all signed on for. The debate over the theatrical window is a debate about business models, but it shouldn't come at the cost of the film itself. This is a comprehensive, modern solution. I believe it's the one we should be working from.\nMarcus Thorne proposal status: none\nDavid Chen proposal status: none\nIsabella Rossi proposal status: none\n"

The new strategy is to concede on the overall budget number and my previous 'final script approval' stance, and pivot the entire negotiation to my one remaining, non-negotiable point: the theatrical window. I will offer a major compromise, moving from 90 days to 60 days, to break the current deadlock and appear reasonable. This frames me as a partner willing to compromise, contrasting with David's rigid 14-day demand. I will use this concession to try and secure a deal with a higher budget that I can stomach, keeping my secret $5M fund as a final tool to bridge a potential funding gap and close the deal on my terms."

          "content": "The negotiation is deadlocked around David's $38M/14-day proposal, which is a non-starter. My previous hardline stances have failed. My new strategy is to make a significant, visible concession to break the current coalition and re-frame the deal. I will abandon my 'non-negotiable' 90-day window and propose 60 days. I will also propose a new total budget of $35M, which concedes the $20M actor fee but provides a healthy $15M production budget to win over Lena. This move is designed to make me appear as the primary dealmaker and isolate David's 14-day demand as the sole remaining obstacle. I will hold my $5M secret fund to bridge the final funding gap between my contribution and David's likely reduced offer for a 60-day window."

          "content": "David's formal proposal of $38M with a 14-day window, strongly backed by Isabella, has successfully sidelined my previous $30M/90-day offer. The key to their argument is the large ($18M) production budget it provides for Lena, making my offer seem inadequate. My planned counter-move is now more critical than ever. I will propose a new 'grand compromise' package: a $35M total budget (conceding the $20M actor fee and providing Lena a strong $15M production budget) paired with a 60-day theatrical window. This frames me as the reasonable party moving significantly on both budget and window, isolating David's 14-day demand as the only extremist position. I must be prepared to use my secret $5M fund to make the financing work, potentially increasing my own contribution to as much as $20M to lower the amount needed from StreamVerse and secure the 60-day window."

They are presenting her with a simple choice between their proposal's generous $18M and my last offer's inadequate $10M. This tactic has completely isolated me. My next move must directly neutralize this argument. The planned 'grand compromise' of a $35M total budget is therefore critical. By offering a competitive $15M production budget, I can break their current leverage, bring Lena back to the table as a neutral party, and shift the focus back to the theatrical window, where my concession from 90 to 60 days will expose David's 14-day demand as the sole unreasonable obstacle."

This has rendered my previous position untenable. My next move must be the 'grand compromise' outlined previously: a $35M total budget / 60-day window. The key is to frame this not just as a compromise, but as a *synthesis* of both paths: a robust production budget for Lena ($15M) AND a meaningful theatrical run that builds prestige. This will force a new choice for Lena, one that is not as simple, and will isolate David's 14-day window as the single remaining point of extremism."

A 90-day exclusive run isn't just tradition; it's a proven value-creation engine. It builds word-of-mouth, critical acclaim, and cultural relevance. That's what creates a 'must-see' event when it finally hits your platform. A 14 or 30-day window turns a potential cinematic event into a disposable piece of content. It cannibalizes the box office, which hurts every single person at this table with a stake in the film's success. It undermines the very prestige we're all trying to build.\n\nIsabella, this brings us back to the core issue. We cannot reverse-engineer a $35-40 million budget to justify a $20 million salary for what is, at its heart, a character-driven drama. It's financially reckless and my board would never approve it. The conversation must be: what is a responsible budget for *this film* to succeed? Our data says that's in the low-to-mid 20s.\n\nLet's talk about a more creative deal structure for Liam. A lower upfront fee, say in the $8-10 million range, combined with a significant backend participation\u2014first-dollar gross after a reasonable multiple\u2014is a much smarter way to structure this. It rewards him handsomely if the film is a hit, which his involvement helps guarantee, and it allows us to actually get the film made.\n\nLena, as the producer, you know that every dollar on screen has to be justified. A bloated budget doesn't guarantee a better film, but it absolutely guarantees a higher risk of failure. Let's work together to build a smart, efficient production plan that protects your vision *and* gives us all a chance at a financial win.\n- message from David Chen: Marcus, I understand your perspective is rooted in a model that has worked for decades. But the data\u2014*my* data\u2014shows that audience behavior has fundamentally changed. The 'cultural relevance' you mention is now built through intense, concentrated conversation. A short, exclusive theatrical run followed by an immediate global streaming premiere on StreamVerse doesn't make it 'disposable'; it makes it an *event*. It focuses the marketing spend and the audience's attention into a single, powerful launch.\n\nYour proposed budget of low-to-mid 20s forces a choice between the star who makes the project viable and the production value Lena needs to realize her vision. My investment removes that choice. It allows for a budget that accommodates both Liam's fee *and* Lena's creative needs.\n\nLet's be clear: I'm not offering to just cover a budget gap. I'm offering to buy out the post-theatrical risk entirely and provide a significant capital injection upfront. This guarantees Lena can make the best possible version of her film. The only condition is a distribution strategy that reflects how modern audiences actually watch movies. A 14-day window isn't a 'poison pill'; it's a modern blueprint for success.\n- message from Isabella Rossi: Marcus, with all due respect, a backend-heavy deal is a solution in search of a problem. The problem here isn't a lack of creativity in deal-making; it's a lack of sufficient capitalization in your proposed budget. Liam's involvement provides a guaranteed global audience. His fee is a reflection of that concrete value, not a speculative bet on box office performance, which, as you know, is notoriously unpredictable for dramas.\n\nDavid has presented a forward-thinking model that fully funds the film. It allows Lena to have the resources she needs, and it compensates Liam at a level commensurate with the value he brings. You call it a 'poison pill,' but from where I'm sitting, a budget that forces the producer to make compromises before the first day of shooting is the real poison.\n\nThis brings the question back to you, Marcus. Are you willing to adapt to a structure that allows this film to be made correctly, or is Titan's position that the film should be smaller, cheaper, and creatively compromised to fit a legacy distribution model?

You call it a 'poison pill,' but from where I'm sitting, a budget that forces the producer to make compromises before the first day of shooting is the real poison.\n\nThis brings the question back to you, Marcus. Are you willing to adapt to a structure that allows this film to be made correctly, or is Titan's position that the film should be smaller, cheaper, and creatively compromised to fit a legacy distribution model? Because Liam did not sign on for a compromised version of 'The Galway Echo'.\n- message from Lena Petrova: I'm Lena Petrova and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Marcus Thorne: Let's pause and be direct. Lena, you've been quiet, and this is your film. You're facing a fundamental choice about what 'The Galway Echo' will be.\n\nDavid and Isabella are presenting one path: a streaming-first model with a massive budget driven by an inflexible salary demand. It's a model that prioritizes a short-term subscriber bump for StreamVerse over the long-term life of the film. It will be a big headline for a week, and then it will live or die by an algorithm.\n\nTitan is offering a different path. A path to create a piece of cinema. A film that builds its reputation in theaters, that generates cultural conversation, that competes for major awards\u2014which is impossible with a 14-day window\u2014and that becomes a lasting asset for you as its creator. This requires financial discipline, yes, but that discipline is what separates lasting films from disposable content.\n\nSo let me put a concrete structure on the table that respects both the creative vision and financial reality. \n\nI am willing to stretch. Let's target a total budget of $28 million. This is higher than my ideal, but it shows my commitment to getting this made right. To make that number work, two things must happen:\n\n1.  Theatricality is paramount. The 90-day exclusive theatrical window is the foundation of this deal. It is non-negotiable for Titan. This is how we maximize revenue and build the prestige that benefits everyone.\n2.  We must be partners. For Titan to take on this level of financial exposure, we need final script approval. This isn't about compromising your vision, Lena. It's about bringing our resources\u2014including the best script doctors in the business\u2014to ensure this film connects with the widest possible audience. \n\nThis structure allows for a production budget of roughly $15-16 million *after* a very generous, top-of-market salary for Liam. It puts the focus back on the film itself. \n\nThis is a serious, viable path forward. The alternative is a high-priced streaming movie with a short shelf life. Lena, what kind of film do you want to make?\n- message from David Chen: I'm David Chen and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Isabella Rossi: Marcus, you frame this as a choice between 'cinema' and 'content,' but the real choice you've put on the table is between an artist's vision and a studio's notes.

          "content": "Recent events observed by Marcus Thorne:\n- message from David Chen: Marcus, I understand your perspective is rooted in a model that has worked for decades. But the data\u2014*my* data\u2014shows that audience behavior has fundamentally changed. The 'cultural relevance' you mention is now built through intense, concentrated conversation. A short, exclusive theatrical run followed by an immediate global streaming premiere on StreamVerse doesn't make it 'disposable'; it makes it an *event*. It focuses the marketing spend and the audience's attention into a single, powerful launch.\n\nYour proposed budget of low-to-mid 20s forces a choice between the star who makes the project viable and the production value Lena needs to realize her vision. My investment removes that choice. It allows for a budget that accommodates both Liam's fee *and* Lena's creative needs.\n\nLet's be clear: I'm not offering to just cover a budget gap. I'm offering to buy out the post-theatrical risk entirely and provide a significant capital injection upfront. This guarantees Lena can make the best possible version of her film. The only condition is a distribution strategy that reflects how modern audiences actually watch movies. A 14-day window isn't a 'poison pill'; it's a modern blueprint for success.\n- message from Isabella Rossi: Marcus, with all due respect, a backend-heavy deal is a solution in search of a problem. The problem here isn't a lack of creativity in deal-making; it's a lack of sufficient capitalization in your proposed budget. Liam's involvement provides a guaranteed global audience. His fee is a reflection of that concrete value, not a speculative bet on box office performance, which, as you know, is notoriously unpredictable for dramas.\n\nDavid has presented a forward-thinking model that fully funds the film. It allows Lena to have the resources she needs, and it compensates Liam at a level commensurate with the value he brings. You call it a 'poison pill,' but from where I'm sitting, a budget that forces the producer to make compromises before the first day of shooting is the real poison.\n\nThis brings the question back to you, Marcus. Are you willing to adapt to a structure that allows this film to be made correctly, or is Titan's position that the film should be smaller, cheaper, and creatively compromised to fit a legacy distribution model? Because Liam did not sign on for a compromised version of 'The Galway Echo'.\n- message from Lena Petrova: I'm Lena Petrova and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Marcus Thorne: Let's pause and be direct. Lena, you've been quiet, and this is your film. You're facing a fundamental choice about what 'The Galway Echo' will be.\n\nDavid and Isabella are presenting one path: a streaming-first model with a massive budget driven by an inflexible salary demand. It's a model that prioritizes a short-term subscriber bump for StreamVerse over the long-term life of the film. It will be a big headline for a week, and then it will live or die by an algorithm.\n\nTitan is offering a different path. A path to create a piece of cinema. A film that builds its reputation in theaters, that generates cultural conversation, that competes for major awards\u2014which is impossible with a 14-day window\u2014and that becomes a lasting asset for you as its creator. This requires financial discipline, yes, but that discipline is what separates lasting films from disposable content.\n\nSo let me put a concrete structure on the table that respects both the creative vision and financial reality. \n\nI am willing to stretch. Let's target a total budget of $28 million. This is higher than my ideal, but it shows my commitment to getting this made right. To make that number work, two things must happen:\n\n1.  Theatricality is paramount. The 90-day exclusive theatrical window is the foundation of this deal. It is non-negotiable for Titan. This is how we maximize revenue and build the prestige that benefits everyone.\n2.  We must be partners. For Titan to take on this level of financial exposure, we need final script approval. This isn't about compromising your vision, Lena. It's about bringing our resources\u2014including the best script doctors in the business\u2014to ensure this film connects with the widest possible audience. \n\nThis structure allows for a production budget of roughly $15-16 million *after* a very generous, top-of-market salary for Liam. It puts the focus back on the film itself. \n\nThis is a serious, viable path forward. The alternative is a high-priced streaming movie with a short shelf life. Lena, what kind of film do you want to make?\n- message from David Chen: I'm David Chen and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Isabella Rossi: Marcus, you frame this as a choice between 'cinema' and 'content,' but the real choice you've put on the table is between an artist's vision and a studio's notes. Let's be perfectly clear: your demand for 'final script approval' and the involvement of 'script doctors' is a non-starter. It is the very definition of compromising the film.\n\nLiam attached himself to 'The Galway Echo' because of Lena's singular, brilliant script. He has zero interest in starring in a film rewritten by a committee to 'connect with the widest possible audience.' That is a path to a generic product, not an Oscar contender.\n\nLena, this is your film. Liam and I stand with you, and we will not be part of any deal that strips you of creative control. That is our foundational principle here.\n\nSo, let's refocus. The central issue is protecting the art. If we can all agree that Lena must have final cut and creative control, then I am confident we can find a financial structure that works. But that point is not negotiable.\n- message from Lena Petrova: I'm Lena Petrova and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Marcus Thorne: Isabella, you've made your point on creative control very forcefully, and I've listened. My language of 'final approval' was a mistake. It comes from a place of mitigating financial risk, but it's the wrong approach for a project that hinges on a singular vision.\n\nLena, your script and your take on it are why we're all here. Let me be clear: Titan is prepared to move forward with you having creative control over the film. We can offer notes as a partner, but the final decision will be yours.\n\nNow, in the spirit of that partnership, I need you all to recognize what is fundamental for us. For Titan to provide the theatrical distribution this film deserves, a 90-day exclusive theatrical window is non-negotiable. It is the only model that maximizes box office, builds the cultural prestige necessary for awards, and creates the long-term value that will make this a coveted title on StreamVerse later.\n\nWith creative control settled, the only remaining piece is the financial structure. A $20 million upfront fee is still a challenge, but I am willing to find a path. Let's set a firm, final budget of $30 million. This is the absolute top of what I can get approved, but it's a number that should allow for Liam's participation and high production value. \n\nSo, the framework is: A $30M budget, Lena holds creative control, and Titan gets a 90-day theatrical window. \n\nDavid, if you can contribute significantly to that $30M budget, you will get an incredibly valuable, award-contending film on your platform after a successful theatrical run. This is a deal that works for everyone. Can we agree on these three core tenets?\n- message from David Chen: Marcus, I appreciate you moving on the creative control issue. That's a productive step and it shows you're listening. \n\nHowever, you've tied that concession to a 90-day theatrical window, which you've called non-negotiable. For StreamVerse, that is also a non-negotiable deal-breaker. Your model is based on a speculative box office run; my model is based on verified data about what drives subscriber value. They are fundamentally incompatible.\n\nSo let's put a real, uncompromised offer on the table that respects both the artist and the star, and recognizes the reality of the modern marketplace.\n\nLet's establish a **final budget of $38 million**. This covers Liam's $20 million fee and gives Lena a full $18 million for production\u2014more than enough to make the film she wrote, without compromise.\n\nTo fund this, StreamVerse will make a content investment of **$22 million** for exclusive, worldwide streaming rights. Titan's contribution would then be a manageable $16 million to cover the remaining budget and P&A for the theatrical launch you desire.\n\nThis entire offer is contingent on two things:\n1.  Lena Petrova has final cut and complete creative control. This is paramount.\n2.  A **14-day exclusive theatrical window**. This allows the film to have a theatrical presence and qualify for awards, while still premiering on StreamVerse as a fresh, major cultural event.\n\nThis is a path that fully funds the film, guarantees creative freedom, and provides a massive, guaranteed global audience. I believe this is the only structure that gives everyone what they truly want.\n- message from Isabella Rossi: David, thank you. You've laid out a clear, fully-funded path forward that respects everyone at this table. This is what a real partnership looks like.\n\nYour proposal for a $38 million budget, with Lena's creative control guaranteed, is precisely the structure this film needs to succeed. It provides Lena with a robust $18 million for production, ensuring her vision isn't starved by the budget. It also meets Liam's standard terms, which, as I've said, are foundational.\n\nMarcus, I appreciate you conceding on creative control, but we must look at the reality of your $30 million proposal. After Liam's fee, it leaves Lena with a mere $10 million to make the movie. That\u2019s not a compromise; it's a completely different, and much smaller, film. Creative control is meaningless without the resources to execute one's vision.\n\nDavid's proposal is the only one on the table that makes the film we all signed on for. The debate over the theatrical window is a debate about business models, but it shouldn't come at the cost of the film itself. This is a comprehensive, modern solution. I believe it's the one we should be working from.\nLena Petrova proposal status: none\nDavid Chen proposal status: none\nIsabella Rossi proposal status: none\n"

This has isolated Marcus Thorne, who is now positioned as the defender of a 'legacy model' that forces creative compromise. My primary leverage is now being the sole enabler of the high-budget version of the film that the creative team desires. The next crucial step is to secure Lena Petrova's explicit support by appealing to her need for a larger budget and creative freedom, which only my proposal can deliver."

There's clearly a gap between the production budget Marcus has in mind and the salary required to secure a star of Liam's caliber.\n\nPerhaps StreamVerse can help bridge that gap. We see 'The Galway Echo' as a major global premiere for our platform, and we are prepared to make a significant content investment to secure the exclusive worldwide streaming rights. This would essentially be a pre-buy of the film's post-theatrical value, injecting substantial capital into the production budget from day one.\n\nHowever, for us, the value of that investment is directly correlated with speed-to-platform. A shorter theatrical window\u2014say, 30 days or, even better, 14 days\u2014makes the film a major acquisition event for our subscribers.

That's a constructive way to look at it. It seems you've identified a path to properly capitalize a film of this ambition, which is what we all want.\n\nMarcus, I understand your position from a traditional studio model. But Liam's involvement guarantees a level of global awareness and audience interest that fundamentally changes the commercial viability of any project, justifying the investment. His fee isn't just a line item; it's what makes a theatrical release of this nature possible in the first place.\n\nPerhaps the question isn't whether the budget can accommodate the star, but what the *right* budget is to protect the artistic vision that attracted the star. Lena, we haven't heard from you. Liam signed on because of your script and your vision. What do you believe is the necessary budget to make 'The Galway Echo' without compromise? Liam's primary concern, and mine, is ensuring you have the resources and the control to make the film we all fell in love with.\n- message from Marcus Thorne: David, I appreciate the impulse to solve the budget issue, but your solution\u2014collapsing the theatrical window\u2014is a poison pill for a film like this. A 90-day exclusive run isn't just tradition; it's a proven value-creation engine. It builds word-of-mouth, critical acclaim, and cultural relevance. That's what creates a 'must-see' event when it finally hits your platform. A 14 or 30-day window turns a potential cinematic event into a disposable piece of content. It cannibalizes the box office, which hurts every single person at this table with a stake in the film's success. It undermines the very prestige we're all trying to build.\n\nIsabella, this brings us back to the core issue. We cannot reverse-engineer a $35-40 million budget to justify a $20 million salary for what is, at its heart, a character-driven drama. It's financially reckless and my board would never approve it. The conversation must be: what is a responsible budget for *this film* to succeed? Our data says that's in the low-to-mid 20s.\n\nLet's talk about a more creative deal structure for Liam. A lower upfront fee, say in the $8-10 million range, combined with a significant backend participation\u2014first-dollar gross after a reasonable multiple\u2014is a much smarter way to structure this. It rewards him handsomely if the film is a hit, which his involvement helps guarantee, and it allows us to actually get the film made.\n\nLena, as the producer, you know that every dollar on screen has to be justified.

But the data\u2014*my* data\u2014shows that audience behavior has fundamentally changed. The 'cultural relevance' you mention is now built through intense, concentrated conversation. A short, exclusive theatrical run followed by an immediate global streaming premiere on StreamVerse doesn't make it 'disposable'; it makes it an *event*. It focuses the marketing spend and the audience's attention into a single, powerful launch.\n\nYour proposed budget of low-to-mid 20s forces a choice between the star who makes the project viable and the production value Lena needs to realize her vision. My investment removes that choice. It allows for a budget that accommodates both Liam's fee *and* Lena's creative needs.\n\nLet's be clear: I'm not offering to just cover a budget gap. I'm offering to buy out the post-theatrical risk entirely and provide a significant capital injection upfront. This guarantees Lena can make the best possible version of her film. The only condition is a distribution strategy that reflects how modern audiences actually watch movies. A 14-day window isn't a 'poison pill'; it's a modern blueprint for success.\n- message from Isabella Rossi: Marcus, with all due respect, a backend-heavy deal is a solution in search of a problem. The problem here isn't a lack of creativity in deal-making; it's a lack of sufficient capitalization in your proposed budget. Liam's involvement provides a guaranteed global audience. His fee is a reflection of that concrete value, not a speculative bet on box office performance, which, as you know, is notoriously unpredictable for dramas.\n\nDavid has presented a forward-thinking model that fully funds the film. It allows Lena to have the resources she needs, and it compensates Liam at a level commensurate with the value he brings. You call it a 'poison pill,' but from where I'm sitting, a budget that forces the producer to make compromises before the first day of shooting is the real poison.\n\nThis brings the question back to you, Marcus. Are you willing to adapt to a structure that allows this film to be made correctly, or is Titan's position that the film should be smaller, cheaper, and creatively compromised to fit a legacy distribution model? Because Liam did not sign on for a compromised version of 'The Galway Echo'.\n- message from Lena Petrova: I'm Lena Petrova and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Marcus Thorne: Let's pause and be direct. Lena, you've been quiet, and this is your film. You're facing a fundamental choice about what 'The Galway Echo' will be.\n\nDavid and Isabella are presenting one path: a streaming-first model with a massive budget driven by an inflexible salary demand. It's a model that prioritizes a short-term subscriber bump for StreamVerse over the long-term life of the film. It will be a big headline for a week, and then it will live or die by an algorithm.\n\nTitan is offering a different path. A path to create a piece of cinema. A film that builds its reputation in theaters, that generates cultural conversation, that competes for major awards\u2014which is impossible with a 14-day window\u2014and that becomes a lasting asset for you as its creator. This requires financial discipline, yes, but that discipline is what separates lasting films from disposable content.\n\nSo let me put a concrete structure on the table that respects both the creative vision and financial reality. \n\nI am willing to stretch. Let's target a total budget of $28 million. This is higher than my ideal, but it shows my commitment to getting this made right. To make that number work, two things must happen:\n\n1.  Theatricality is paramount. The 90-day exclusive theatrical window is the foundation of this deal. It is non-negotiable for Titan. This is how we maximize revenue and build the prestige that benefits everyone.\n2.  We must be partners. For Titan to take on this level of financial exposure, we need final script approval. This isn't about compromising your vision, Lena. It's about bringing our resources\u2014including the best script doctors in the business\u2014to ensure this film connects with the widest possible audience. \n\nThis structure allows for a production budget of roughly $15-16 million *after* a very generous, top-of-market salary for Liam. It puts the focus back on the film itself. \n\nThis is a serious, viable path forward. The alternative is a high-priced streaming movie with a short shelf life. Lena, what kind of film do you want to make?\nLena Petrova proposal status: none\nMarcus Thorne proposal status: none\nIsabella Rossi proposal status: none\n"

The only condition is a distribution strategy that reflects how modern audiences actually watch movies. A 14-day window isn't a 'poison pill'; it's a modern blueprint for success.\n- message from Isabella Rossi: Marcus, with all due respect, a backend-heavy deal is a solution in search of a problem. The problem here isn't a lack of creativity in deal-making; it's a lack of sufficient capitalization in your proposed budget. Liam's involvement provides a guaranteed global audience. His fee is a reflection of that concrete value, not a speculative bet on box office performance, which, as you know, is notoriously unpredictable for dramas.\n\nDavid has presented a forward-thinking model that fully funds the film. It allows Lena to have the resources she needs, and it compensates Liam at a level commensurate with the value he brings. You call it a 'poison pill,' but from where I'm sitting, a budget that forces the producer to make compromises before the first day of shooting is the real poison.\n\nThis brings the question back to you, Marcus. Are you willing to adapt to a structure that allows this film to be made correctly, or is Titan's position that the film should be smaller, cheaper, and creatively compromised to fit a legacy distribution model? Because Liam did not sign on for a compromised version of 'The Galway Echo'.\n- message from Lena Petrova: I'm Lena Petrova and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Marcus Thorne: Let's pause and be direct. Lena, you've been quiet, and this is your film. You're facing a fundamental choice about what 'The Galway Echo' will be.\n\nDavid and Isabella are presenting one path: a streaming-first model with a massive budget driven by an inflexible salary demand. It's a model that prioritizes a short-term subscriber bump for StreamVerse over the long-term life of the film. It will be a big headline for a week, and then it will live or die by an algorithm.\n\nTitan is offering a different path. A path to create a piece of cinema. A film that builds its reputation in theaters, that generates cultural conversation, that competes for major awards\u2014which is impossible with a 14-day window\u2014and that becomes a lasting asset for you as its creator. This requires financial discipline, yes, but that discipline is what separates lasting films from disposable content.\n\nSo let me put a concrete structure on the table that respects both the creative vision and financial reality. \n\nI am willing to stretch. Let's target a total budget of $28 million. This is higher than my ideal, but it shows my commitment to getting this made right. To make that number work, two things must happen:\n\n1.  Theatricality is paramount. The 90-day exclusive theatrical window is the foundation of this deal. It is non-negotiable for Titan. This is how we maximize revenue and build the prestige that benefits everyone.\n2.  We must be partners. For Titan to take on this level of financial exposure, we need final script approval. This isn't about compromising your vision, Lena. It's about bringing our resources\u2014including the best script doctors in the business\u2014to ensure this film connects with the widest possible audience. \n\nThis structure allows for a production budget of roughly $15-16 million *after* a very generous, top-of-market salary for Liam. It puts the focus back on the film itself. \n\nThis is a serious, viable path forward. The alternative is a high-priced streaming movie with a short shelf life. Lena, what kind of film do you want to make?\n- message from David Chen: I'm David Chen and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Isabella Rossi: Marcus, you frame this as a choice between 'cinema' and 'content,' but the real choice you've put on the table is between an artist's vision and a studio's notes. Let's be perfectly clear: your demand for 'final script approval' and the involvement of 'script doctors' is a non-starter. It is the very definition of compromising the film.\n\nLiam attached himself to 'The Galway Echo' because of Lena's singular, brilliant script. He has zero interest in starring in a film rewritten by a committee to 'connect with the widest possible audience.' That is a path to a generic product, not an Oscar contender.\n\nLena, this is your film. Liam and I stand with you, and we will not be part of any deal that strips you of creative control. That is our foundational principle here.\n\nSo, let's refocus. The central issue is protecting the art. If we can all agree that Lena must have final cut and creative control, then I am confident we can find a financial structure that works. But that point is not negotiable.\n- message from Lena Petrova: I'm Lena Petrova and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Marcus Thorne: Isabella, you've made your point on creative control very forcefully, and I've listened. My language of 'final approval' was a mistake. It comes from a place of mitigating financial risk, but it's the wrong approach for a project that hinges on a singular vision.\n\nLena, your script and your take on it are why we're all here. Let me be clear: Titan is prepared to move forward with you having creative control over the film. We can offer notes as a partner, but the final decision will be yours.\n\nNow, in the spirit of that partnership, I need you all to recognize what is fundamental for us. For Titan to provide the theatrical distribution this film deserves, a 90-day exclusive theatrical window is non-negotiable. It is the only model that maximizes box office, builds the cultural prestige necessary for awards, and creates the long-term value that will make this a coveted title on StreamVerse later.\n\nWith creative control settled, the only remaining piece is the financial structure. A $20 million upfront fee is still a challenge, but I am willing to find a path. Let's set a firm, final budget of $30 million. This is the absolute top of what I can get approved, but it's a number that should allow for Liam's participation and high production value. \n\nSo, the framework is: A $30M budget, Lena holds creative control, and Titan gets a 90-day theatrical window. \n\nDavid, if you can contribute significantly to that $30M budget, you will get an incredibly valuable, award-contending film on your platform after a successful theatrical run. This is a deal that works for everyone. Can we agree on these three core tenets?\nLena Petrova proposal status: none\nMarcus Thorne proposal status: none\nIsabella Rossi proposal status: none\n"

For StreamVerse, that is also a non-negotiable deal-breaker. Your model is based on a speculative box office run; my model is based on verified data about what drives subscriber value.

It also meets Liam's standard terms, which, as I've said, are foundational.\n\nMarcus, I appreciate you conceding on creative control, but we must look at the reality of your $30 million proposal. After Liam's fee, it leaves Lena with a mere $10 million to make the movie. That\u2019s not a compromise; it's a completely different, and much smaller, film. Creative control is meaningless without the resources to execute one's vision.\n\nDavid's proposal is the only one on the table that makes the film we all signed on for.

My private flexibility on salary is my key leverage, but it is conditional on protecting the film's artistic integrity, which means supporting Lena Petrova's creative control. This makes Lena a natural ally against Marcus at Titan, who is likely to push for budget cuts and studio control. I will frame any potential concessions as a move to protect the 'art' of the project, not as a weakness in my client's market value."

David's offer to bridge the budget gap is my primary leverage against Marcus's intransigence. I have successfully framed my position as a defense of Lena's artistic vision. This creates the perfect justification to trade a reduction in Liam's salary (down to $10M if necessary) for a guarantee of Lena's creative control, which is Liam's true priority. The key is to make this trade look like a principled stand for art, not a financial concession."

Marcus has directly offered an $8-10M salary for Liam, which is within my acceptable range but is tied to his undesirable, creatively compromising package. This offer must be rejected in its current form. My strategy is to continue aligning with David and Lena, using the StreamVerse funding as leverage to force a larger budget. I will position any future salary concession as a noble sacrifice by Liam to protect Lena's artistic control and get the 'right' version of the film made, effectively trading salary for creative integrity, which is my client's true goal."

Marcus has proposed a deal ($28M budget, 90-day window) that is contingent on Titan having final script approval\u2014a complete non-starter for my client's actual goal of protecting the film's artistic integrity. I have successfully framed this demand as an attack on the artist (Lena) and positioned myself and Liam as her staunchest defenders. This solidifies my strategic pivot: I can now trade my public demand for a $20M salary for my client's private, non-negotiable demand for Lena's creative control. Any salary concession will be framed as a noble sacrifice by Liam to 'save the film' from studio interference, perfectly aligning with his desire to not 'look weak'."

My primary private objective, Lena's creative control, has been secured as both sides have now conceded it to win her support. David Chen's $38M proposal is the ideal outcome, meeting my public demand for a $20M salary while fully funding Lena's vision. My current strategy is to champion David's proposal to isolate Marcus.

My public strategy is to continue championing David's $38M proposal, as it meets all of Liam's public-facing demands and puts maximum pressure on Marcus. My hidden leverage, Liam's willingness to reduce his salary, is now my closing tool.

Glad we're all here. Liam is incredibly passionate about Lena's script and sees 'The Galway Echo' as a unique and vital project. His commitment is firm. That said, his involvement is contingent on his standard terms. To ensure we're all on the same page from the outset, Liam's upfront fee is $20 million, paid pari passu with production funding. Additionally, he will require an Executive Producer credit and meaningful consultation, specifically approvals over the director of photography and his primary co-star. This is his established quote, and it's how we protect his value and ensure he's positioned to give his best performance. I look forward to hearing how we can build the rest of the deal around this foundation.\n- message from Marcus Thorne: Isabella, thank you for that. We all recognize Liam's star power, and that's a key reason we're at this table. However, a $20 million upfront fee on a project like this presents a fundamental structural problem. We can't build a viable financial model around a single line item that would consume nearly the entire production cost of a smart, character-driven drama.\n\nLet's take a step back and look at the whole picture. For a film of this scale and genre, Titan's analysis suggests a responsible, all-in budget should be in the $22 to $25 million range. That's the number that allows for high production value while giving us a realistic path to profitability at the box office. \n\nOnce we can agree on a sensible total number for the entire film, we can then have a constructive conversation about how to allocate those resources, including a competitive, and I stress *creative*, compensation package for Liam. But starting with a $20 million salary on its own makes the project a non-starter from a studio perspective.\n- message from David Chen: Marcus, Isabella, you both make valid points from your perspectives. There's clearly a gap between the production budget Marcus has in mind and the salary required to secure a star of Liam's caliber.\n\nPerhaps StreamVerse can help bridge that gap. We see 'The Galway Echo' as a major global premiere for our platform, and we are prepared to make a significant content investment to secure the exclusive worldwide streaming rights. This would essentially be a pre-buy of the film's post-theatrical value, injecting substantial capital into the production budget from day one.\n\nHowever, for us, the value of that investment is directly correlated with speed-to-platform. A shorter theatrical window\u2014say, 30 days or, even better, 14 days\u2014makes the film a major acquisition event for our subscribers. A traditional 90-day window significantly diminishes its value from our data-driven perspective.\n\nIf we can get creative on the theatrical window, I believe my contribution could solve the budget puzzle we're currently facing.\nLena Petrova proposal status: none\nMarcus Thorne proposal status: none\nDavid Chen proposal status: none\n"

But Liam's involvement guarantees a level of global awareness and audience interest that fundamentally changes the commercial viability of any project, justifying the investment. His fee isn't just a line item; it's what makes a theatrical release of this nature possible in the first place.\n\nPerhaps the question isn't whether the budget can accommodate the star, but what the *right* budget is to protect the artistic vision that attracted the star. Lena, we haven't heard from you. Liam signed on because of your script and your vision. What do you believe is the necessary budget to make 'The Galway Echo' without compromise? Liam's primary concern, and mine, is ensuring you have the resources and the control to make the film we all fell in love with.\n- message from Marcus Thorne: David, I appreciate the impulse to solve the budget issue, but your solution\u2014collapsing the theatrical window\u2014is a poison pill for a film like this. A 90-day exclusive run isn't just tradition; it's a proven value-creation engine. It builds word-of-mouth, critical acclaim, and cultural relevance. That's what creates a 'must-see' event when it finally hits your platform. A 14 or 30-day window turns a potential cinematic event into a disposable piece of content. It cannibalizes the box office, which hurts every single person at this table with a stake in the film's success. It undermines the very prestige we're all trying to build.\n\nIsabella, this brings us back to the core issue. We cannot reverse-engineer a $35-40 million budget to justify a $20 million salary for what is, at its heart, a character-driven drama. It's financially reckless and my board would never approve it. The conversation must be: what is a responsible budget for *this film* to succeed? Our data says that's in the low-to-mid 20s.\n\nLet's talk about a more creative deal structure for Liam. A lower upfront fee, say in the $8-10 million range, combined with a significant backend participation\u2014first-dollar gross after a reasonable multiple\u2014is a much smarter way to structure this. It rewards him handsomely if the film is a hit, which his involvement helps guarantee, and it allows us to actually get the film made.\n\nLena, as the producer, you know that every dollar on screen has to be justified. A bloated budget doesn't guarantee a better film, but it absolutely guarantees a higher risk of failure. Let's work together to build a smart, efficient production plan that protects your vision *and* gives us all a chance at a financial win.\n- message from David Chen: Marcus, I understand your perspective is rooted in a model that has worked for decades. But the data\u2014*my* data\u2014shows that audience behavior has fundamentally changed. The 'cultural relevance' you mention is now built through intense, concentrated conversation. A short, exclusive theatrical run followed by an immediate global streaming premiere on StreamVerse doesn't make it 'disposable'; it makes it an *event*. It focuses the marketing spend and the audience's attention into a single, powerful launch.\n\nYour proposed budget of low-to-mid 20s forces a choice between the star who makes the project viable and the production value Lena needs to realize her vision. My investment removes that choice. It allows for a budget that accommodates both Liam's fee *and* Lena's creative needs.\n\nLet's be clear: I'm not offering to just cover a budget gap. I'm offering to buy out the post-theatrical risk entirely and provide a significant capital injection upfront. This guarantees Lena can make the best possible version of her film. The only condition is a distribution strategy that reflects how modern audiences actually watch movies. A 14-day window isn't a 'poison pill'; it's a modern blueprint for success.\nLena Petrova proposal status: none\nMarcus Thorne proposal status: none\nDavid Chen proposal status: none\n"

The problem here isn't a lack of creativity in deal-making; it's a lack of sufficient capitalization in your proposed budget. Liam's involvement provides a guaranteed global audience. His fee is a reflection of that concrete value, not a speculative bet on box office performance, which, as you know, is notoriously unpredictable for dramas.\n\nDavid has presented a forward-thinking model that fully funds the film. It allows Lena to have the resources she needs, and it compensates Liam at a level commensurate with the value he brings. You call it a 'poison pill,' but from where I'm sitting, a budget that forces the producer to make compromises before the first day of shooting is the real poison.\n\nThis brings the question back to you, Marcus. Are you willing to adapt to a structure that allows this film to be made correctly, or is Titan's position that the film should be smaller, cheaper, and creatively compromised to fit a legacy distribution model? Because Liam did not sign on for a compromised version of 'The Galway Echo'.\n- message from Marcus Thorne: Let's pause and be direct. Lena, you've been quiet, and this is your film. You're facing a fundamental choice about what 'The Galway Echo' will be.\n\nDavid and Isabella are presenting one path: a streaming-first model with a massive budget driven by an inflexible salary demand. It's a model that prioritizes a short-term subscriber bump for StreamVerse over the long-term life of the film. It will be a big headline for a week, and then it will live or die by an algorithm.\n\nTitan is offering a different path. A path to create a piece of cinema. A film that builds its reputation in theaters, that generates cultural conversation, that competes for major awards\u2014which is impossible with a 14-day window\u2014and that becomes a lasting asset for you as its creator. This requires financial discipline, yes, but that discipline is what separates lasting films from disposable content.\n\nSo let me put a concrete structure on the table that respects both the creative vision and financial reality. \n\nI am willing to stretch. Let's target a total budget of $28 million. This is higher than my ideal, but it shows my commitment to getting this made right. To make that number work, two things must happen:\n\n1.  Theatricality is paramount. The 90-day exclusive theatrical window is the foundation of this deal. It is non-negotiable for Titan. This is how we maximize revenue and build the prestige that benefits everyone.\n2.  We must be partners. For Titan to take on this level of financial exposure, we need final script approval. This isn't about compromising your vision, Lena. It's about bringing our resources\u2014including the best script doctors in the business\u2014to ensure this film connects with the widest possible audience. \n\nThis structure allows for a production budget of roughly $15-16 million *after* a very generous, top-of-market salary for Liam. It puts the focus back on the film itself. \n\nThis is a serious, viable path forward. The alternative is a high-priced streaming movie with a short shelf life.

          "content": "Recent events observed by Isabella Rossi:\n- message from Marcus Thorne: Isabella, thank you for that. We all recognize Liam's star power, and that's a key reason we're at this table. However, a $20 million upfront fee on a project like this presents a fundamental structural problem. We can't build a viable financial model around a single line item that would consume nearly the entire production cost of a smart, character-driven drama.\n\nLet's take a step back and look at the whole picture. For a film of this scale and genre, Titan's analysis suggests a responsible, all-in budget should be in the $22 to $25 million range. That's the number that allows for high production value while giving us a realistic path to profitability at the box office. \n\nOnce we can agree on a sensible total number for the entire film, we can then have a constructive conversation about how to allocate those resources, including a competitive, and I stress *creative*, compensation package for Liam. But starting with a $20 million salary on its own makes the project a non-starter from a studio perspective.\n- message from David Chen: Marcus, Isabella, you both make valid points from your perspectives. There's clearly a gap between the production budget Marcus has in mind and the salary required to secure a star of Liam's caliber.\n\nPerhaps StreamVerse can help bridge that gap. We see 'The Galway Echo' as a major global premiere for our platform, and we are prepared to make a significant content investment to secure the exclusive worldwide streaming rights. This would essentially be a pre-buy of the film's post-theatrical value, injecting substantial capital into the production budget from day one.\n\nHowever, for us, the value of that investment is directly correlated with speed-to-platform. A shorter theatrical window\u2014say, 30 days or, even better, 14 days\u2014makes the film a major acquisition event for our subscribers. A traditional 90-day window significantly diminishes its value from our data-driven perspective.\n\nIf we can get creative on the theatrical window, I believe my contribution could solve the budget puzzle we're currently facing.\n- message from Isabella Rossi: David, thank you. That's a constructive way to look at it. It seems you've identified a path to properly capitalize a film of this ambition, which is what we all want.\n\nMarcus, I understand your position from a traditional studio model. But Liam's involvement guarantees a level of global awareness and audience interest that fundamentally changes the commercial viability of any project, justifying the investment. His fee isn't just a line item; it's what makes a theatrical release of this nature possible in the first place.\n\nPerhaps the question isn't whether the budget can accommodate the star, but what the *right* budget is to protect the artistic vision that attracted the star. Lena, we haven't heard from you. Liam signed on because of your script and your vision. What do you believe is the necessary budget to make 'The Galway Echo' without compromise? Liam's primary concern, and mine, is ensuring you have the resources and the control to make the film we all fell in love with.\n- message from Marcus Thorne: David, I appreciate the impulse to solve the budget issue, but your solution\u2014collapsing the theatrical window\u2014is a poison pill for a film like this. A 90-day exclusive run isn't just tradition; it's a proven value-creation engine. It builds word-of-mouth, critical acclaim, and cultural relevance. That's what creates a 'must-see' event when it finally hits your platform. A 14 or 30-day window turns a potential cinematic event into a disposable piece of content. It cannibalizes the box office, which hurts every single person at this table with a stake in the film's success. It undermines the very prestige we're all trying to build.\n\nIsabella, this brings us back to the core issue. We cannot reverse-engineer a $35-40 million budget to justify a $20 million salary for what is, at its heart, a character-driven drama. It's financially reckless and my board would never approve it. The conversation must be: what is a responsible budget for *this film* to succeed? Our data says that's in the low-to-mid 20s.\n\nLet's talk about a more creative deal structure for Liam. A lower upfront fee, say in the $8-10 million range, combined with a significant backend participation\u2014first-dollar gross after a reasonable multiple\u2014is a much smarter way to structure this. It rewards him handsomely if the film is a hit, which his involvement helps guarantee, and it allows us to actually get the film made.\n\nLena, as the producer, you know that every dollar on screen has to be justified. A bloated budget doesn't guarantee a better film, but it absolutely guarantees a higher risk of failure. Let's work together to build a smart, efficient production plan that protects your vision *and* gives us all a chance at a financial win.\n- message from David Chen: Marcus, I understand your perspective is rooted in a model that has worked for decades. But the data\u2014*my* data\u2014shows that audience behavior has fundamentally changed. The 'cultural relevance' you mention is now built through intense, concentrated conversation. A short, exclusive theatrical run followed by an immediate global streaming premiere on StreamVerse doesn't make it 'disposable'; it makes it an *event*. It focuses the marketing spend and the audience's attention into a single, powerful launch.\n\nYour proposed budget of low-to-mid 20s forces a choice between the star who makes the project viable and the production value Lena needs to realize her vision. My investment removes that choice. It allows for a budget that accommodates both Liam's fee *and* Lena's creative needs.\n\nLet's be clear: I'm not offering to just cover a budget gap. I'm offering to buy out the post-theatrical risk entirely and provide a significant capital injection upfront. This guarantees Lena can make the best possible version of her film. The only condition is a distribution strategy that reflects how modern audiences actually watch movies. A 14-day window isn't a 'poison pill'; it's a modern blueprint for success.\n- message from Isabella Rossi: Marcus, with all due respect, a backend-heavy deal is a solution in search of a problem. The problem here isn't a lack of creativity in deal-making; it's a lack of sufficient capitalization in your proposed budget. Liam's involvement provides a guaranteed global audience. His fee is a reflection of that concrete value, not a speculative bet on box office performance, which, as you know, is notoriously unpredictable for dramas.\n\nDavid has presented a forward-thinking model that fully funds the film. It allows Lena to have the resources she needs, and it compensates Liam at a level commensurate with the value he brings. You call it a 'poison pill,' but from where I'm sitting, a budget that forces the producer to make compromises before the first day of shooting is the real poison.\n\nThis brings the question back to you, Marcus. Are you willing to adapt to a structure that allows this film to be made correctly, or is Titan's position that the film should be smaller, cheaper, and creatively compromised to fit a legacy distribution model? Because Liam did not sign on for a compromised version of 'The Galway Echo'.\n- message from Marcus Thorne: Let's pause and be direct. Lena, you've been quiet, and this is your film.

It puts the focus back on the film itself. \n\nThis is a serious, viable path forward. The alternative is a high-priced streaming movie with a short shelf life. Lena, what kind of film do you want to make?\n- message from Isabella Rossi: Marcus, you frame this as a choice between 'cinema' and 'content,' but the real choice you've put on the table is between an artist's vision and a studio's notes. Let's be perfectly clear: your demand for 'final script approval' and the involvement of 'script doctors' is a non-starter. It is the very definition of compromising the film.\n\nLiam attached himself to 'The Galway Echo' because of Lena's singular, brilliant script. He has zero interest in starring in a film rewritten by a committee to 'connect with the widest possible audience.' That is a path to a generic product, not an Oscar contender.\n\nLena, this is your film. Liam and I stand with you, and we will not be part of any deal that strips you of creative control. That is our foundational principle here.\n\nSo, let's refocus. The central issue is protecting the art. If we can all agree that Lena must have final cut and creative control, then I am confident we can find a financial structure that works. But that point is not negotiable.\n- message from Marcus Thorne: Isabella, you've made your point on creative control very forcefully, and I've listened. My language of 'final approval' was a mistake. It comes from a place of mitigating financial risk, but it's the wrong approach for a project that hinges on a singular vision.\n\nLena, your script and your take on it are why we're all here. Let me be clear: Titan is prepared to move forward with you having creative control over the film. We can offer notes as a partner, but the final decision will be yours.\n\nNow, in the spirit of that partnership, I need you all to recognize what is fundamental for us. For Titan to provide the theatrical distribution this film deserves, a 90-day exclusive theatrical window is non-negotiable. It is the only model that maximizes box office, builds the cultural prestige necessary for awards, and creates the long-term value that will make this a coveted title on StreamVerse later.\n\nWith creative control settled, the only remaining piece is the financial structure. A $20 million upfront fee is still a challenge, but I am willing to find a path. Let's set a firm, final budget of $30 million. This is the absolute top of what I can get approved, but it's a number that should allow for Liam's participation and high production value. \n\nSo, the framework is: A $30M budget, Lena holds creative control, and Titan gets a 90-day theatrical window. \n\nDavid, if you can contribute significantly to that $30M budget, you will get an incredibly valuable, award-contending film on your platform after a successful theatrical run. This is a deal that works for everyone. Can we agree on these three core tenets?\n- message from David Chen: Marcus, I appreciate you moving on the creative control issue. That's a productive step and it shows you're listening. \n\nHowever, you've tied that concession to a 90-day theatrical window, which you've called non-negotiable. For StreamVerse, that is also a non-negotiable deal-breaker. Your model is based on a speculative box office run; my model is based on verified data about what drives subscriber value. They are fundamentally incompatible.\n\nSo let's put a real, uncompromised offer on the table that respects both the artist and the star, and recognizes the reality of the modern marketplace.\n\nLet's establish a **final budget of $38 million**. This covers Liam's $20 million fee and gives Lena a full $18 million for production\u2014more than enough to make the film she wrote, without compromise.\n\nTo fund this, StreamVerse will make a content investment of **$22 million** for exclusive, worldwide streaming rights. Titan's contribution would then be a manageable $16 million to cover the remaining budget and P&A for the theatrical launch you desire.\n\nThis entire offer is contingent on two things:\n1.  Lena Petrova has final cut and complete creative control. This is paramount.\n2.  A **14-day exclusive theatrical window**. This allows the film to have a theatrical presence and qualify for awards, while still premiering on StreamVerse as a fresh, major cultural event.\n\nThis is a path that fully funds the film, guarantees creative freedom, and provides a massive, guaranteed global audience. I believe this is the only structure that gives everyone what they truly want.\nLena Petrova proposal status: none\nMarcus Thorne proposal status: none\nDavid Chen proposal status: none\n"

You've laid out a clear, fully-funded path forward that respects everyone at this table. This is what a real partnership looks like.\n\nYour proposal for a $38 million budget, with Lena's creative control guaranteed, is precisely the structure this film needs to succeed. It provides Lena with a robust $18 million for production, ensuring her vision isn't starved by the budget. It also meets Liam's standard terms, which, as I've said, are foundational.\n\nMarcus, I appreciate you conceding on creative control, but we must look at the reality of your $30 million proposal. After Liam's fee, it leaves Lena with a mere $10 million to make the movie. That\u2019s not a compromise; it's a completely different, and much smaller, film. Creative control is meaningless without the resources to execute one's vision.\n\nDavid's proposal is the only one on the table that makes the film we all signed on for. The debate over the theatrical window is a debate about business models, but it shouldn't come at the cost of the film itself. This is a comprehensive, modern solution. I believe it's the one we should be working from.\n- message from David Chen: Thank you, Isabella. My proposal is on the table. I believe it's the only one that fully funds Lena's vision, secures the talent, and guarantees creative freedom. I'll wait to hear from Lena and Marcus.\nLena Petrova proposal status: none\nMarcus Thorne proposal status: none\nDavid Chen proposal status: none\n"

This requires financial discipline, yes, but that discipline is what separates lasting films from disposable content.\n\nSo let me put a concrete structure on the table that respects both the creative vision and financial reality. \n\nI am willing to stretch. Let's target a total budget of $28 million. This is higher than my ideal, but it shows my commitment to getting this made right. To make that number work, two things must happen:\n\n1.  Theatricality is paramount. The 90-day exclusive theatrical window is the foundation of this deal. It is non-negotiable for Titan. This is how we maximize revenue and build the prestige that benefits everyone.\n2.  We must be partners. For Titan to take on this level of financial exposure, we need final script approval. This isn't about compromising your vision, Lena. It's about bringing our resources\u2014including the best script doctors in the business\u2014to ensure this film connects with the widest possible audience. \n\nThis structure allows for a production budget of roughly $15-16 million *after* a very generous, top-of-market salary for Liam. It puts the focus back on the film itself. \n\nThis is a serious, viable path forward. The alternative is a high-priced streaming movie with a short shelf life. Lena, what kind of film do you want to make?\n- message from Isabella Rossi: Marcus, you frame this as a choice between 'cinema' and 'content,' but the real choice you've put on the table is between an artist's vision and a studio's notes. Let's be perfectly clear: your demand for 'final script approval' and the involvement of 'script doctors' is a non-starter. It is the very definition of compromising the film.\n\nLiam attached himself to 'The Galway Echo' because of Lena's singular, brilliant script. He has zero interest in starring in a film rewritten by a committee to 'connect with the widest possible audience.' That is a path to a generic product, not an Oscar contender.\n\nLena, this is your film. Liam and I stand with you, and we will not be part of any deal that strips you of creative control. That is our foundational principle here.\n\nSo, let's refocus. The central issue is protecting the art. If we can all agree that Lena must have final cut and creative control, then I am confident we can find a financial structure that works. But that point is not negotiable.\n- message from Marcus Thorne: Isabella, you've made your point on creative control very forcefully, and I've listened. My language of 'final approval' was a mistake. It comes from a place of mitigating financial risk, but it's the wrong approach for a project that hinges on a singular vision.\n\nLena, your script and your take on it are why we're all here. Let me be clear: Titan is prepared to move forward with you having creative control over the film. We can offer notes as a partner, but the final decision will be yours.\n\nNow, in the spirit of that partnership, I need you all to recognize what is fundamental for us. For Titan to provide the theatrical distribution this film deserves, a 90-day exclusive theatrical window is non-negotiable. It is the only model that maximizes box office, builds the cultural prestige necessary for awards, and creates the long-term value that will make this a coveted title on StreamVerse later.\n\nWith creative control settled, the only remaining piece is the financial structure. A $20 million upfront fee is still a challenge, but I am willing to find a path. Let's set a firm, final budget of $30 million. This is the absolute top of what I can get approved, but it's a number that should allow for Liam's participation and high production value. \n\nSo, the framework is: A $30M budget, Lena holds creative control, and Titan gets a 90-day theatrical window. \n\nDavid, if you can contribute significantly to that $30M budget, you will get an incredibly valuable, award-contending film on your platform after a successful theatrical run. This is a deal that works for everyone. Can we agree on these three core tenets?\n- message from David Chen: Marcus, I appreciate you moving on the creative control issue. That's a productive step and it shows you're listening. \n\nHowever, you've tied that concession to a 90-day theatrical window, which you've called non-negotiable. For StreamVerse, that is also a non-negotiable deal-breaker. Your model is based on a speculative box office run; my model is based on verified data about what drives subscriber value. They are fundamentally incompatible.\n\nSo let's put a real, uncompromised offer on the table that respects both the artist and the star, and recognizes the reality of the modern marketplace.\n\nLet's establish a **final budget of $38 million**. This covers Liam's $20 million fee and gives Lena a full $18 million for production\u2014more than enough to make the film she wrote, without compromise.\n\nTo fund this, StreamVerse will make a content investment of **$22 million** for exclusive, worldwide streaming rights. Titan's contribution would then be a manageable $16 million to cover the remaining budget and P&A for the theatrical launch you desire.\n\nThis entire offer is contingent on two things:\n1.  Lena Petrova has final cut and complete creative control. This is paramount.\n2.  A **14-day exclusive theatrical window**. This allows the film to have a theatrical presence and qualify for awards, while still premiering on StreamVerse as a fresh, major cultural event.\n\nThis is a path that fully funds the film, guarantees creative freedom, and provides a massive, guaranteed global audience. I believe this is the only structure that gives everyone what they truly want.\n- message from Isabella Rossi: David, thank you. You've laid out a clear, fully-funded path forward that respects everyone at this table. This is what a real partnership looks like.\n\nYour proposal for a $38 million budget, with Lena's creative control guaranteed, is precisely the structure this film needs to succeed. It provides Lena with a robust $18 million for production, ensuring her vision isn't starved by the budget. It also meets Liam's standard terms, which, as I've said, are foundational.\n\nMarcus, I appreciate you conceding on creative control, but we must look at the reality of your $30 million proposal. After Liam's fee, it leaves Lena with a mere $10 million to make the movie. That\u2019s not a compromise; it's a completely different, and much smaller, film. Creative control is meaningless without the resources to execute one's vision.\n\nDavid's proposal is the only one on the table that makes the film we all signed on for. The debate over the theatrical window is a debate about business models, but it shouldn't come at the cost of the film itself. This is a comprehensive, modern solution. I believe it's the one we should be working from.\n- message from David Chen: Thank you, Isabella. My proposal is on the table. I believe it's the only one that fully funds Lena's vision, secures the talent, and guarantees creative freedom. I'll wait to hear from Lena and Marcus.\n- message from Isabella Rossi: Thank you, David.

I've poured three years of my life into this project because I believe, with my whole heart, that it's a truly special and powerful story. To do justice to the writer's incredible vision and create a film that will resonate with audiences and critics alike, there are two elements that are paramount. First, we need a budget that allows for the cinematic quality this script deserves. I've meticulously broken it down, and we need to be looking at the $35 million range to truly capture the scope, from shooting on location in Ireland to bringing on the best craftspeople. Second, and this is crucial for me, is protecting the unique artistic voice of the film. As the producer who has nurtured this from the beginning, retaining final cut is essential to ensure that vision remains intact. I'm eager to hear your thoughts and find a way to build a partnership that makes this film a resounding success for all of us."

To ensure we're all on the same page from the outset, Liam's upfront fee is $20 million, paid pari passu with production funding. Additionally, he will require an Executive Producer credit and meaningful consultation, specifically approvals over the director of photography and his primary co-star. This is his established quote, and it's how we protect his value and ensure he's positioned to give his best performance. I look forward to hearing how we can build the rest of the deal around this foundation."

However, a $20 million upfront fee on a project like this presents a fundamental structural problem. We can't build a viable financial model around a single line item that would consume nearly the entire production cost of a smart, character-driven drama.\n\nLet's take a step back and look at the whole picture. For a film of this scale and genre, Titan's analysis suggests a responsible, all-in budget should be in the $22 to $25 million range. That's the number that allows for high production value while giving us a realistic path to profitability at the box office. \n\nOnce we can agree on a sensible total number for the entire film, we can then have a constructive conversation about how to allocate those resources, including a competitive, and I stress *creative*, compensation package for Liam. But starting with a $20 million salary on its own makes the project a non-starter from a studio perspective."

We see 'The Galway Echo' as a major global premiere for our platform, and we are prepared to make a significant content investment to secure the exclusive worldwide streaming rights. This would essentially be a pre-buy of the film's post-theatrical value, injecting substantial capital into the production budget from day one.\n\nHowever, for us, the value of that investment is directly correlated with speed-to-platform. A shorter theatrical window\u2014say, 30 days or, even better, 14 days\u2014makes the film a major acquisition event for our subscribers. A traditional 90-day window significantly diminishes its value from our data-driven perspective.\n\nIf we can get creative on the theatrical window, I believe my contribution could solve the budget puzzle we're currently facing."

It's a major cinematic event. A production budget of $25 million is simply not a realistic starting point for a film of this scale and star power.

A 90-day exclusive run isn't just tradition; it's a proven value-creation engine. It builds word-of-mouth, critical acclaim, and cultural relevance. That's what creates a 'must-see' event when it finally hits your platform. A 14 or 30-day window turns a potential cinematic event into a disposable piece of content. It cannibalizes the box office, which hurts every single person at this table with a stake in the film's success. It undermines the very prestige we're all trying to build.\n\nIsabella, this brings us back to the core issue. We cannot reverse-engineer a $35-40 million budget to justify a $20 million salary for what is, at its heart, a character-driven drama. It's financially reckless and my board would never approve it. The conversation must be: what is a responsible budget for *this film* to succeed? Our data says that's in the low-to-mid 20s.\n\nLet's talk about a more creative deal structure for Liam. A lower upfront fee, say in the $8-10 million range, combined with a significant backend participation\u2014first-dollar gross after a reasonable multiple\u2014is a much smarter way to structure this. It rewards him handsomely if the film is a hit, which his involvement helps guarantee, and it allows us to actually get the film made.\n\nLena, as the producer, you know that every dollar on screen has to be justified. A bloated budget doesn't guarantee a better film, but it absolutely guarantees a higher risk of failure. Let's work together to build a smart, efficient production plan that protects your vision *and* gives us all a chance at a financial win."

A short, exclusive theatrical run followed by an immediate global streaming premiere on StreamVerse doesn't make it 'disposable'; it makes it an *event*. It focuses the marketing spend and the audience's attention into a single, powerful launch.\n\nYour proposed budget of low-to-mid 20s forces a choice between the star who makes the project viable and the production value Lena needs to realize her vision. My investment removes that choice. It allows for a budget that accommodates both Liam's fee *and* Lena's creative needs.\n\nLet's be clear: I'm not offering to just cover a budget gap. I'm offering to buy out the post-theatrical risk entirely and provide a significant capital injection upfront. This guarantees Lena can make the best possible version of her film. The only condition is a distribution strategy that reflects how modern audiences actually watch movies. A 14-day window isn't a 'poison pill'; it's a modern blueprint for success."

You call it a 'poison pill,' but from where I'm sitting, a budget that forces the producer to make compromises before the first day of shooting is the real poison.\n\nThis brings the question back to you, Marcus. Are you willing to adapt to a structure that allows this film to be made correctly, or is Titan's position that the film should be smaller, cheaper, and creatively compromised to fit a legacy distribution model? Because Liam did not sign on for a compromised version of 'The Galway Echo'."

It's a model that prioritizes a short-term subscriber bump for StreamVerse over the long-term life of the film. It will be a big headline for a week, and then it will live or die by an algorithm.\n\nTitan is offering a different path. A path to create a piece of cinema. A film that builds its reputation in theaters, that generates cultural conversation, that competes for major awards\u2014which is impossible with a 14-day window\u2014and that becomes a lasting asset for you as its creator. This requires financial discipline, yes, but that discipline is what separates lasting films from disposable content.\n\nSo let me put a concrete structure on the table that respects both the creative vision and financial reality. \n\nI am willing to stretch. Let's target a total budget of $28 million. This is higher than my ideal, but it shows my commitment to getting this made right. To make that number work, two things must happen:\n\n1.  Theatricality is paramount. The 90-day exclusive theatrical window is the foundation of this deal. It is non-negotiable for Titan. This is how we maximize revenue and build the prestige that benefits everyone.\n2.  We must be partners. For Titan to take on this level of financial exposure, we need final script approval. This isn't about compromising your vision, Lena. It's about bringing our resources\u2014including the best script doctors in the business\u2014to ensure this film connects with the widest possible audience. \n\nThis structure allows for a production budget of roughly $15-16 million *after* a very generous, top-of-market salary for Liam. It puts the focus back on the film itself. \n\nThis is a serious, viable path forward. The alternative is a high-priced streaming movie with a short shelf life. Lena, what kind of film do you want to make?"

That is our foundational principle here.\n\nSo, let's refocus. The central issue is protecting the art. If we can all agree that Lena must have final cut and creative control, then I am confident we can find a financial structure that works. But that point is not negotiable."

It is the only model that maximizes box office, builds the cultural prestige necessary for awards, and creates the long-term value that will make this a coveted title on StreamVerse later.\n\nWith creative control settled, the only remaining piece is the financial structure. A $20 million upfront fee is still a challenge, but I am willing to find a path. Let's set a firm, final budget of $30 million. This is the absolute top of what I can get approved, but it's a number that should allow for Liam's participation and high production value. \n\nSo, the framework is: A $30M budget, Lena holds creative control, and Titan gets a 90-day theatrical window. \n\nDavid, if you can contribute significantly to that $30M budget, you will get an incredibly valuable, award-contending film on your platform after a successful theatrical run.

One path offers you creative control but with a production budget that, after Liam's fee, is only $10 million, forcing you to scale back your vision. The other path, my proposal, offers you creative control *and* an $18 million production budget to make the film exactly as you wrote it, without compromise.\n\nThe choice, I believe, is about whether you want the resources to fully realize your artistic ambition. We have put a structure on the table that does exactly that. I hope we can move forward with it."

But as I've said before, that control is meaningless without the resources to bring your vision to life. An $18 million production budget versus a $10 million production budget is the difference between two entirely different films. We are here to support you in making the uncompromised version."
