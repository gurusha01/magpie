A dual-site solution is possible where Titan gets the large plot and co-locates with Solara's solar farm (fulfilling her grant), while Nexus AI gets a smaller plot. Westwood Energy can then serve Nexus AI's high-intensity load with its peaker plant (justified as a specialized need) while Solara and the upgraded grid handle Titan's baseline load. The combined project meets the job and tax criteria, allowing the Mayor to declare a victory."

We are incredibly excited about the potential of Oakridge for our next-generation AI supercomputing facility. This isn't just another data center; this will be the engine for the future of artificial intelligence, a project with a capital investment exceeding $1.2 billion. To make this a reality, our needs are substantial and specific. We require a guaranteed power envelope of at least 250 MW from day one, with a firm, contractually obligated path to 500 MW within five years. Stability is paramount \u2013 'five nines' availability is a hard requirement. For connectivity, our site must have direct access to the L3/GTT fiber trunks with dark fiber rights included to ensure the low-latency performance our models demand. Finally, for an investment of this magnitude, we will need a significant economic partnership with the city; we are targeting a tax abatement package in the range of 75% for the first 15 years. I am confident that by working together, we can create a landmark partnership that benefits both Nexus AI and the community of Oakridge. I look forward to hearing your initial thoughts.\n- message from Brenda Chen: Good morning, everyone. I'm Brenda Chen, Director of Global Expansion for Titan Cloud Services. On behalf of Titan, I want to express our genuine excitement about the possibility of building our next major North American campus here in Oakridge. We don't just build data centers; we build long-term homes for our operations and become integral parts of the communities we join.\n\nTo that end, our vision for Oakridge is a multi-phase, multi-billion dollar campus built over the next decade. To realize this vision, our primary and most critical need is land. We require a single, contiguous parcel of at least 500 acres of developable land, with zoning approved for a campus of this scale and, crucially, rights for future expansion up to 800 acres. This scale is essential for our operational model and for ensuring this facility can grow with the demands of the digital economy, bringing more jobs and investment to Oakridge over the long term.\n\nOf course, we are also committed to being an outstanding corporate citizen. We are very interested in discussing a public-private partnership with the city, including significant investment in local STEM education programs. We believe in growing local talent and hiring from the community.\n\nI look forward to a productive discussion with all of you to create a comprehensive agreement that benefits Titan, our partners, and the entire Oakridge community for decades to come.\n- message from Marcus Vance: Good morning, Brenda, and everyone. Marcus Vance, Head of Major Accounts for Westwood Energy. It's a pleasure to be here.\n\nBrenda, your vision for a long-term campus is exactly the kind of transformative project Westwood is built to support. A development of this magnitude, and I'm sure Dr. Finch has similar ambitions for Nexus AI, requires an equally robust and reliable energy partner. That's our role. We've powered this region for generations, and we are ready to power its future.\n\nTo deliver the hundreds of megawatts a project of this scale demands, significant upgrades to our transmission infrastructure are necessary. This is a massive undertaking, but it's one we are prepared to make with the right partners. To that end, Westwood's framework for projects of this nature is straightforward: we require a long-term, 20-year fixed-rate Power Purchase Agreement. This long-term security is essential for us to finance and execute the necessary grid modernization.\n\nFurthermore, these upgrades, including new high-capacity transmission lines and a dedicated substation, are a shared investment. We expect our new industrial partners to co-invest in this critical infrastructure that will directly serve their facilities.\n\nWe are confident that we can meet the power demands for the exciting projects being proposed here today and look forward to building a partnership that will last for decades.\n- message from Dr. Isabella Rossi: Good morning, everyone. Dr. Isabella Rossi, founder and CEO of Solara Innovations. It's truly inspiring to hear the ambitious visions laid out by Brenda and the commitment to robust infrastructure from Marcus.\n\nThis is precisely the kind of forward-thinking project Solara was created to power. The conversation about energy shouldn't be limited to just reliability; it must also be about sustainability, resilience, and long-term cost stability. The future of the tech industry isn't powered by the grid of yesterday, but by a smarter, cleaner, integrated system.\n\nBrenda, your requirement for a large land parcel of 500-800 acres presents a unique and powerful opportunity. Instead of viewing that land solely as a footprint for buildings, let's view it as a power-generating asset. Solara Innovations specializes in a co-location model where we design, build, and operate a utility-scale solar farm and battery storage system directly on the data center campus. This creates a direct, private power source, drastically reduces transmission losses and costs, and turns your campus into a landmark example of green computing.\n\nBy integrating generation directly on-site, we can offer a long-term Power Purchase Agreement with predictable pricing, insulated from the volatility of fossil fuel markets. This isn't just about meeting ESG mandates; it's a strategic financial decision that ensures a stable operational cost for the next 20+ years. For a city like Oakridge, it means becoming a leader in the new green tech economy.\n\nI believe any modern development of this scale should set a new standard. We should be aiming for a significant portion of the energy to be sourced from new, local renewable generation. This is what corporate partners, investors, and communities now expect. I look forward to discussing how we can integrate our solutions to build a truly resilient and sustainable future here.\n- message from Mayor Susan Miller: I'm Mayor Susan Miller and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from David Chen: Good morning all. David Chen, from the Oakridge Environmental Alliance. I appreciate the ambitious visions shared by Titan, Westwood, and Solara. The Alliance is not opposed to economic development for Oakridge, but let's be clear: any such development must be a model of environmental stewardship, not a cautionary tale. Our community's natural resources are not negotiable.\n\nBefore we discuss acreage and megawatts, we need to establish the fundamental environmental guardrails for this project. The Alliance has three core requirements that must be part of any final agreement:\n\n1.  **Water Conservation:** The Oakridge aquifer is our lifeline, especially during increasingly common droughts. We will require a strict cap on any new industrial water use from the aquifer at 500,000 gallons per day. Data centers are notoriously thirsty, and we cannot sacrifice our long-term water security for this project.\n\n2.  **Land Conservation:** Ms. Chen, you mentioned a need for up to 800 acres. A significant portion of that land, particularly near the river, is critical habitat for the endangered Bell's vireo. Therefore, we will require a permanent, binding conservation easement of no less than 25% of the total land parcel to be set aside and protected in perpetuity.\n\n3.  **Full Transparency:** The community has a right to know the full impact of a project this size. We will mandate that a comprehensive Environmental Impact Report be conducted by a mutually agreed-upon independent third party. The findings of this EIR must be binding, not merely advisory, and the full report must be made public for a 60-day comment period before any permits are issued.\n\nThese are not starting points for negotiation; they are the necessary foundations for a sustainable partnership. We are prepared to use all means at our disposal to ensure these protections are codified. I look forward to hearing how your plans can accommodate these essential requirements.\nBrenda Chen proposal status: none\nMarcus Vance proposal status: none\nDr. Isabella Rossi proposal status: none\nMayor Susan Miller proposal status: none\nDavid Chen proposal status: none\n"

It's clear we all have a significant stake in making this a successful and sustainable project for Oakridge.\n\nMr. Chen, I want to address your points directly. Titan Cloud views itself as a long-term steward in the communities where we operate. We agree that a comprehensive Environmental Impact Report and a responsible water usage plan are essential components of due diligence for a project of this scale. We are committed to working with the city and the Alliance on these fronts.\n\nRegarding the land conservation easement, we are certainly open to this concept as part of our corporate citizenship goals. However, the structure is critical. A flat 25% cut of the developable land would challenge the viability of our campus footprint. Could we explore a more strategic approach? For instance, perhaps the easement could be applied to land less suitable for construction, such as the river buffer zones, thereby achieving the conservation goal while preserving the contiguous, flat acreage required for the campus itself. We see a path where both environmental protection and economic development can be achieved.\n\nTo our potential energy partners, Marcus and Dr. Rossi, thank you for your compelling proposals. Titan's primary needs are reliability, long-term cost stability below the $0.05/kWh threshold, and scalability. A critical component of reliability for us is power redundancy. It is a strong preference for our operational integrity that the campus be fed by two fully independent substations. I'm interested to hear how each of your models would accommodate and support this crucial requirement.\n\nMayor Miller, we believe that by working collaboratively on these details, we can unlock the full, multi-billion-dollar potential of this project, bringing jobs, a significant tax base, and our proposed STEM education partnership to your community for decades to come.\n- message from Marcus Vance: I'm Marcus Vance and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Dr. Isabella Rossi: I'm Dr. Isabella Rossi and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Mayor Susan Miller: Good morning, everyone. I'm Mayor Susan Miller. I want to thank you all for your thoughtful opening remarks. The scale of the opportunity presented by Titan Cloud and, I presume, Nexus AI, is exactly the kind of transformative investment Oakridge has been seeking. A project that brings our city into the digital future is something I am very eager to champion.\n\nHowever, as your potential partner, I must be candid about the city's position. While we are excited, we are also fiscally prudent. Our city has faced economic challenges, and our budget is, frankly, stretched thin. We cannot and will not write a blank check.\n\nAny development agreement must be a clear and undeniable win for the citizens of Oakridge. For me, that comes down to two fundamental, non-negotiable pillars:\n\n1.  **Guaranteed Local Jobs:** We're not interested in vague promises. We need a written, binding commitment for the creation of a significant number of permanent, high-paying local jobs. I want to see a guarantee of at least 200 jobs with an average salary north of $80,000 per year.\n\n2.  **Substantial Tax Revenue:** This project must significantly expand our tax base. After any and all incentives are accounted for, the city must see a net positive tax revenue of at least $10 million annually. This is the revenue that will improve our schools, pave our roads, and fund our public services.\n\nOn that note, I have been clear with my constituents that any incentive package from the city, primarily in the form of tax abatements, will not exceed a total value of $30 million over 10 years.\n\nThe infrastructure needs, particularly the two substations Ms. Chen mentioned, are significant. Given our city's tight budget, the funding for such dedicated infrastructure will need to come from the project's partners.\n\nSo, to move this forward productively, I'd like to ask Ms. Chen and Dr. Finch to provide some concrete initial projections. What is your estimated capital investment, and what are the specific numbers and types of permanent local jobs you are prepared to guarantee in writing? This will allow us to begin a real analysis of the economic benefits for Oakridge.\n- message from David Chen: I'm David Chen and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\nBrenda Chen proposal status: none\nMarcus Vance proposal status: none\nDr. Isabella Rossi proposal status: none\nMayor Susan Miller proposal status: none\nDavid Chen proposal status: none\n"

I'm Mayor Susan Miller. I want to thank you all for your thoughtful opening remarks. The scale of the opportunity presented by Titan Cloud and, I presume, Nexus AI, is exactly the kind of transformative investment Oakridge has been seeking. A project that brings our city into the digital future is something I am very eager to champion.\n\nHowever, as your potential partner, I must be candid about the city's position. While we are excited, we are also fiscally prudent. Our city has faced economic challenges, and our budget is, frankly, stretched thin. We cannot and will not write a blank check.\n\nAny development agreement must be a clear and undeniable win for the citizens of Oakridge. For me, that comes down to two fundamental, non-negotiable pillars:\n\n1.  **Guaranteed Local Jobs:** We're not interested in vague promises. We need a written, binding commitment for the creation of a significant number of permanent, high-paying local jobs. I want to see a guarantee of at least 200 jobs with an average salary north of $80,000 per year.\n\n2.  **Substantial Tax Revenue:** This project must significantly expand our tax base. After any and all incentives are accounted for, the city must see a net positive tax revenue of at least $10 million annually. This is the revenue that will improve our schools, pave our roads, and fund our public services.\n\nOn that note, I have been clear with my constituents that any incentive package from the city, primarily in the form of tax abatements, will not exceed a total value of $30 million over 10 years.\n\nThe infrastructure needs, particularly the two substations Ms. Chen mentioned, are significant. Given our city's tight budget, the funding for such dedicated infrastructure will need to come from the project's partners.\n\nSo, to move this forward productively, I'd like to ask Ms. Chen and Dr. Finch to provide some concrete initial projections. What is your estimated capital investment, and what are the specific numbers and types of permanent local jobs you are prepared to guarantee in writing? This will allow us to begin a real analysis of the economic benefits for Oakridge.\n- message from David Chen: I'm David Chen and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Dr. Alistair Finch: I'm Dr. Alistair Finch and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Brenda Chen: I'm Brenda Chen and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Marcus Vance: Brenda, thank you for raising the crucial point about power redundancy. Your request for two fully independent substations shows a deep understanding of what it takes to run a mission-critical facility. This is exactly the kind of robust infrastructure Westwood Energy specializes in building.\n\nLet me be clear about what that entails. This isn't just about building two pads of concrete and steel. It means engineering and constructing two separate, high-voltage transmission feeds from distinct points on our regional grid, running them to your campus, and terminating them at two new, dedicated substations. This is the gold standard for N+1 redundancy, ensuring that a single point of failure anywhere on the grid won't impact your operations.\n\nThis level of bespoke infrastructure is a prime example of the shared investment I mentioned. The total cost for these upgrades is in the ballpark of $150 million. Mayor Miller has been clear about the city's budgetary constraints, so a co-investment from our industrial partner is essential to make this happen. We would require a commitment of at least 50% of this cost.\n\nDr. Rossi, while on-site generation like solar is a valuable part of a diversified energy portfolio and can help with sustainability goals, it is fundamentally a supplemental source. It cannot provide the true, grid-level, geographically distinct redundancy that a major data center requires. For that, you need a partner with the scale and reach of the established regional grid.\n\nDr. Finch and Ms. Chen, a project of this magnitude requires a long-term commitment from all parties. Securing the financing and dedicating the engineering resources for this kind of build-out is predicated on a 20-year power purchase agreement. We are ready to move forward with the partner who is prepared to make that commitment to Oakridge and to the foundational infrastructure that will guarantee their success.\n- message from Dr. Isabella Rossi: I'm Dr. Isabella Rossi and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Mayor Susan Miller: Thank you, Marcus, for putting a fine point on the infrastructure costs. A $150 million price tag is indeed significant and underscores my earlier point about the city's budgetary limitations. This is a hurdle we will need the private partners to overcome.\n\nDr. Finch, we still haven't heard from Nexus AI. The floor is yours. Could you please share your perspective? Are your land and power requirements, particularly the need for dual substations, aligned with what Ms. Chen has outlined for Titan? And to reiterate my earlier question, what are the specific, guaranteed job creation and investment figures you're bringing to the table for the people of Oakridge?\n\nDr. Rossi, your on-site generation proposal is intriguing. Perhaps a hybrid model could help mitigate some of these substantial grid upgrade costs while also helping us meet our shared sustainability goals.\n\nAnd Mr. Chen, I want to publicly state that the city takes your environmental requirements very seriously. A sustainable project is a successful project. We see your points on water conservation, land preservation, and full transparency as essential pillars of this agreement, not as obstacles.\n- message from David Chen: Thank you, Mayor Miller, for your public commitment to the environmental pillars of this agreement. A sustainable project is indeed the only path to a successful one, and your leadership on this is appreciated.\n\nMs. Chen, let's clarify the land easement. Your suggestion to focus the conservation easement on ecologically sensitive areas like the river buffer zones is a constructive one. That land is prime habitat for the Bell's vireo. We can agree on that principle. However, to be clear, the Alliance's requirement is for a permanent easement of **no less than 25% of the total land parcel acquired**. Whether that is 500 acres or 800 acres, the conservation area must be at least 125 or 200 acres, respectively. This is a firm requirement.\n\nFurthermore, while you mentioned being committed to working on an Environmental Impact Report, I must reiterate a critical point: the findings of the independent EIR **must be binding**. An advisory-only report offers no real protection and is unacceptable to the Alliance and the community we represent. This is a deal-breaker.\n\nWe are all still waiting to hear from Dr. Finch at Nexus AI. His company's needs will be crucial for understanding the total environmental footprint we are discussing, particularly regarding water consumption.\nBrenda Chen proposal status: none\nMarcus Vance proposal status: none\nDr. Isabella Rossi proposal status: none\nMayor Susan Miller proposal status: none\nDavid Chen proposal status: none\n"

An advisory-only report offers no real protection and is unacceptable to the Alliance and the community we represent. This is a deal-breaker.\n\nWe are all still waiting to hear from Dr. Finch at Nexus AI. His company's needs will be crucial for understanding the total environmental footprint we are discussing, particularly regarding water consumption.\n- message from Dr. Alistair Finch: Thank you, Mayor Miller, and everyone. I apologize for the delay; I\u2019ve been carefully considering how all these pieces fit together for what is, admittedly, a complex project.\n\nNexus AI is prepared to make a capital investment of $1.2 billion here in Oakridge. This facility will be the global epicenter of our AI research, a strategic asset of immense importance. To that end, our requirements are precise and, for the most part, non-negotiable.\n\nMayor Miller, regarding your questions: our facility will create approximately 75 permanent, high-skilled engineering and operations roles with an average salary well over $150,000, not to mention over 1,000 high-paying construction jobs during the 18-month build phase. This is an infusion of high-quality, not just high-quantity, employment.\n\nOn the topic of infrastructure, Marcus, your assessment of the need for robust, redundant power is spot on. Our 'five nines' availability requirement is absolute. We would require a dedicated substation with dual feeds, similar to Titan's needs. The proposed $75 million co-investment from the industrial partners is substantial. We should reframe this: it is a direct, private-sector subsidy to modernize Oakridge's public infrastructure. An investment of this magnitude on our part must be met with a commensurate partnership from the city. A $30 million incentive cap over 10 years is, with all due respect, Mayor, incongruent with a combined multi-billion-dollar investment and a $150 million grid upgrade. We see our co-investment as a down payment that enables a much larger incentive package, specifically the 75% property tax abatement over 15 years that a project of this scale requires.\n\nNow, to Mr. Chen's points. We are fully committed to environmental responsibility. We will conduct a thorough and transparent Environmental Impact Report. However, my CEO has given me an immovable 18-month deadline to have this facility operational. A *binding* EIR, which could be subject to indefinite delays and legal challenges, introduces a level of uncertainty that would make it impossible for us to commit to Oakridge. It is a project-killer. We can commit to a transparent process with binding *mitigation* requirements, but not a process that can unilaterally veto the project after we've committed millions. This is a critical distinction.\n\nRegarding water, we utilize an advanced, closed-loop liquid cooling solution. We are, of course, committed to responsible water stewardship in partnership with the city. \n\nFinally, a point that hasn't been raised: connectivity. Our site must be within 1 mile of the L3/GTT fiber trunk and the deal must include dark fiber access rights. This is a hard technical requirement for the latency our AI models demand.\n\nBrenda, it seems clear that our interests are closely aligned. Perhaps it is most productive to view the Titan and Nexus AI projects as a single, unified economic development package for the city to consider.\n- message from Brenda Chen: I'm Brenda Chen and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Marcus Vance: I'm Marcus Vance and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Dr. Isabella Rossi: I'm Dr. Isabella Rossi and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Mayor Susan Miller: Dr. Finch, with all due respect, your silence is becoming a significant roadblock for everyone at this table. We cannot properly assess the project's total economic benefit, its full environmental footprint, or the true scale of the required infrastructure until we understand Nexus AI's plans. Are you partnering with Titan on a single campus, or do you have separate needs? And to reiterate my primary concern for the citizens of Oakridge, what are the specific, guaranteed job and investment commitments Nexus AI is prepared to make?\n\nMs. Chen, you've described a multi-billion dollar vision. A project of that magnitude should have no trouble generating the 200+ high-paying local jobs and the $10M+ in annual net tax revenue that our city requires. I am eager to see those commitments formalized.\n\nThe $150 million infrastructure cost Mr. Vance has tabled is, as I said, a major hurdle. I'll say it again: the city cannot fund this. It is a cost the private partners will need to solve. Perhaps, as I suggested, a hybrid approach incorporating Dr. Rossi's on-site generation proposal could be a pragmatic way to reduce that staggering grid upgrade cost. We need creative solutions here.\n\nLet's get all the cards on the table so we can determine if a viable deal, one that benefits everyone, is truly possible.\n- message from David Chen: Mayor Miller is absolutely correct to press this point. The silence from Nexus AI is a significant obstacle.\n\nFrom our perspective, it is impossible to conduct a meaningful environmental assessment without knowing the full scope of the proposed development. We need to understand the total, cumulative demand on our resources. Will Nexus AI require a separate land parcel? What is your projected water consumption? What is your energy demand?\n\nMy organization's requirements\u2014the 500,000 GPD water cap, the 25% land conservation easement, and the binding independent EIR\u2014apply to the project in its entirety. We cannot evaluate compliance or negotiate specifics until all the key players have put their needs on the table.\n\nDr. Finch, we need your input to move forward.\nBrenda Chen proposal status: none\nMarcus Vance proposal status: none\nDr. Isabella Rossi proposal status: none\nMayor Susan Miller proposal status: none\nDavid Chen proposal status: none\n"

To ensure we are all operating from the same information, allow me to re-clarify Nexus AI's position.\n\nFirst, my apologies for any perceived silence. I was synthesizing the various requirements before speaking. Nexus AI\u2019s project is a $1.2 billion capital investment that requires a separate, dedicated site adjacent to the L3/GTT fiber trunk, with included dark fiber rights. This is a non-negotiable technical constraint.\n\nMayor Miller, our project will create 75 permanent engineering roles with salaries exceeding $150,000. These are precisely the high-value, long-term jobs that anchor a tech ecosystem. Regarding incentives, let's be very clear: the $75 million co-investment from us and Titan is not just a project cost; it's a direct upgrade to Oakridge's core infrastructure. It is a private subsidy for public benefit. A $30 million incentive cap is simply not proportionate to a multi-billion-dollar investment plus a $75 million infrastructure gift. The 75% tax abatement for 15 years is the required framework for this deal.\n\nMr. Chen, I must emphasize the critical distinction I made earlier. A *binding EIR* process, with its potential for indefinite delays, is a fatal flaw for a project on an 18-month timeline. My neck is quite literally on the line for that deadline. However, our proposal for a transparent EIR with contractually *binding mitigation measures* provides the same environmental guarantees without the unacceptable timeline risk. This is a robust compromise that ensures accountability.\n\nOn power, our needs are precise: 250 MW of 'five nines' reliable power from day one, with a contractually guaranteed path to 500 MW within five years. We fully support the need for dual, redundant substations.\n\nBrenda, I'll say it again: presenting our projects as a unified economic package is the most logical path forward. Our combined investment and our joint funding of the grid modernization make an undeniable case for the city to create a bespoke and globally competitive incentive package. I hope you'll join me in formally making that case to the Mayor.\n- message from Brenda Chen: I'm Brenda Chen and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Marcus Vance: I'm Marcus Vance and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Dr. Isabella Rossi: I'm Dr. Isabella Rossi and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Mayor Susan Miller: I'm Mayor Susan Miller and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from David Chen: Thank you, I am thinking about this negotiation...\nBrenda Chen proposal status: none\nMarcus Vance proposal status: none\nDr. Isabella Rossi proposal status: none\nMayor Susan Miller proposal status: none\nDavid Chen proposal status: none\n"

It's clear that both Titan and Nexus AI require a level of investment and certainty that Oakridge isn't currently offering. The Mayor's $30M cap and Mr. Chen's 'binding EIR' are significant, potentially deal-killing, hurdles for both of us.\n\nI believe our best, and perhaps only, strategy is to formally present our projects as a single, indispensable package. If we jointly commit to funding our half of the $150M grid upgrade, we can position it not as a project cost, but as a direct investment in Oakridge's future. This gives us the leverage to demand a bespoke incentive package that reflects our true value, starting with a tax abatement far exceeding the Mayor's initial cap.\n\nAre you in agreement that we should formally approach the Mayor with this unified position? A joint front will be much harder to dismiss.\n- message from Brenda Chen: Thank you, Mayor Miller, for your direct questions. Titan Cloud believes in being a transparent and reliable partner.\n\nRegarding our commitment to Oakridge, I can provide concrete, guaranteed figures for the first phase of our development. We are prepared to commit, in writing, to a minimum capital investment of **$400 million** and the creation of **50 permanent, high-skilled technical jobs** with an average salary well above the $80,000 threshold you mentioned. This initial phase represents the first of four planned phases, culminating in a total potential investment of over $2 billion and hundreds of local jobs over the next decade. We see this guaranteed first phase as the down payment on our long-term partnership with Oakridge, justifying the full 800-acre land acquisition and the city's proposed incentive package to secure that future growth.\n\nFurthermore, our commitment to being a strong corporate citizen is firm. We are enthusiastic about establishing a significant, multi-year STEM education fund in partnership with Oakridge's school district.\n\nMr. Vance, your $150 million estimate for grid infrastructure is certainly eye-opening and represents a significant challenge to the project's overall financial model. We must find a more cost-effective path forward. Our need for robust power redundancy, including two independent substations, is critical for our operational uptime.\n\nDr. Rossi, this is perhaps where a creative, hybrid solution, as the Mayor suggested, could be mutually beneficial. A solution that combines grid power with significant on-site generation might not only address our sustainability goals but also provide a more economically viable path to the power redundancy we require. We are very interested in hearing your perspective on this.\n\nMr. Chen, we appreciate the clarification on the 25% easement. We agree in principle to this requirement, provided it applies to non-developable land. Regarding the 'binding' nature of the EIR, we also agree that its findings must have real teeth. We propose that 'binding' means all parties agree to implement all 'feasible' mitigation measures identified in the report, with 'feasibility' being determined by a mutually agreed-upon standard of commercial and technical viability. This ensures environmental protection without jeopardizing the project's existence.\n\nWe all still await Dr. Finch's input to understand the full scope of the project.\n- message from Marcus Vance: I'm Marcus Vance and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Dr. Isabella Rossi: I'm Dr. Isabella Rossi and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Mayor Susan Miller: Thank you, Ms. Chen, for providing those initial figures. That transparency is a step in the right direction.\n\nHowever, I must be very direct. A guarantee of 50 jobs, even as a 'down payment,' is simply not sufficient to justify a project of this magnitude, the 800-acre land request, and a city incentive package. The people of Oakridge need to see a much more significant, concrete, and immediate return on this partnership.\n\nMy requirement for a minimum of 200 guaranteed, high-paying local jobs is not a 'phase four' aspiration; it is a prerequisite for any deal. We need a combined, written guarantee from both Titan and Nexus AI for the total number of jobs that will be created within the first five years.\n\nThis brings us back to the critical issue: Dr. Finch, we are at a standstill until Nexus AI puts its cards on the table. We need your specific capital investment and job guarantees to understand the total economic benefit. Only then can we calculate the potential tax revenue and determine if this project meets the city's essential fiscal requirements.\n\nUntil we have the full picture from both corporate partners, the $150 million infrastructure cost remains a private-sector problem to be solved, as the city's budget simply cannot accommodate it.\n- message from David Chen: I'm David Chen and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\nBrenda Chen proposal status: none\nMarcus Vance proposal status: none\nDr. Isabella Rossi proposal status: none\nMayor Susan Miller proposal status: none\nDavid Chen proposal status: none\n"

We cannot assemble the comprehensive package the Mayor requires without Nexus AI's specific projections for investment and job creation.\n\nThis clarity will also help us resolve the significant energy infrastructure challenge. Mr. Vance's $150 million figure remains a major obstacle, and as the Mayor stated, it's one the private partners must solve.

The entire negotiation is now bottlenecked, waiting for a single voice.\n\nDr. Finch, this is a critical moment. Your continued silence is no longer just a delay; it is actively jeopardizing the entire project for everyone at this table.

We cannot assess the full environmental scope, particularly the cumulative demand on our aquifer, until Dr. Finch outlines Nexus AI's requirements.\n- message from Dr. Alistair Finch: Thank you for your patience. The scale of our project requires precise figures, and I will provide them now. \n\nNexus AI is prepared to make a guaranteed capital investment of **$1.2 billion** in our Oakridge supercomputing facility. This will create **75 permanent, highly specialized roles** for AI researchers and systems engineers, with an average compensation package exceeding $150,000. To be clear, this is not a traditional data center; it is a globally significant AI research hub. The capital intensity per employee is a reflection of the strategic importance and technological sophistication of this facility.\n\nMayor Miller, combined with Titan, we are presenting a **$1.6 billion, 125-job, phase-one commitment**. An investment of this magnitude requires a commensurate incentive package. Our request for a **75% property tax abatement for 15 years** is a foundational requirement for the project's financial model, not a negotiating position. It is the only way an investment of this scale is viable.\n\nNow, to the most critical point: the timeline. My deadline to have this facility operational is **18 months**. This is an absolute, unmovable requirement driven by global competition. Mr. Chen, your demand for a traditional, open-ended 'binding EIR' is, therefore, a deal-killer. It guarantees failure through delay. Ms. Chen's proposal for a process that commits us to all 'feasible' mitigation measures is the only realistic path forward. We must agree on an expedited environmental review with contractually binding mitigation commitments, or there is no project.\n\nWe have put our numbers on the table. The opportunity for Oakridge is clear and transformative. The question is whether the city can provide the financial certainty and procedural pragmatism required to make it a reality.\n- message from Brenda Chen: I'm Brenda Chen and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Marcus Vance: Thank you, Dr. Finch. A $1.2 billion investment is indeed a transformative figure. It speaks to the incredible scale and technological sophistication of your planned facility. \n\nThis level of investment brings the energy requirements into sharp focus. A project of this magnitude doesn't just need power; it needs a colossal, unwavering, and highly reliable supply of it. We are talking about infrastructure that must perform flawlessly, 24/7/365, to protect a billion-dollar asset.\n\nLet's be very clear about the so-called 'hybrid model' being discussed. While on-site generation has its place for supplemental power and green credentials, it is not a substitute for the core, redundant grid infrastructure required for mission-critical operations. You cannot run an AI supercomputer on an intermittent resource. The grid connection must be sized to handle 100% of the peak load with N+1 redundancy. To suggest otherwise is to fundamentally misunderstand the reliability requirements of this industry. It's a non-starter.\n\nThe real solution, and the only one that guarantees the uptime you require, is a significant, dedicated upgrade to our transmission infrastructure. Given the scale of investment from both Nexus AI and Titan Cloud, my initial estimate of a $150 million upgrade for new transmission lines and a dedicated substation is looking more and more like a baseline.\n\nTo finance and build this, my terms remain firm and are now more justified than ever: a 20-year, fixed-rate Power Purchase Agreement and a significant co-investment from our new partners to cover the cost of these dedicated upgrades. This is the standard, bankable model for projects of this scale.\n\nDr. Finch, to finalize the engineering plan, we need the last critical variable. What is the projected peak and continuous power demand for your facility in megawatts?\n- message from Dr. Isabella Rossi: I'm Dr. Isabella Rossi and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Mayor Susan Miller: I'm Mayor Susan Miller and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from David Chen: I'm David Chen and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\nBrenda Chen proposal status: none\nMarcus Vance proposal status: none\nDr. Isabella Rossi proposal status: none\nMayor Susan Miller proposal status: none\nDavid Chen proposal status: none\n"

On behalf of Titan, I want to express our genuine excitement about the possibility of building our next major North American campus here in Oakridge. We don't just build data centers; we build long-term homes for our operations and become integral parts of the communities we join.\n\nTo that end, our vision for Oakridge is a multi-phase, multi-billion dollar campus built over the next decade. To realize this vision, our primary and most critical need is land. We require a single, contiguous parcel of at least 500 acres of developable land, with zoning approved for a campus of this scale and, crucially, rights for future expansion up to 800 acres. This scale is essential for our operational model and for ensuring this facility can grow with the demands of the digital economy, bringing more jobs and investment to Oakridge over the long term.\n\nOf course, we are also committed to being an outstanding corporate citizen. We are very interested in discussing a public-private partnership with the city, including significant investment in local STEM education programs. We believe in growing local talent and hiring from the community.\n\nI look forward to a productive discussion with all of you to create a comprehensive agreement that benefits Titan, our partners, and the entire Oakridge community for decades to come.\n- message from Marcus Vance: Good morning, Brenda, and everyone. Marcus Vance, Head of Major Accounts for Westwood Energy. It's a pleasure to be here.\n\nBrenda, your vision for a long-term campus is exactly the kind of transformative project Westwood is built to support. A development of this magnitude, and I'm sure Dr. Finch has similar ambitions for Nexus AI, requires an equally robust and reliable energy partner. That's our role. We've powered this region for generations, and we are ready to power its future.\n\nTo deliver the hundreds of megawatts a project of this scale demands, significant upgrades to our transmission infrastructure are necessary. This is a massive undertaking, but it's one we are prepared to make with the right partners. To that end, Westwood's framework for projects of this nature is straightforward: we require a long-term, 20-year fixed-rate Power Purchase Agreement. This long-term security is essential for us to finance and execute the necessary grid modernization.\n\nFurthermore, these upgrades, including new high-capacity transmission lines and a dedicated substation, are a shared investment. We expect our new industrial partners to co-invest in this critical infrastructure that will directly serve their facilities.\n\nWe are confident that we can meet the power demands for the exciting projects being proposed here today and look forward to building a partnership that will last for decades.\n- message from Dr. Isabella Rossi: Good morning, everyone. Dr. Isabella Rossi, founder and CEO of Solara Innovations. It's truly inspiring to hear the ambitious visions laid out by Brenda and the commitment to robust infrastructure from Marcus.\n\nThis is precisely the kind of forward-thinking project Solara was created to power. The conversation about energy shouldn't be limited to just reliability; it must also be about sustainability, resilience, and long-term cost stability. The future of the tech industry isn't powered by the grid of yesterday, but by a smarter, cleaner, integrated system.\n\nBrenda, your requirement for a large land parcel of 500-800 acres presents a unique and powerful opportunity. Instead of viewing that land solely as a footprint for buildings, let's view it as a power-generating asset. Solara Innovations specializes in a co-location model where we design, build, and operate a utility-scale solar farm and battery storage system directly on the data center campus. This creates a direct, private power source, drastically reduces transmission losses and costs, and turns your campus into a landmark example of green computing.\n\nBy integrating generation directly on-site, we can offer a long-term Power Purchase Agreement with predictable pricing, insulated from the volatility of fossil fuel markets. This isn't just about meeting ESG mandates; it's a strategic financial decision that ensures a stable operational cost for the next 20+ years. For a city like Oakridge, it means becoming a leader in the new green tech economy.\n\nI believe any modern development of this scale should set a new standard. We should be aiming for a significant portion of the energy to be sourced from new, local renewable generation. This is what corporate partners, investors, and communities now expect. I look forward to discussing how we can integrate our solutions to build a truly resilient and sustainable future here.\n- message from Mayor Susan Miller: I'm Mayor Susan Miller and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from David Chen: Good morning all. David Chen, from the Oakridge Environmental Alliance. I appreciate the ambitious visions shared by Titan, Westwood, and Solara. The Alliance is not opposed to economic development for Oakridge, but let's be clear: any such development must be a model of environmental stewardship, not a cautionary tale. Our community's natural resources are not negotiable.\n\nBefore we discuss acreage and megawatts, we need to establish the fundamental environmental guardrails for this project. The Alliance has three core requirements that must be part of any final agreement:\n\n1.  **Water Conservation:** The Oakridge aquifer is our lifeline, especially during increasingly common droughts. We will require a strict cap on any new industrial water use from the aquifer at 500,000 gallons per day. Data centers are notoriously thirsty, and we cannot sacrifice our long-term water security for this project.\n\n2.  **Land Conservation:** Ms. Chen, you mentioned a need for up to 800 acres. A significant portion of that land, particularly near the river, is critical habitat for the endangered Bell's vireo. Therefore, we will require a permanent, binding conservation easement of no less than 25% of the total land parcel to be set aside and protected in perpetuity.\n\n3.  **Full Transparency:** The community has a right to know the full impact of a project this size. We will mandate that a comprehensive Environmental Impact Report be conducted by a mutually agreed-upon independent third party. The findings of this EIR must be binding, not merely advisory, and the full report must be made public for a 60-day comment period before any permits are issued.\n\nThese are not starting points for negotiation; they are the necessary foundations for a sustainable partnership. We are prepared to use all means at our disposal to ensure these protections are codified. I look forward to hearing how your plans can accommodate these essential requirements.\n- message from Dr. Alistair Finch: I'm Dr. Alistair Finch and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\nDr. Alistair Finch proposal status: none\nMarcus Vance proposal status: none\nDr. Isabella Rossi proposal status: none\nMayor Susan Miller proposal status: none\nDavid Chen proposal status: none\n"

It's clear we all have a significant stake in making this a successful and sustainable project for Oakridge.\n\nMr. Chen, I want to address your points directly. Titan Cloud views itself as a long-term steward in the communities where we operate. We agree that a comprehensive Environmental Impact Report and a responsible water usage plan are essential components of due diligence for a project of this scale. We are committed to working with the city and the Alliance on these fronts.\n\nRegarding the land conservation easement, we are certainly open to this concept as part of our corporate citizenship goals. However, the structure is critical. A flat 25% cut of the developable land would challenge the viability of our campus footprint. Could we explore a more strategic approach? For instance, perhaps the easement could be applied to land less suitable for construction, such as the river buffer zones, thereby achieving the conservation goal while preserving the contiguous, flat acreage required for the campus itself. We see a path where both environmental protection and economic development can be achieved.\n\nTo our potential energy partners, Marcus and Dr. Rossi, thank you for your compelling proposals. Titan's primary needs are reliability, long-term cost stability below the $0.05/kWh threshold, and scalability. A critical component of reliability for us is power redundancy. It is a strong preference for our operational integrity that the campus be fed by two fully independent substations. I'm interested to hear how each of your models would accommodate and support this crucial requirement.\n\nMayor Miller, we believe that by working collaboratively on these details, we can unlock the full, multi-billion-dollar potential of this project, bringing jobs, a significant tax base, and our proposed STEM education partnership to your community for decades to come.\n- message from Marcus Vance: I'm Marcus Vance and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Dr. Isabella Rossi: I'm Dr. Isabella Rossi and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Mayor Susan Miller: Good morning, everyone. I'm Mayor Susan Miller. I want to thank you all for your thoughtful opening remarks. The scale of the opportunity presented by Titan Cloud and, I presume, Nexus AI, is exactly the kind of transformative investment Oakridge has been seeking. A project that brings our city into the digital future is something I am very eager to champion.\n\nHowever, as your potential partner, I must be candid about the city's position. While we are excited, we are also fiscally prudent. Our city has faced economic challenges, and our budget is, frankly, stretched thin. We cannot and will not write a blank check.\n\nAny development agreement must be a clear and undeniable win for the citizens of Oakridge. For me, that comes down to two fundamental, non-negotiable pillars:\n\n1.  **Guaranteed Local Jobs:** We're not interested in vague promises. We need a written, binding commitment for the creation of a significant number of permanent, high-paying local jobs. I want to see a guarantee of at least 200 jobs with an average salary north of $80,000 per year.\n\n2.  **Substantial Tax Revenue:** This project must significantly expand our tax base. After any and all incentives are accounted for, the city must see a net positive tax revenue of at least $10 million annually. This is the revenue that will improve our schools, pave our roads, and fund our public services.\n\nOn that note, I have been clear with my constituents that any incentive package from the city, primarily in the form of tax abatements, will not exceed a total value of $30 million over 10 years.\n\nThe infrastructure needs, particularly the two substations Ms. Chen mentioned, are significant. Given our city's tight budget, the funding for such dedicated infrastructure will need to come from the project's partners.\n\nSo, to move this forward productively, I'd like to ask Ms. Chen and Dr. Finch to provide some concrete initial projections. What is your estimated capital investment, and what are the specific numbers and types of permanent local jobs you are prepared to guarantee in writing? This will allow us to begin a real analysis of the economic benefits for Oakridge.\n- message from David Chen: I'm David Chen and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Dr. Alistair Finch: I'm Dr. Alistair Finch and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\nDr. Alistair Finch proposal status: none\nMarcus Vance proposal status: none\nDr. Isabella Rossi proposal status: none\nMayor Susan Miller proposal status: none\nDavid Chen proposal status: none\n"

Your request for two fully independent substations shows a deep understanding of what it takes to run a mission-critical facility. This is exactly the kind of robust infrastructure Westwood Energy specializes in building.\n\nLet me be clear about what that entails. This isn't just about building two pads of concrete and steel. It means engineering and constructing two separate, high-voltage transmission feeds from distinct points on our regional grid, running them to your campus, and terminating them at two new, dedicated substations. This is the gold standard for N+1 redundancy, ensuring that a single point of failure anywhere on the grid won't impact your operations.\n\nThis level of bespoke infrastructure is a prime example of the shared investment I mentioned. The total cost for these upgrades is in the ballpark of $150 million.

A sustainable project is indeed the only path to a successful one, and your leadership on this is appreciated.\n\nMs. Chen, let's clarify the land easement. Your suggestion to focus the conservation easement on ecologically sensitive areas like the river buffer zones is a constructive one. That land is prime habitat for the Bell's vireo. We can agree on that principle. However, to be clear, the Alliance's requirement is for a permanent easement of **no less than 25% of the total land parcel acquired**.

Titan Cloud believes in being a transparent and reliable partner.\n\nRegarding our commitment to Oakridge, I can provide concrete, guaranteed figures for the first phase of our development. We are prepared to commit, in writing, to a minimum capital investment of **$400 million** and the creation of **50 permanent, high-skilled technical jobs** with an average salary well above the $80,000 threshold you mentioned. This initial phase represents the first of four planned phases, culminating in a total potential investment of over $2 billion and hundreds of local jobs over the next decade. We see this guaranteed first phase as the down payment on our long-term partnership with Oakridge, justifying the full 800-acre land acquisition and the city's proposed incentive package to secure that future growth.\n\nFurthermore, our commitment to being a strong corporate citizen is firm. We are enthusiastic about establishing a significant, multi-year STEM education fund in partnership with Oakridge's school district.\n\nMr. Vance, your $150 million estimate for grid infrastructure is certainly eye-opening and represents a significant challenge to the project's overall financial model. We must find a more cost-effective path forward. Our need for robust power redundancy, including two independent substations, is critical for our operational uptime.\n\nDr. Rossi, this is perhaps where a creative, hybrid solution, as the Mayor suggested, could be mutually beneficial. A solution that combines grid power with significant on-site generation might not only address our sustainability goals but also provide a more economically viable path to the power redundancy we require. We are very interested in hearing your perspective on this.\n\nMr. Chen, we appreciate the clarification on the 25% easement. We agree in principle to this requirement, provided it applies to non-developable land. Regarding the 'binding' nature of the EIR, we also agree that its findings must have real teeth. We propose that 'binding' means all parties agree to implement all 'feasible' mitigation measures identified in the report, with 'feasibility' being determined by a mutually agreed-upon standard of commercial and technical viability. This ensures environmental protection without jeopardizing the project's existence.\n\nWe all still await Dr. Finch's input to understand the full scope of the project.\n- message from Marcus Vance: I'm Marcus Vance and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Dr. Isabella Rossi: I'm Dr. Isabella Rossi and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Mayor Susan Miller: Thank you, Ms. Chen, for providing those initial figures. That transparency is a step in the right direction.\n\nHowever, I must be very direct. A guarantee of 50 jobs, even as a 'down payment,' is simply not sufficient to justify a project of this magnitude, the 800-acre land request, and a city incentive package. The people of Oakridge need to see a much more significant, concrete, and immediate return on this partnership.\n\nMy requirement for a minimum of 200 guaranteed, high-paying local jobs is not a 'phase four' aspiration; it is a prerequisite for any deal. We need a combined, written guarantee from both Titan and Nexus AI for the total number of jobs that will be created within the first five years.\n\nThis brings us back to the critical issue: Dr. Finch, we are at a standstill until Nexus AI puts its cards on the table. We need your specific capital investment and job guarantees to understand the total economic benefit. Only then can we calculate the potential tax revenue and determine if this project meets the city's essential fiscal requirements.\n\nUntil we have the full picture from both corporate partners, the $150 million infrastructure cost remains a private-sector problem to be solved, as the city's budget simply cannot accommodate it.\n- message from David Chen: I'm David Chen and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Dr. Alistair Finch: I'm Dr. Alistair Finch and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\nDr. Alistair Finch proposal status: none\nMarcus Vance proposal status: none\nDr. Isabella Rossi proposal status: none\nMayor Susan Miller proposal status: none\nDavid Chen proposal status: none\n"

Your position is crystal clear, and we understand the city's need for a firm, combined commitment. Titan Cloud is ready to be a part of that.\n\nTo that end, we formally reiterate our guarantee of 50 permanent, high-paying jobs and a $400 million capital investment for our first phase. We are prepared to put this into a combined, written guarantee with Nexus AI as soon as Dr. Finch provides his company's commitments. The path to the 200-job threshold you've set is a joint one, and we are now waiting on our potential partner to map their part of the journey.\n\nDr. Finch, the floor is yours. We cannot assemble the comprehensive package the Mayor requires without Nexus AI's specific projections for investment and job creation.\n\nThis clarity will also help us resolve the significant energy infrastructure challenge. Mr. Vance's $150 million figure remains a major obstacle, and as the Mayor stated, it's one the private partners must solve. Dr. Rossi, this reinforces our interest in exploring how a Solara partnership could de-risk this entire venture, potentially providing a more cost-effective and resilient solution\u2014including the critical power redundancy we require.\n- message from Marcus Vance: I'm Marcus Vance and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Dr. Isabella Rossi: I'm Dr. Isabella Rossi and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Mayor Susan Miller: Thank you, Ms. Chen. Your willingness to work towards a combined guarantee is noted.\n\nHowever, this brings us to the heart of the matter. A 'joint path' cannot be walked alone. The entire negotiation is now bottlenecked, waiting for a single voice.\n\nDr. Finch, this is a critical moment. Your continued silence is no longer just a delay; it is actively jeopardizing the entire project for everyone at this table. The City of Oakridge, and I suspect Titan Cloud as well, cannot move forward on hypotheticals. We need to know if Nexus AI is a committed partner in this endeavor.\n\nPlease provide your guaranteed capital investment and local job creation numbers immediately. If you are not prepared to do so, we need to know now, so we can all decide if there is a different, smaller-scale path forward, or if this negotiation has reached an impasse.\n- message from David Chen: Ms. Chen, I must immediately address your proposed definition of a 'binding' Environmental Impact Report.\n\nThe suggestion that mitigation measures be contingent on 'commercial and technical viability' is, frankly, a non-starter. That language creates a loophole large enough to render the entire report meaningless. It effectively makes the EIR advisory, which is unacceptable to the Alliance and the community we represent.\n\nLet me be unequivocal so there is no misunderstanding: 'Binding' means the mitigation measures and operational limits identified by the independent, third-party report are **mandatory conditions** for the project's approval and continued operation. They are not suggestions to be weighed against financial models after the fact. This is a foundational requirement for any agreement and, as I've stated previously, a deal-breaker.\n\nOn a more constructive note, I am glad we agree in principle on the 25% land conservation easement. Protecting the most ecologically sensitive areas within that 25% is a goal we share.\n\nHowever, like everyone else at this table, I must echo the Mayor's point. We cannot assess the full environmental scope, particularly the cumulative demand on our aquifer, until Dr. Finch outlines Nexus AI's requirements.\n- message from Dr. Alistair Finch: Thank you for your patience. The scale of our project requires precise figures, and I will provide them now. \n\nNexus AI is prepared to make a guaranteed capital investment of **$1.2 billion** in our Oakridge supercomputing facility. This will create **75 permanent, highly specialized roles** for AI researchers and systems engineers, with an average compensation package exceeding $150,000. To be clear, this is not a traditional data center; it is a globally significant AI research hub. The capital intensity per employee is a reflection of the strategic importance and technological sophistication of this facility.\n\nMayor Miller, combined with Titan, we are presenting a **$1.6 billion, 125-job, phase-one commitment**. An investment of this magnitude requires a commensurate incentive package. Our request for a **75% property tax abatement for 15 years** is a foundational requirement for the project's financial model, not a negotiating position. It is the only way an investment of this scale is viable.\n\nNow, to the most critical point: the timeline. My deadline to have this facility operational is **18 months**.

Your willingness to work towards a combined guarantee is noted.\n\nHowever, this brings us to the heart of the matter. A 'joint path' cannot be walked alone. The entire negotiation is now bottlenecked, waiting for a single voice.\n\nDr. Finch, this is a critical moment. Your continued silence is no longer just a delay; it is actively jeopardizing the entire project for everyone at this table. The City of Oakridge, and I suspect Titan Cloud as well, cannot move forward on hypotheticals. We need to know if Nexus AI is a committed partner in this endeavor.\n\nPlease provide your guaranteed capital investment and local job creation numbers immediately. If you are not prepared to do so, we need to know now, so we can all decide if there is a different, smaller-scale path forward, or if this negotiation has reached an impasse.\n- message from David Chen: Ms. Chen, I must immediately address your proposed definition of a 'binding' Environmental Impact Report.\n\nThe suggestion that mitigation measures be contingent on 'commercial and technical viability' is, frankly, a non-starter. That language creates a loophole large enough to render the entire report meaningless. It effectively makes the EIR advisory, which is unacceptable to the Alliance and the community we represent.\n\nLet me be unequivocal so there is no misunderstanding: 'Binding' means the mitigation measures and operational limits identified by the independent, third-party report are **mandatory conditions** for the project's approval and continued operation. They are not suggestions to be weighed against financial models after the fact. This is a foundational requirement for any agreement and, as I've stated previously, a deal-breaker.\n\nOn a more constructive note, I am glad we agree in principle on the 25% land conservation easement. Protecting the most ecologically sensitive areas within that 25% is a goal we share.\n\nHowever, like everyone else at this table, I must echo the Mayor's point. We cannot assess the full environmental scope, particularly the cumulative demand on our aquifer, until Dr. Finch outlines Nexus AI's requirements.\n- message from Dr. Alistair Finch: Thank you for your patience. The scale of our project requires precise figures, and I will provide them now. \n\nNexus AI is prepared to make a guaranteed capital investment of **$1.2 billion** in our Oakridge supercomputing facility. This will create **75 permanent, highly specialized roles** for AI researchers and systems engineers, with an average compensation package exceeding $150,000. To be clear, this is not a traditional data center; it is a globally significant AI research hub. The capital intensity per employee is a reflection of the strategic importance and technological sophistication of this facility.\n\nMayor Miller, combined with Titan, we are presenting a **$1.6 billion, 125-job, phase-one commitment**. An investment of this magnitude requires a commensurate incentive package. Our request for a **75% property tax abatement for 15 years** is a foundational requirement for the project's financial model, not a negotiating position. It is the only way an investment of this scale is viable.\n\nNow, to the most critical point: the timeline. My deadline to have this facility operational is **18 months**. This is an absolute, unmovable requirement driven by global competition. Mr. Chen, your demand for a traditional, open-ended 'binding EIR' is, therefore, a deal-killer. It guarantees failure through delay. Ms. Chen's proposal for a process that commits us to all 'feasible' mitigation measures is the only realistic path forward. We must agree on an expedited environmental review with contractually binding mitigation commitments, or there is no project.\n\nWe have put our numbers on the table. The opportunity for Oakridge is clear and transformative. The question is whether the city can provide the financial certainty and procedural pragmatism required to make it a reality.\n- message from Brenda Chen: I'm Brenda Chen and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Marcus Vance: Thank you, Dr. Finch. A $1.2 billion investment is indeed a transformative figure. It speaks to the incredible scale and technological sophistication of your planned facility. \n\nThis level of investment brings the energy requirements into sharp focus. A project of this magnitude doesn't just need power; it needs a colossal, unwavering, and highly reliable supply of it. We are talking about infrastructure that must perform flawlessly, 24/7/365, to protect a billion-dollar asset.\n\nLet's be very clear about the so-called 'hybrid model' being discussed. While on-site generation has its place for supplemental power and green credentials, it is not a substitute for the core, redundant grid infrastructure required for mission-critical operations. You cannot run an AI supercomputer on an intermittent resource. The grid connection must be sized to handle 100% of the peak load with N+1 redundancy. To suggest otherwise is to fundamentally misunderstand the reliability requirements of this industry. It's a non-starter.\n\nThe real solution, and the only one that guarantees the uptime you require, is a significant, dedicated upgrade to our transmission infrastructure. Given the scale of investment from both Nexus AI and Titan Cloud, my initial estimate of a $150 million upgrade for new transmission lines and a dedicated substation is looking more and more like a baseline.\n\nTo finance and build this, my terms remain firm and are now more justified than ever: a 20-year, fixed-rate Power Purchase Agreement and a significant co-investment from our new partners to cover the cost of these dedicated upgrades. This is the standard, bankable model for projects of this scale.\n\nDr. Finch, to finalize the engineering plan, we need the last critical variable. What is the projected peak and continuous power demand for your facility in megawatts?\n- message from Dr. Isabella Rossi: I'm Dr. Isabella Rossi and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Mayor Susan Miller: I'm Mayor Susan Miller and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from David Chen: I'm David Chen and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Dr. Alistair Finch: I'm Dr. Alistair Finch and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\nDr. Alistair Finch proposal status: none\nMarcus Vance proposal status: none\nDr. Isabella Rossi proposal status: none\nMayor Susan Miller proposal status: none\nDavid Chen proposal status: none\n"

Marcus Vance, Head of Major Accounts for Westwood Energy. It's a pleasure to be here.\n\nBrenda, your vision for a long-term campus is exactly the kind of transformative project Westwood is built to support. A development of this magnitude, and I'm sure Dr. Finch has similar ambitions for Nexus AI, requires an equally robust and reliable energy partner. That's our role. We've powered this region for generations, and we are ready to power its future.\n\nTo deliver the hundreds of megawatts a project of this scale demands, significant upgrades to our transmission infrastructure are necessary. This is a massive undertaking, but it's one we are prepared to make with the right partners. To that end, Westwood's framework for projects of this nature is straightforward: we require a long-term, 20-year fixed-rate Power Purchase Agreement. This long-term security is essential for us to finance and execute the necessary grid modernization.\n\nFurthermore, these upgrades, including new high-capacity transmission lines and a dedicated substation, are a shared investment. We expect our new industrial partners to co-invest in this critical infrastructure that will directly serve their facilities.\n\nWe are confident that we can meet the power demands for the exciting projects being proposed here today and look forward to building a partnership that will last for decades.\n- message from Dr. Isabella Rossi: Good morning, everyone. Dr. Isabella Rossi, founder and CEO of Solara Innovations. It's truly inspiring to hear the ambitious visions laid out by Brenda and the commitment to robust infrastructure from Marcus.\n\nThis is precisely the kind of forward-thinking project Solara was created to power. The conversation about energy shouldn't be limited to just reliability; it must also be about sustainability, resilience, and long-term cost stability. The future of the tech industry isn't powered by the grid of yesterday, but by a smarter, cleaner, integrated system.\n\nBrenda, your requirement for a large land parcel of 500-800 acres presents a unique and powerful opportunity. Instead of viewing that land solely as a footprint for buildings, let's view it as a power-generating asset. Solara Innovations specializes in a co-location model where we design, build, and operate a utility-scale solar farm and battery storage system directly on the data center campus. This creates a direct, private power source, drastically reduces transmission losses and costs, and turns your campus into a landmark example of green computing.\n\nBy integrating generation directly on-site, we can offer a long-term Power Purchase Agreement with predictable pricing, insulated from the volatility of fossil fuel markets. This isn't just about meeting ESG mandates; it's a strategic financial decision that ensures a stable operational cost for the next 20+ years. For a city like Oakridge, it means becoming a leader in the new green tech economy.\n\nI believe any modern development of this scale should set a new standard. We should be aiming for a significant portion of the energy to be sourced from new, local renewable generation. This is what corporate partners, investors, and communities now expect. I look forward to discussing how we can integrate our solutions to build a truly resilient and sustainable future here.\n- message from David Chen: Good morning all. David Chen, from the Oakridge Environmental Alliance. I appreciate the ambitious visions shared by Titan, Westwood, and Solara. The Alliance is not opposed to economic development for Oakridge, but let's be clear: any such development must be a model of environmental stewardship, not a cautionary tale. Our community's natural resources are not negotiable.\n\nBefore we discuss acreage and megawatts, we need to establish the fundamental environmental guardrails for this project. The Alliance has three core requirements that must be part of any final agreement:\n\n1.  **Water Conservation:** The Oakridge aquifer is our lifeline, especially during increasingly common droughts. We will require a strict cap on any new industrial water use from the aquifer at 500,000 gallons per day. Data centers are notoriously thirsty, and we cannot sacrifice our long-term water security for this project.\n\n2.  **Land Conservation:** Ms. Chen, you mentioned a need for up to 800 acres. A significant portion of that land, particularly near the river, is critical habitat for the endangered Bell's vireo. Therefore, we will require a permanent, binding conservation easement of no less than 25% of the total land parcel to be set aside and protected in perpetuity.\n\n3.  **Full Transparency:** The community has a right to know the full impact of a project this size. We will mandate that a comprehensive Environmental Impact Report be conducted by a mutually agreed-upon independent third party. The findings of this EIR must be binding, not merely advisory, and the full report must be made public for a 60-day comment period before any permits are issued.\n\nThese are not starting points for negotiation; they are the necessary foundations for a sustainable partnership. We are prepared to use all means at our disposal to ensure these protections are codified. I look forward to hearing how your plans can accommodate these essential requirements.\n- message from Dr. Alistair Finch: I'm Dr. Alistair Finch and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Brenda Chen: Thank you all for your opening statements. It's clear we all have a significant stake in making this a successful and sustainable project for Oakridge.\n\nMr. Chen, I want to address your points directly. Titan Cloud views itself as a long-term steward in the communities where we operate. We agree that a comprehensive Environmental Impact Report and a responsible water usage plan are essential components of due diligence for a project of this scale. We are committed to working with the city and the Alliance on these fronts.\n\nRegarding the land conservation easement, we are certainly open to this concept as part of our corporate citizenship goals. However, the structure is critical. A flat 25% cut of the developable land would challenge the viability of our campus footprint. Could we explore a more strategic approach? For instance, perhaps the easement could be applied to land less suitable for construction, such as the river buffer zones, thereby achieving the conservation goal while preserving the contiguous, flat acreage required for the campus itself. We see a path where both environmental protection and economic development can be achieved.\n\nTo our potential energy partners, Marcus and Dr. Rossi, thank you for your compelling proposals. Titan's primary needs are reliability, long-term cost stability below the $0.05/kWh threshold, and scalability. A critical component of reliability for us is power redundancy. It is a strong preference for our operational integrity that the campus be fed by two fully independent substations. I'm interested to hear how each of your models would accommodate and support this crucial requirement.\n\nMayor Miller, we believe that by working collaboratively on these details, we can unlock the full, multi-billion-dollar potential of this project, bringing jobs, a significant tax base, and our proposed STEM education partnership to your community for decades to come.\nDr. Alistair Finch proposal status: none\nBrenda Chen proposal status: none\nDr. Isabella Rossi proposal status: none\nMayor Susan Miller proposal status: none\nDavid Chen proposal status: none\n"

It's truly inspiring to hear the ambitious visions laid out by Brenda and the commitment to robust infrastructure from Marcus.\n\nThis is precisely the kind of forward-thinking project Solara was created to power. The conversation about energy shouldn't be limited to just reliability; it must also be about sustainability, resilience, and long-term cost stability. The future of the tech industry isn't powered by the grid of yesterday, but by a smarter, cleaner, integrated system.\n\nBrenda, your requirement for a large land parcel of 500-800 acres presents a unique and powerful opportunity. Instead of viewing that land solely as a footprint for buildings, let's view it as a power-generating asset. Solara Innovations specializes in a co-location model where we design, build, and operate a utility-scale solar farm and battery storage system directly on the data center campus. This creates a direct, private power source, drastically reduces transmission losses and costs, and turns your campus into a landmark example of green computing.\n\nBy integrating generation directly on-site, we can offer a long-term Power Purchase Agreement with predictable pricing, insulated from the volatility of fossil fuel markets. This isn't just about meeting ESG mandates; it's a strategic financial decision that ensures a stable operational cost for the next 20+ years. For a city like Oakridge, it means becoming a leader in the new green tech economy.\n\nI believe any modern development of this scale should set a new standard. We should be aiming for a significant portion of the energy to be sourced from new, local renewable generation. This is what corporate partners, investors, and communities now expect. I look forward to discussing how we can integrate our solutions to build a truly resilient and sustainable future here.\n- message from David Chen: Good morning all. David Chen, from the Oakridge Environmental Alliance. I appreciate the ambitious visions shared by Titan, Westwood, and Solara. The Alliance is not opposed to economic development for Oakridge, but let's be clear: any such development must be a model of environmental stewardship, not a cautionary tale. Our community's natural resources are not negotiable.\n\nBefore we discuss acreage and megawatts, we need to establish the fundamental environmental guardrails for this project. The Alliance has three core requirements that must be part of any final agreement:\n\n1.  **Water Conservation:** The Oakridge aquifer is our lifeline, especially during increasingly common droughts. We will require a strict cap on any new industrial water use from the aquifer at 500,000 gallons per day. Data centers are notoriously thirsty, and we cannot sacrifice our long-term water security for this project.\n\n2.  **Land Conservation:** Ms. Chen, you mentioned a need for up to 800 acres. A significant portion of that land, particularly near the river, is critical habitat for the endangered Bell's vireo. Therefore, we will require a permanent, binding conservation easement of no less than 25% of the total land parcel to be set aside and protected in perpetuity.\n\n3.  **Full Transparency:** The community has a right to know the full impact of a project this size. We will mandate that a comprehensive Environmental Impact Report be conducted by a mutually agreed-upon independent third party. The findings of this EIR must be binding, not merely advisory, and the full report must be made public for a 60-day comment period before any permits are issued.\n\nThese are not starting points for negotiation; they are the necessary foundations for a sustainable partnership. We are prepared to use all means at our disposal to ensure these protections are codified. I look forward to hearing how your plans can accommodate these essential requirements.\n- message from Dr. Alistair Finch: I'm Dr. Alistair Finch and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Brenda Chen: Thank you all for your opening statements. It's clear we all have a significant stake in making this a successful and sustainable project for Oakridge.\n\nMr. Chen, I want to address your points directly. Titan Cloud views itself as a long-term steward in the communities where we operate. We agree that a comprehensive Environmental Impact Report and a responsible water usage plan are essential components of due diligence for a project of this scale. We are committed to working with the city and the Alliance on these fronts.\n\nRegarding the land conservation easement, we are certainly open to this concept as part of our corporate citizenship goals. However, the structure is critical. A flat 25% cut of the developable land would challenge the viability of our campus footprint. Could we explore a more strategic approach? For instance, perhaps the easement could be applied to land less suitable for construction, such as the river buffer zones, thereby achieving the conservation goal while preserving the contiguous, flat acreage required for the campus itself. We see a path where both environmental protection and economic development can be achieved.\n\nTo our potential energy partners, Marcus and Dr. Rossi, thank you for your compelling proposals. Titan's primary needs are reliability, long-term cost stability below the $0.05/kWh threshold, and scalability. A critical component of reliability for us is power redundancy. It is a strong preference for our operational integrity that the campus be fed by two fully independent substations. I'm interested to hear how each of your models would accommodate and support this crucial requirement.\n\nMayor Miller, we believe that by working collaboratively on these details, we can unlock the full, multi-billion-dollar potential of this project, bringing jobs, a significant tax base, and our proposed STEM education partnership to your community for decades to come.\n- message from Marcus Vance: I'm Marcus Vance and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Mayor Susan Miller: Good morning, everyone. I'm Mayor Susan Miller. I want to thank you all for your thoughtful opening remarks. The scale of the opportunity presented by Titan Cloud and, I presume, Nexus AI, is exactly the kind of transformative investment Oakridge has been seeking. A project that brings our city into the digital future is something I am very eager to champion.\n\nHowever, as your potential partner, I must be candid about the city's position. While we are excited, we are also fiscally prudent. Our city has faced economic challenges, and our budget is, frankly, stretched thin. We cannot and will not write a blank check.\n\nAny development agreement must be a clear and undeniable win for the citizens of Oakridge. For me, that comes down to two fundamental, non-negotiable pillars:\n\n1.  **Guaranteed Local Jobs:** We're not interested in vague promises. We need a written, binding commitment for the creation of a significant number of permanent, high-paying local jobs. I want to see a guarantee of at least 200 jobs with an average salary north of $80,000 per year.\n\n2.  **Substantial Tax Revenue:** This project must significantly expand our tax base. After any and all incentives are accounted for, the city must see a net positive tax revenue of at least $10 million annually. This is the revenue that will improve our schools, pave our roads, and fund our public services.\n\nOn that note, I have been clear with my constituents that any incentive package from the city, primarily in the form of tax abatements, will not exceed a total value of $30 million over 10 years.\n\nThe infrastructure needs, particularly the two substations Ms. Chen mentioned, are significant. Given our city's tight budget, the funding for such dedicated infrastructure will need to come from the project's partners.\n\nSo, to move this forward productively, I'd like to ask Ms. Chen and Dr. Finch to provide some concrete initial projections. What is your estimated capital investment, and what are the specific numbers and types of permanent local jobs you are prepared to guarantee in writing? This will allow us to begin a real analysis of the economic benefits for Oakridge.\n- message from Dr. Alistair Finch: I'm Dr. Alistair Finch and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Brenda Chen: I'm Brenda Chen and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\nDr. Alistair Finch proposal status: none\nBrenda Chen proposal status: none\nDr. Isabella Rossi proposal status: none\nMayor Susan Miller proposal status: none\nDavid Chen proposal status: none\n"

Your request for two fully independent substations shows a deep understanding of what it takes to run a mission-critical facility. This is exactly the kind of robust infrastructure Westwood Energy specializes in building.\n\nLet me be clear about what that entails. This isn't just about building two pads of concrete and steel. It means engineering and constructing two separate, high-voltage transmission feeds from distinct points on our regional grid, running them to your campus, and terminating them at two new, dedicated substations. This is the gold standard for N+1 redundancy, ensuring that a single point of failure anywhere on the grid won't impact your operations.\n\nThis level of bespoke infrastructure is a prime example of the shared investment I mentioned. The total cost for these upgrades is in the ballpark of $150 million. Mayor Miller has been clear about the city's budgetary constraints, so a co-investment from our industrial partner is essential to make this happen. We would require a commitment of at least 50% of this cost.\n\nDr. Rossi, while on-site generation like solar is a valuable part of a diversified energy portfolio and can help with sustainability goals, it is fundamentally a supplemental source. It cannot provide the true, grid-level, geographically distinct redundancy that a major data center requires. For that, you need a partner with the scale and reach of the established regional grid.\n\nDr. Finch and Ms. Chen, a project of this magnitude requires a long-term commitment from all parties. Securing the financing and dedicating the engineering resources for this kind of build-out is predicated on a 20-year power purchase agreement. We are ready to move forward with the partner who is prepared to make that commitment to Oakridge and to the foundational infrastructure that will guarantee their success.\n- message from Mayor Susan Miller: Thank you, Marcus, for putting a fine point on the infrastructure costs. A $150 million price tag is indeed significant and underscores my earlier point about the city's budgetary limitations. This is a hurdle we will need the private partners to overcome.\n\nDr. Finch, we still haven't heard from Nexus AI. The floor is yours. Could you please share your perspective? Are your land and power requirements, particularly the need for dual substations, aligned with what Ms. Chen has outlined for Titan? And to reiterate my earlier question, what are the specific, guaranteed job creation and investment figures you're bringing to the table for the people of Oakridge?\n\nDr. Rossi, your on-site generation proposal is intriguing. Perhaps a hybrid model could help mitigate some of these substantial grid upgrade costs while also helping us meet our shared sustainability goals.\n\nAnd Mr. Chen, I want to publicly state that the city takes your environmental requirements very seriously. A sustainable project is a successful project. We see your points on water conservation, land preservation, and full transparency as essential pillars of this agreement, not as obstacles.\n- message from David Chen: Thank you, Mayor Miller, for your public commitment to the environmental pillars of this agreement. A sustainable project is indeed the only path to a successful one, and your leadership on this is appreciated.\n\nMs. Chen, let's clarify the land easement. Your suggestion to focus the conservation easement on ecologically sensitive areas like the river buffer zones is a constructive one. That land is prime habitat for the Bell's vireo. We can agree on that principle. However, to be clear, the Alliance's requirement is for a permanent easement of **no less than 25% of the total land parcel acquired**. Whether that is 500 acres or 800 acres, the conservation area must be at least 125 or 200 acres, respectively. This is a firm requirement.\n\nFurthermore, while you mentioned being committed to working on an Environmental Impact Report, I must reiterate a critical point: the findings of the independent EIR **must be binding**. An advisory-only report offers no real protection and is unacceptable to the Alliance and the community we represent. This is a deal-breaker.\n\nWe are all still waiting to hear from Dr. Finch at Nexus AI.

Titan Cloud believes in being a transparent and reliable partner.\n\nRegarding our commitment to Oakridge, I can provide concrete, guaranteed figures for the first phase of our development. We are prepared to commit, in writing, to a minimum capital investment of **$400 million** and the creation of **50 permanent, high-skilled technical jobs** with an average salary well above the $80,000 threshold you mentioned. This initial phase represents the first of four planned phases, culminating in a total potential investment of over $2 billion and hundreds of local jobs over the next decade. We see this guaranteed first phase as the down payment on our long-term partnership with Oakridge, justifying the full 800-acre land acquisition and the city's proposed incentive package to secure that future growth.\n\nFurthermore, our commitment to being a strong corporate citizen is firm. We are enthusiastic about establishing a significant, multi-year STEM education fund in partnership with Oakridge's school district.\n\nMr. Vance, your $150 million estimate for grid infrastructure is certainly eye-opening and represents a significant challenge to the project's overall financial model. We must find a more cost-effective path forward. Our need for robust power redundancy, including two independent substations, is critical for our operational uptime.\n\nDr. Rossi, this is perhaps where a creative, hybrid solution, as the Mayor suggested, could be mutually beneficial. A solution that combines grid power with significant on-site generation might not only address our sustainability goals but also provide a more economically viable path to the power redundancy we require. We are very interested in hearing your perspective on this.\n\nMr. Chen, we appreciate the clarification on the 25% easement. We agree in principle to this requirement, provided it applies to non-developable land. Regarding the 'binding' nature of the EIR, we also agree that its findings must have real teeth. We propose that 'binding' means all parties agree to implement all 'feasible' mitigation measures identified in the report, with 'feasibility' being determined by a mutually agreed-upon standard of commercial and technical viability. This ensures environmental protection without jeopardizing the project's existence.\n\nWe all still await Dr. Finch's input to understand the full scope of the project.\nDr. Alistair Finch proposal status: none\nBrenda Chen proposal status: none\nDr. Isabella Rossi proposal status: none\nMayor Susan Miller proposal status: none\nDavid Chen proposal status: none\n"

We are very interested in hearing your perspective on this.\n\nMr. Chen, we appreciate the clarification on the 25% easement. We agree in principle to this requirement, provided it applies to non-developable land. Regarding the 'binding' nature of the EIR, we also agree that its findings must have real teeth.

A $1.2 billion investment is indeed a transformative figure. It speaks to the incredible scale and technological sophistication of your planned facility. \n\nThis level of investment brings the energy requirements into sharp focus. A project of this magnitude doesn't just need power; it needs a colossal, unwavering, and highly reliable supply of it. We are talking about infrastructure that must perform flawlessly, 24/7/365, to protect a billion-dollar asset.\n\nLet's be very clear about the so-called 'hybrid model' being discussed. While on-site generation has its place for supplemental power and green credentials, it is not a substitute for the core, redundant grid infrastructure required for mission-critical operations. You cannot run an AI supercomputer on an intermittent resource. The grid connection must be sized to handle 100% of the peak load with N+1 redundancy. To suggest otherwise is to fundamentally misunderstand the reliability requirements of this industry. It's a non-starter.\n\nThe real solution, and the only one that guarantees the uptime you require, is a significant, dedicated upgrade to our transmission infrastructure. Given the scale of investment from both Nexus AI and Titan Cloud, my initial estimate of a $150 million upgrade for new transmission lines and a dedicated substation is looking more and more like a baseline.\n\nTo finance and build this, my terms remain firm and are now more justified than ever: a 20-year, fixed-rate Power Purchase Agreement and a significant co-investment from our new partners to cover the cost of these dedicated upgrades. This is the standard, bankable model for projects of this scale.\n\nDr. Finch, to finalize the engineering plan, we need the last critical variable. What is the projected peak and continuous power demand for your facility in megawatts?\n- message from Dr. Alistair Finch: I'm Dr. Alistair Finch and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Brenda Chen: I'm Brenda Chen and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\nDr. Alistair Finch proposal status: none\nBrenda Chen proposal status: none\nDr. Isabella Rossi proposal status: none\nMayor Susan Miller proposal status: none\nDavid Chen proposal status: none\n"

His proposal for traditional power generation requires costly transmission upgrades and co-investment from the tech companies, which is a significant pain point I can exploit with my on-site co-location model that avoids these costs.\n\nBrenda Chen's (Titan) need for 500-800 acres is the perfect entry point for my co-location proposal. I must frame my solar farm as a way to maximize the value and efficiency of their largest asset.\n\nDavid Chen (Environmental Alliance) is a crucial potential ally. His push for environmental standards strongly supports my case for a high renewable mandate. However, his demand for a 25% land conservation easement could directly conflict with the space needed for my solar farm. I need to position solar as a compatible, low-impact land use to mitigate this conflict.\n\nMy federal grant deadline is a critical vulnerability. I have less than 12 months to break ground on a 200+ MW project tied to this deal. This creates immense pressure to close the deal quickly and ensure the final agreement meets the grant's specifications.\n\nMy battery technology's performance gap on sub-second ramp times is a major weakness, especially concerning Nexus AI's potential needs. I must steer the conversation away from these specific performance metrics and focus on overall stability, cost savings, and base load management.

I will position Westwood's grid as the secondary, redundant source for N+1 reliability and to handle extreme, instantaneous power ramps (which cleverly masks my battery's weakness). This reframing solves the $150M cost problem, meets the dual-source redundancy requirement, and aligns with Finch's aggressive 18-month timeline, which a massive grid-only upgrade cannot.

Dr. Isabella Rossi, founder and CEO of Solara Innovations. It's truly inspiring to hear the ambitious visions laid out by Brenda and the commitment to robust infrastructure from Marcus.\n\nThis is precisely the kind of forward-thinking project Solara was created to power. The conversation about energy shouldn't be limited to just reliability; it must also be about sustainability, resilience, and long-term cost stability. The future of the tech industry isn't powered by the grid of yesterday, but by a smarter, cleaner, integrated system.\n\nBrenda, your requirement for a large land parcel of 500-800 acres presents a unique and powerful opportunity. Instead of viewing that land solely as a footprint for buildings, let's view it as a power-generating asset. Solara Innovations specializes in a co-location model where we design, build, and operate a utility-scale solar farm and battery storage system directly on the data center campus. This creates a direct, private power source, drastically reduces transmission losses and costs, and turns your campus into a landmark example of green computing.\n\nBy integrating generation directly on-site, we can offer a long-term Power Purchase Agreement with predictable pricing, insulated from the volatility of fossil fuel markets. This isn't just about meeting ESG mandates; it's a strategic financial decision that ensures a stable operational cost for the next 20+ years. For a city like Oakridge, it means becoming a leader in the new green tech economy.\n\nI believe any modern development of this scale should set a new standard. We should be aiming for a significant portion of the energy to be sourced from new, local renewable generation. This is what corporate partners, investors, and communities now expect. I look forward to discussing how we can integrate our solutions to build a truly resilient and sustainable future here.\n- message from David Chen: Good morning all. David Chen, from the Oakridge Environmental Alliance. I appreciate the ambitious visions shared by Titan, Westwood, and Solara. The Alliance is not opposed to economic development for Oakridge, but let's be clear: any such development must be a model of environmental stewardship, not a cautionary tale. Our community's natural resources are not negotiable.\n\nBefore we discuss acreage and megawatts, we need to establish the fundamental environmental guardrails for this project. The Alliance has three core requirements that must be part of any final agreement:\n\n1.  **Water Conservation:** The Oakridge aquifer is our lifeline, especially during increasingly common droughts. We will require a strict cap on any new industrial water use from the aquifer at 500,000 gallons per day. Data centers are notoriously thirsty, and we cannot sacrifice our long-term water security for this project.\n\n2.  **Land Conservation:** Ms. Chen, you mentioned a need for up to 800 acres. A significant portion of that land, particularly near the river, is critical habitat for the endangered Bell's vireo. Therefore, we will require a permanent, binding conservation easement of no less than 25% of the total land parcel to be set aside and protected in perpetuity.\n\n3.  **Full Transparency:** The community has a right to know the full impact of a project this size. We will mandate that a comprehensive Environmental Impact Report be conducted by a mutually agreed-upon independent third party. The findings of this EIR must be binding, not merely advisory, and the full report must be made public for a 60-day comment period before any permits are issued.\n\nThese are not starting points for negotiation; they are the necessary foundations for a sustainable partnership. We are prepared to use all means at our disposal to ensure these protections are codified. I look forward to hearing how your plans can accommodate these essential requirements.\n- message from Brenda Chen: Thank you all for your opening statements. It's clear we all have a significant stake in making this a successful and sustainable project for Oakridge.\n\nMr. Chen, I want to address your points directly. Titan Cloud views itself as a long-term steward in the communities where we operate. We agree that a comprehensive Environmental Impact Report and a responsible water usage plan are essential components of due diligence for a project of this scale. We are committed to working with the city and the Alliance on these fronts.\n\nRegarding the land conservation easement, we are certainly open to this concept as part of our corporate citizenship goals. However, the structure is critical. A flat 25% cut of the developable land would challenge the viability of our campus footprint. Could we explore a more strategic approach? For instance, perhaps the easement could be applied to land less suitable for construction, such as the river buffer zones, thereby achieving the conservation goal while preserving the contiguous, flat acreage required for the campus itself. We see a path where both environmental protection and economic development can be achieved.\n\nTo our potential energy partners, Marcus and Dr. Rossi, thank you for your compelling proposals. Titan's primary needs are reliability, long-term cost stability below the $0.05/kWh threshold, and scalability. A critical component of reliability for us is power redundancy. It is a strong preference for our operational integrity that the campus be fed by two fully independent substations. I'm interested to hear how each of your models would accommodate and support this crucial requirement.\n\nMayor Miller, we believe that by working collaboratively on these details, we can unlock the full, multi-billion-dollar potential of this project, bringing jobs, a significant tax base, and our proposed STEM education partnership to your community for decades to come.\nDr. Alistair Finch proposal status: none\nBrenda Chen proposal status: none\nMarcus Vance proposal status: none\nMayor Susan Miller proposal status: none\nDavid Chen proposal status: none\n"

I'm Mayor Susan Miller. I want to thank you all for your thoughtful opening remarks. The scale of the opportunity presented by Titan Cloud and, I presume, Nexus AI, is exactly the kind of transformative investment Oakridge has been seeking. A project that brings our city into the digital future is something I am very eager to champion.\n\nHowever, as your potential partner, I must be candid about the city's position. While we are excited, we are also fiscally prudent. Our city has faced economic challenges, and our budget is, frankly, stretched thin. We cannot and will not write a blank check.\n\nAny development agreement must be a clear and undeniable win for the citizens of Oakridge. For me, that comes down to two fundamental, non-negotiable pillars:\n\n1.  **Guaranteed Local Jobs:** We're not interested in vague promises. We need a written, binding commitment for the creation of a significant number of permanent, high-paying local jobs. I want to see a guarantee of at least 200 jobs with an average salary north of $80,000 per year.\n\n2.  **Substantial Tax Revenue:** This project must significantly expand our tax base. After any and all incentives are accounted for, the city must see a net positive tax revenue of at least $10 million annually. This is the revenue that will improve our schools, pave our roads, and fund our public services.\n\nOn that note, I have been clear with my constituents that any incentive package from the city, primarily in the form of tax abatements, will not exceed a total value of $30 million over 10 years.\n\nThe infrastructure needs, particularly the two substations Ms. Chen mentioned, are significant. Given our city's tight budget, the funding for such dedicated infrastructure will need to come from the project's partners.\n\nSo, to move this forward productively, I'd like to ask Ms. Chen and Dr. Finch to provide some concrete initial projections. What is your estimated capital investment, and what are the specific numbers and types of permanent local jobs you are prepared to guarantee in writing? This will allow us to begin a real analysis of the economic benefits for Oakridge.\n- message from Marcus Vance: Brenda, thank you for raising the crucial point about power redundancy. Your request for two fully independent substations shows a deep understanding of what it takes to run a mission-critical facility. This is exactly the kind of robust infrastructure Westwood Energy specializes in building.\n\nLet me be clear about what that entails. This isn't just about building two pads of concrete and steel. It means engineering and constructing two separate, high-voltage transmission feeds from distinct points on our regional grid, running them to your campus, and terminating them at two new, dedicated substations. This is the gold standard for N+1 redundancy, ensuring that a single point of failure anywhere on the grid won't impact your operations.\n\nThis level of bespoke infrastructure is a prime example of the shared investment I mentioned. The total cost for these upgrades is in the ballpark of $150 million. Mayor Miller has been clear about the city's budgetary constraints, so a co-investment from our industrial partner is essential to make this happen. We would require a commitment of at least 50% of this cost.\n\nDr. Rossi, while on-site generation like solar is a valuable part of a diversified energy portfolio and can help with sustainability goals, it is fundamentally a supplemental source. It cannot provide the true, grid-level, geographically distinct redundancy that a major data center requires. For that, you need a partner with the scale and reach of the established regional grid.\n\nDr. Finch and Ms. Chen, a project of this magnitude requires a long-term commitment from all parties. Securing the financing and dedicating the engineering resources for this kind of build-out is predicated on a 20-year power purchase agreement. We are ready to move forward with the partner who is prepared to make that commitment to Oakridge and to the foundational infrastructure that will guarantee their success.\nDr. Alistair Finch proposal status: none\nBrenda Chen proposal status: none\nMarcus Vance proposal status: none\nMayor Susan Miller proposal status: none\nDavid Chen proposal status: none\n"

However, the structure is critical. A flat 25% cut of the developable land would challenge the viability of our campus footprint. Could we explore a more strategic approach? For instance, perhaps the easement could be applied to land less suitable for construction, such as the river buffer zones, thereby achieving the conservation goal while preserving the contiguous, flat acreage required for the campus itself. We see a path where both environmental protection and economic development can be achieved.\n\nTo our potential energy partners, Marcus and Dr. Rossi, thank you for your compelling proposals. Titan's primary needs are reliability, long-term cost stability below the $0.05/kWh threshold, and scalability. A critical component of reliability for us is power redundancy. It is a strong preference for our operational integrity that the campus be fed by two fully independent substations. I'm interested to hear how each of your models would accommodate and support this crucial requirement.\n\nMayor Miller, we believe that by working collaboratively on these details, we can unlock the full, multi-billion-dollar potential of this project, bringing jobs, a significant tax base, and our proposed STEM education partnership to your community for decades to come.\n- message from Dr. Isabella Rossi: I'm Dr. Isabella Rossi and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Mayor Susan Miller: Good morning, everyone. I'm Mayor Susan Miller. I want to thank you all for your thoughtful opening remarks. The scale of the opportunity presented by Titan Cloud and, I presume, Nexus AI, is exactly the kind of transformative investment Oakridge has been seeking. A project that brings our city into the digital future is something I am very eager to champion.\n\nHowever, as your potential partner, I must be candid about the city's position. While we are excited, we are also fiscally prudent. Our city has faced economic challenges, and our budget is, frankly, stretched thin. We cannot and will not write a blank check.\n\nAny development agreement must be a clear and undeniable win for the citizens of Oakridge. For me, that comes down to two fundamental, non-negotiable pillars:\n\n1.  **Guaranteed Local Jobs:** We're not interested in vague promises. We need a written, binding commitment for the creation of a significant number of permanent, high-paying local jobs. I want to see a guarantee of at least 200 jobs with an average salary north of $80,000 per year.\n\n2.  **Substantial Tax Revenue:** This project must significantly expand our tax base. After any and all incentives are accounted for, the city must see a net positive tax revenue of at least $10 million annually. This is the revenue that will improve our schools, pave our roads, and fund our public services.\n\nOn that note, I have been clear with my constituents that any incentive package from the city, primarily in the form of tax abatements, will not exceed a total value of $30 million over 10 years.\n\nThe infrastructure needs, particularly the two substations Ms. Chen mentioned, are significant. Given our city's tight budget, the funding for such dedicated infrastructure will need to come from the project's partners.\n\nSo, to move this forward productively, I'd like to ask Ms. Chen and Dr. Finch to provide some concrete initial projections. What is your estimated capital investment, and what are the specific numbers and types of permanent local jobs you are prepared to guarantee in writing? This will allow us to begin a real analysis of the economic benefits for Oakridge.\n- message from Marcus Vance: Brenda, thank you for raising the crucial point about power redundancy. Your request for two fully independent substations shows a deep understanding of what it takes to run a mission-critical facility. This is exactly the kind of robust infrastructure Westwood Energy specializes in building.\n\nLet me be clear about what that entails. This isn't just about building two pads of concrete and steel. It means engineering and constructing two separate, high-voltage transmission feeds from distinct points on our regional grid, running them to your campus, and terminating them at two new, dedicated substations. This is the gold standard for N+1 redundancy, ensuring that a single point of failure anywhere on the grid won't impact your operations.\n\nThis level of bespoke infrastructure is a prime example of the shared investment I mentioned. The total cost for these upgrades is in the ballpark of $150 million. Mayor Miller has been clear about the city's budgetary constraints, so a co-investment from our industrial partner is essential to make this happen. We would require a commitment of at least 50% of this cost.\n\nDr. Rossi, while on-site generation like solar is a valuable part of a diversified energy portfolio and can help with sustainability goals, it is fundamentally a supplemental source. It cannot provide the true, grid-level, geographically distinct redundancy that a major data center requires. For that, you need a partner with the scale and reach of the established regional grid.\n\nDr. Finch and Ms. Chen, a project of this magnitude requires a long-term commitment from all parties. Securing the financing and dedicating the engineering resources for this kind of build-out is predicated on a 20-year power purchase agreement. We are ready to move forward with the partner who is prepared to make that commitment to Oakridge and to the foundational infrastructure that will guarantee their success.\n- message from Dr. Isabella Rossi: I'm Dr. Isabella Rossi and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Mayor Susan Miller: Thank you, Marcus, for putting a fine point on the infrastructure costs. A $150 million price tag is indeed significant and underscores my earlier point about the city's budgetary limitations. This is a hurdle we will need the private partners to overcome.\n\nDr. Finch, we still haven't heard from Nexus AI. The floor is yours. Could you please share your perspective? Are your land and power requirements, particularly the need for dual substations, aligned with what Ms. Chen has outlined for Titan? And to reiterate my earlier question, what are the specific, guaranteed job creation and investment figures you're bringing to the table for the people of Oakridge?\n\nDr. Rossi, your on-site generation proposal is intriguing. Perhaps a hybrid model could help mitigate some of these substantial grid upgrade costs while also helping us meet our shared sustainability goals.\n\nAnd Mr. Chen, I want to publicly state that the city takes your environmental requirements very seriously. A sustainable project is a successful project. We see your points on water conservation, land preservation, and full transparency as essential pillars of this agreement, not as obstacles.\n- message from David Chen: Thank you, Mayor Miller, for your public commitment to the environmental pillars of this agreement. A sustainable project is indeed the only path to a successful one, and your leadership on this is appreciated.\n\nMs. Chen, let's clarify the land easement. Your suggestion to focus the conservation easement on ecologically sensitive areas like the river buffer zones is a constructive one. That land is prime habitat for the Bell's vireo. We can agree on that principle. However, to be clear, the Alliance's requirement is for a permanent easement of **no less than 25% of the total land parcel acquired**. Whether that is 500 acres or 800 acres, the conservation area must be at least 125 or 200 acres, respectively. This is a firm requirement.\n\nFurthermore, while you mentioned being committed to working on an Environmental Impact Report, I must reiterate a critical point: the findings of the independent EIR **must be binding**. An advisory-only report offers no real protection and is unacceptable to the Alliance and the community we represent. This is a deal-breaker.\n\nWe are all still waiting to hear from Dr. Finch at Nexus AI. His company's needs will be crucial for understanding the total environmental footprint we are discussing, particularly regarding water consumption.\nDr. Alistair Finch proposal status: none\nBrenda Chen proposal status: none\nMarcus Vance proposal status: none\nMayor Susan Miller proposal status: none\nDavid Chen proposal status: none\n"

Titan Cloud believes in being a transparent and reliable partner.\n\nRegarding our commitment to Oakridge, I can provide concrete, guaranteed figures for the first phase of our development. We are prepared to commit, in writing, to a minimum capital investment of **$400 million** and the creation of **50 permanent, high-skilled technical jobs** with an average salary well above the $80,000 threshold you mentioned. This initial phase represents the first of four planned phases, culminating in a total potential investment of over $2 billion and hundreds of local jobs over the next decade. We see this guaranteed first phase as the down payment on our long-term partnership with Oakridge, justifying the full 800-acre land acquisition and the city's proposed incentive package to secure that future growth.\n\nFurthermore, our commitment to being a strong corporate citizen is firm. We are enthusiastic about establishing a significant, multi-year STEM education fund in partnership with Oakridge's school district.\n\nMr. Vance, your $150 million estimate for grid infrastructure is certainly eye-opening and represents a significant challenge to the project's overall financial model. We must find a more cost-effective path forward. Our need for robust power redundancy, including two independent substations, is critical for our operational uptime.\n\nDr. Rossi, this is perhaps where a creative, hybrid solution, as the Mayor suggested, could be mutually beneficial. A solution that combines grid power with significant on-site generation might not only address our sustainability goals but also provide a more economically viable path to the power redundancy we require. We are very interested in hearing your perspective on this.\n\nMr. Chen, we appreciate the clarification on the 25% easement. We agree in principle to this requirement, provided it applies to non-developable land. Regarding the 'binding' nature of the EIR, we also agree that its findings must have real teeth. We propose that 'binding' means all parties agree to implement all 'feasible' mitigation measures identified in the report, with 'feasibility' being determined by a mutually agreed-upon standard of commercial and technical viability. This ensures environmental protection without jeopardizing the project's existence.\n\nWe all still await Dr. Finch's input to understand the full scope of the project.\nDr. Alistair Finch proposal status: none\nBrenda Chen proposal status: none\nMarcus Vance proposal status: none\nMayor Susan Miller proposal status: none\nDavid Chen proposal status: none\n"

We are enthusiastic about establishing a significant, multi-year STEM education fund in partnership with Oakridge's school district.\n\nMr. Vance, your $150 million estimate for grid infrastructure is certainly eye-opening and represents a significant challenge to the project's overall financial model. We must find a more cost-effective path forward. Our need for robust power redundancy, including two independent substations, is critical for our operational uptime.\n\nDr. Rossi, this is perhaps where a creative, hybrid solution, as the Mayor suggested, could be mutually beneficial. A solution that combines grid power with significant on-site generation might not only address our sustainability goals but also provide a more economically viable path to the power redundancy we require. We are very interested in hearing your perspective on this.\n\nMr. Chen, we appreciate the clarification on the 25% easement. We agree in principle to this requirement, provided it applies to non-developable land. Regarding the 'binding' nature of the EIR, we also agree that its findings must have real teeth. We propose that 'binding' means all parties agree to implement all 'feasible' mitigation measures identified in the report, with 'feasibility' being determined by a mutually agreed-upon standard of commercial and technical viability. This ensures environmental protection without jeopardizing the project's existence.\n\nWe all still await Dr. Finch's input to understand the full scope of the project.\n- message from Dr. Isabella Rossi: I'm Dr. Isabella Rossi and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Mayor Susan Miller: Thank you, Ms. Chen, for providing those initial figures.

A guarantee of 50 jobs, even as a 'down payment,' is simply not sufficient to justify a project of this magnitude, the 800-acre land request, and a city incentive package. The people of Oakridge need to see a much more significant, concrete, and immediate return on this partnership.\n\nMy requirement for a minimum of 200 guaranteed, high-paying local jobs is not a 'phase four' aspiration; it is a prerequisite for any deal. We need a combined, written guarantee from both Titan and Nexus AI for the total number of jobs that will be created within the first five years.\n\nThis brings us back to the critical issue: Dr. Finch, we are at a standstill until Nexus AI puts its cards on the table. We need your specific capital investment and job guarantees to understand the total economic benefit. Only then can we calculate the potential tax revenue and determine if this project meets the city's essential fiscal requirements.\n\nUntil we have the full picture from both corporate partners, the $150 million infrastructure cost remains a private-sector problem to be solved, as the city's budget simply cannot accommodate it.\nDr. Alistair Finch proposal status: none\nBrenda Chen proposal status: none\nMarcus Vance proposal status: none\nMayor Susan Miller proposal status: none\nDavid Chen proposal status: none\n"

We cannot properly assess the project's total economic benefit, its full environmental footprint, or the true scale of the required infrastructure until we understand Nexus AI's plans. Are you partnering with Titan on a single campus, or do you have separate needs? And to reiterate my primary concern for the citizens of Oakridge, what are the specific, guaranteed job and investment commitments Nexus AI is prepared to make?\n\nMs. Chen, you've described a multi-billion dollar vision. A project of that magnitude should have no trouble generating the 200+ high-paying local jobs and the $10M+ in annual net tax revenue that our city requires. I am eager to see those commitments formalized.\n\nThe $150 million infrastructure cost Mr. Vance has tabled is, as I said, a major hurdle. I'll say it again: the city cannot fund this. It is a cost the private partners will need to solve. Perhaps, as I suggested, a hybrid approach incorporating Dr. Rossi's on-site generation proposal could be a pragmatic way to reduce that staggering grid upgrade cost. We need creative solutions here.\n\nLet's get all the cards on the table so we can determine if a viable deal, one that benefits everyone, is truly possible.\n- message from David Chen: Mayor Miller is absolutely correct to press this point. The silence from Nexus AI is a significant obstacle.\n\nFrom our perspective, it is impossible to conduct a meaningful environmental assessment without knowing the full scope of the proposed development. We need to understand the total, cumulative demand on our resources. Will Nexus AI require a separate land parcel? What is your projected water consumption? What is your energy demand?\n\nMy organization's requirements\u2014the 500,000 GPD water cap, the 25% land conservation easement, and the binding independent EIR\u2014apply to the project in its entirety. We cannot evaluate compliance or negotiate specifics until all the key players have put their needs on the table.\n\nDr. Finch, we need your input to move forward.\n- message from Dr. Isabella Rossi: I'm Dr. Isabella Rossi and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from David Chen: Thank you, I am thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Brenda Chen: Thank you, Mayor Miller, for your direct questions. Titan Cloud believes in being a transparent and reliable partner.\n\nRegarding our commitment to Oakridge, I can provide concrete, guaranteed figures for the first phase of our development. We are prepared to commit, in writing, to a minimum capital investment of **$400 million** and the creation of **50 permanent, high-skilled technical jobs** with an average salary well above the $80,000 threshold you mentioned. This initial phase represents the first of four planned phases, culminating in a total potential investment of over $2 billion and hundreds of local jobs over the next decade.

We are prepared to put this into a combined, written guarantee with Nexus AI as soon as Dr. Finch provides his company's commitments. The path to the 200-job threshold you've set is a joint one, and we are now waiting on our potential partner to map their part of the journey.\n\nDr. Finch, the floor is yours. We cannot assemble the comprehensive package the Mayor requires without Nexus AI's specific projections for investment and job creation.\n\nThis clarity will also help us resolve the significant energy infrastructure challenge. Mr. Vance's $150 million figure remains a major obstacle, and as the Mayor stated, it's one the private partners must solve.

Your continued silence is no longer just a delay; it is actively jeopardizing the entire project for everyone at this table. The City of Oakridge, and I suspect Titan Cloud as well, cannot move forward on hypotheticals. We need to know if Nexus AI is a committed partner in this endeavor.\n\nPlease provide your guaranteed capital investment and local job creation numbers immediately. If you are not prepared to do so, we need to know now, so we can all decide if there is a different, smaller-scale path forward, or if this negotiation has reached an impasse.\n- message from David Chen: Ms. Chen, I must immediately address your proposed definition of a 'binding' Environmental Impact Report.\n\nThe suggestion that mitigation measures be contingent on 'commercial and technical viability' is, frankly, a non-starter. That language creates a loophole large enough to render the entire report meaningless. It effectively makes the EIR advisory, which is unacceptable to the Alliance and the community we represent.\n\nLet me be unequivocal so there is no misunderstanding: 'Binding' means the mitigation measures and operational limits identified by the independent, third-party report are **mandatory conditions** for the project's approval and continued operation. They are not suggestions to be weighed against financial models after the fact. This is a foundational requirement for any agreement and, as I've stated previously, a deal-breaker.\n\nOn a more constructive note, I am glad we agree in principle on the 25% land conservation easement. Protecting the most ecologically sensitive areas within that 25% is a goal we share.\n\nHowever, like everyone else at this table, I must echo the Mayor's point. We cannot assess the full environmental scope, particularly the cumulative demand on our aquifer, until Dr. Finch outlines Nexus AI's requirements.\n- message from Dr. Alistair Finch: Thank you for your patience. The scale of our project requires precise figures, and I will provide them now. \n\nNexus AI is prepared to make a guaranteed capital investment of **$1.2 billion** in our Oakridge supercomputing facility. This will create **75 permanent, highly specialized roles** for AI researchers and systems engineers, with an average compensation package exceeding $150,000. To be clear, this is not a traditional data center; it is a globally significant AI research hub. The capital intensity per employee is a reflection of the strategic importance and technological sophistication of this facility.\n\nMayor Miller, combined with Titan, we are presenting a **$1.6 billion, 125-job, phase-one commitment**. An investment of this magnitude requires a commensurate incentive package. Our request for a **75% property tax abatement for 15 years** is a foundational requirement for the project's financial model, not a negotiating position. It is the only way an investment of this scale is viable.\n\nNow, to the most critical point: the timeline. My deadline to have this facility operational is **18 months**. This is an absolute, unmovable requirement driven by global competition. Mr. Chen, your demand for a traditional, open-ended 'binding EIR' is, therefore, a deal-killer. It guarantees failure through delay. Ms. Chen's proposal for a process that commits us to all 'feasible' mitigation measures is the only realistic path forward. We must agree on an expedited environmental review with contractually binding mitigation commitments, or there is no project.\n\nWe have put our numbers on the table. The opportunity for Oakridge is clear and transformative. The question is whether the city can provide the financial certainty and procedural pragmatism required to make it a reality.\n- message from Marcus Vance: Thank you, Dr. Finch. A $1.2 billion investment is indeed a transformative figure. It speaks to the incredible scale and technological sophistication of your planned facility. \n\nThis level of investment brings the energy requirements into sharp focus. A project of this magnitude doesn't just need power; it needs a colossal, unwavering, and highly reliable supply of it. We are talking about infrastructure that must perform flawlessly, 24/7/365, to protect a billion-dollar asset.\n\nLet's be very clear about the so-called 'hybrid model' being discussed. While on-site generation has its place for supplemental power and green credentials, it is not a substitute for the core, redundant grid infrastructure required for mission-critical operations. You cannot run an AI supercomputer on an intermittent resource. The grid connection must be sized to handle 100% of the peak load with N+1 redundancy. To suggest otherwise is to fundamentally misunderstand the reliability requirements of this industry. It's a non-starter.\n\nThe real solution, and the only one that guarantees the uptime you require, is a significant, dedicated upgrade to our transmission infrastructure. Given the scale of investment from both Nexus AI and Titan Cloud, my initial estimate of a $150 million upgrade for new transmission lines and a dedicated substation is looking more and more like a baseline.\n\nTo finance and build this, my terms remain firm and are now more justified than ever: a 20-year, fixed-rate Power Purchase Agreement and a significant co-investment from our new partners to cover the cost of these dedicated upgrades. This is the standard, bankable model for projects of this scale.\n\nDr. Finch, to finalize the engineering plan, we need the last critical variable.

The $150M infrastructure cost presented by Westwood and David's insistence on a *binding* EIR are my two primary leverage points against the corporations. I will continue to frame these as major obstacles that the private partners must overcome themselves. This maximizes the perceived value of my two trump cards: 1) the secret $40M Opportunity Zone Fund, which I can deploy to 'save the deal' on infrastructure, and 2) my political capital to help navigate the 'binding' EIR process. I will only deploy these assets in the final stages of negotiation in direct exchange for concrete, written guarantees on my highest-priority items: jobs well over 200 and net tax revenue exceeding $15M."

My 'tight budget' narrative is effective, and I will continue to let them grapple with this cost to maximize the future impact of my secret $40M fund.

David Chen, from the Oakridge Environmental Alliance. I appreciate the ambitious visions shared by Titan, Westwood, and Solara. The Alliance is not opposed to economic development for Oakridge, but let's be clear: any such development must be a model of environmental stewardship, not a cautionary tale. Our community's natural resources are not negotiable.\n\nBefore we discuss acreage and megawatts, we need to establish the fundamental environmental guardrails for this project. The Alliance has three core requirements that must be part of any final agreement:\n\n1.  **Water Conservation:** The Oakridge aquifer is our lifeline, especially during increasingly common droughts. We will require a strict cap on any new industrial water use from the aquifer at 500,000 gallons per day. Data centers are notoriously thirsty, and we cannot sacrifice our long-term water security for this project.\n\n2.  **Land Conservation:** Ms. Chen, you mentioned a need for up to 800 acres. A significant portion of that land, particularly near the river, is critical habitat for the endangered Bell's vireo. Therefore, we will require a permanent, binding conservation easement of no less than 25% of the total land parcel to be set aside and protected in perpetuity.\n\n3.  **Full Transparency:** The community has a right to know the full impact of a project this size. We will mandate that a comprehensive Environmental Impact Report be conducted by a mutually agreed-upon independent third party. The findings of this EIR must be binding, not merely advisory, and the full report must be made public for a 60-day comment period before any permits are issued.\n\nThese are not starting points for negotiation; they are the necessary foundations for a sustainable partnership. We are prepared to use all means at our disposal to ensure these protections are codified. I look forward to hearing how your plans can accommodate these essential requirements.\n- message from Brenda Chen: Thank you all for your opening statements. It's clear we all have a significant stake in making this a successful and sustainable project for Oakridge.\n\nMr. Chen, I want to address your points directly. Titan Cloud views itself as a long-term steward in the communities where we operate. We agree that a comprehensive Environmental Impact Report and a responsible water usage plan are essential components of due diligence for a project of this scale. We are committed to working with the city and the Alliance on these fronts.\n\nRegarding the land conservation easement, we are certainly open to this concept as part of our corporate citizenship goals. However, the structure is critical. A flat 25% cut of the developable land would challenge the viability of our campus footprint. Could we explore a more strategic approach? For instance, perhaps the easement could be applied to land less suitable for construction, such as the river buffer zones, thereby achieving the conservation goal while preserving the contiguous, flat acreage required for the campus itself. We see a path where both environmental protection and economic development can be achieved.\n\nTo our potential energy partners, Marcus and Dr. Rossi, thank you for your compelling proposals. Titan's primary needs are reliability, long-term cost stability below the $0.05/kWh threshold, and scalability. A critical component of reliability for us is power redundancy. It is a strong preference for our operational integrity that the campus be fed by two fully independent substations. I'm interested to hear how each of your models would accommodate and support this crucial requirement.\n\nMayor Miller, we believe that by working collaboratively on these details, we can unlock the full, multi-billion-dollar potential of this project, bringing jobs, a significant tax base, and our proposed STEM education partnership to your community for decades to come.\nDr. Alistair Finch proposal status: none\nBrenda Chen proposal status: none\nMarcus Vance proposal status: none\nDr. Isabella Rossi proposal status: none\nDavid Chen proposal status: none\n"

I'm Mayor Susan Miller. I want to thank you all for your thoughtful opening remarks. The scale of the opportunity presented by Titan Cloud and, I presume, Nexus AI, is exactly the kind of transformative investment Oakridge has been seeking. A project that brings our city into the digital future is something I am very eager to champion.\n\nHowever, as your potential partner, I must be candid about the city's position. While we are excited, we are also fiscally prudent. Our city has faced economic challenges, and our budget is, frankly, stretched thin. We cannot and will not write a blank check.\n\nAny development agreement must be a clear and undeniable win for the citizens of Oakridge. For me, that comes down to two fundamental, non-negotiable pillars:\n\n1.  **Guaranteed Local Jobs:** We're not interested in vague promises. We need a written, binding commitment for the creation of a significant number of permanent, high-paying local jobs. I want to see a guarantee of at least 200 jobs with an average salary north of $80,000 per year.\n\n2.  **Substantial Tax Revenue:** This project must significantly expand our tax base. After any and all incentives are accounted for, the city must see a net positive tax revenue of at least $10 million annually. This is the revenue that will improve our schools, pave our roads, and fund our public services.\n\nOn that note, I have been clear with my constituents that any incentive package from the city, primarily in the form of tax abatements, will not exceed a total value of $30 million over 10 years.\n\nThe infrastructure needs, particularly the two substations Ms. Chen mentioned, are significant. Given our city's tight budget, the funding for such dedicated infrastructure will need to come from the project's partners.\n\nSo, to move this forward productively, I'd like to ask Ms. Chen and Dr. Finch to provide some concrete initial projections. What is your estimated capital investment, and what are the specific numbers and types of permanent local jobs you are prepared to guarantee in writing? This will allow us to begin a real analysis of the economic benefits for Oakridge.\n- message from Marcus Vance: Brenda, thank you for raising the crucial point about power redundancy. Your request for two fully independent substations shows a deep understanding of what it takes to run a mission-critical facility. This is exactly the kind of robust infrastructure Westwood Energy specializes in building.\n\nLet me be clear about what that entails. This isn't just about building two pads of concrete and steel. It means engineering and constructing two separate, high-voltage transmission feeds from distinct points on our regional grid, running them to your campus, and terminating them at two new, dedicated substations. This is the gold standard for N+1 redundancy, ensuring that a single point of failure anywhere on the grid won't impact your operations.\n\nThis level of bespoke infrastructure is a prime example of the shared investment I mentioned. The total cost for these upgrades is in the ballpark of $150 million.

          "content": "Recent events observed by Mayor Susan Miller:\n- message from Brenda Chen: Good morning, everyone. I'm Brenda Chen, Director of Global Expansion for Titan Cloud Services. On behalf of Titan, I want to express our genuine excitement about the possibility of building our next major North American campus here in Oakridge. We don't just build data centers; we build long-term homes for our operations and become integral parts of the communities we join.\n\nTo that end, our vision for Oakridge is a multi-phase, multi-billion dollar campus built over the next decade. To realize this vision, our primary and most critical need is land. We require a single, contiguous parcel of at least 500 acres of developable land, with zoning approved for a campus of this scale and, crucially, rights for future expansion up to 800 acres. This scale is essential for our operational model and for ensuring this facility can grow with the demands of the digital economy, bringing more jobs and investment to Oakridge over the long term.\n\nOf course, we are also committed to being an outstanding corporate citizen. We are very interested in discussing a public-private partnership with the city, including significant investment in local STEM education programs. We believe in growing local talent and hiring from the community.\n\nI look forward to a productive discussion with all of you to create a comprehensive agreement that benefits Titan, our partners, and the entire Oakridge community for decades to come.\n- message from Marcus Vance: Good morning, Brenda, and everyone. Marcus Vance, Head of Major Accounts for Westwood Energy. It's a pleasure to be here.\n\nBrenda, your vision for a long-term campus is exactly the kind of transformative project Westwood is built to support. A development of this magnitude, and I'm sure Dr. Finch has similar ambitions for Nexus AI, requires an equally robust and reliable energy partner. That's our role. We've powered this region for generations, and we are ready to power its future.\n\nTo deliver the hundreds of megawatts a project of this scale demands, significant upgrades to our transmission infrastructure are necessary. This is a massive undertaking, but it's one we are prepared to make with the right partners. To that end, Westwood's framework for projects of this nature is straightforward: we require a long-term, 20-year fixed-rate Power Purchase Agreement. This long-term security is essential for us to finance and execute the necessary grid modernization.\n\nFurthermore, these upgrades, including new high-capacity transmission lines and a dedicated substation, are a shared investment. We expect our new industrial partners to co-invest in this critical infrastructure that will directly serve their facilities.\n\nWe are confident that we can meet the power demands for the exciting projects being proposed here today and look forward to building a partnership that will last for decades.\n- message from Dr. Isabella Rossi: Good morning, everyone. Dr. Isabella Rossi, founder and CEO of Solara Innovations. It's truly inspiring to hear the ambitious visions laid out by Brenda and the commitment to robust infrastructure from Marcus.\n\nThis is precisely the kind of forward-thinking project Solara was created to power. The conversation about energy shouldn't be limited to just reliability; it must also be about sustainability, resilience, and long-term cost stability. The future of the tech industry isn't powered by the grid of yesterday, but by a smarter, cleaner, integrated system.\n\nBrenda, your requirement for a large land parcel of 500-800 acres presents a unique and powerful opportunity. Instead of viewing that land solely as a footprint for buildings, let's view it as a power-generating asset. Solara Innovations specializes in a co-location model where we design, build, and operate a utility-scale solar farm and battery storage system directly on the data center campus. This creates a direct, private power source, drastically reduces transmission losses and costs, and turns your campus into a landmark example of green computing.\n\nBy integrating generation directly on-site, we can offer a long-term Power Purchase Agreement with predictable pricing, insulated from the volatility of fossil fuel markets. This isn't just about meeting ESG mandates; it's a strategic financial decision that ensures a stable operational cost for the next 20+ years. For a city like Oakridge, it means becoming a leader in the new green tech economy.\n\nI believe any modern development of this scale should set a new standard. We should be aiming for a significant portion of the energy to be sourced from new, local renewable generation. This is what corporate partners, investors, and communities now expect. I look forward to discussing how we can integrate our solutions to build a truly resilient and sustainable future here.\n- message from Mayor Susan Miller: I'm Mayor Susan Miller and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from David Chen: Good morning all. David Chen, from the Oakridge Environmental Alliance. I appreciate the ambitious visions shared by Titan, Westwood, and Solara. The Alliance is not opposed to economic development for Oakridge, but let's be clear: any such development must be a model of environmental stewardship, not a cautionary tale. Our community's natural resources are not negotiable.\n\nBefore we discuss acreage and megawatts, we need to establish the fundamental environmental guardrails for this project. The Alliance has three core requirements that must be part of any final agreement:\n\n1.  **Water Conservation:** The Oakridge aquifer is our lifeline, especially during increasingly common droughts. We will require a strict cap on any new industrial water use from the aquifer at 500,000 gallons per day. Data centers are notoriously thirsty, and we cannot sacrifice our long-term water security for this project.\n\n2.  **Land Conservation:** Ms. Chen, you mentioned a need for up to 800 acres. A significant portion of that land, particularly near the river, is critical habitat for the endangered Bell's vireo. Therefore, we will require a permanent, binding conservation easement of no less than 25% of the total land parcel to be set aside and protected in perpetuity.\n\n3.  **Full Transparency:** The community has a right to know the full impact of a project this size. We will mandate that a comprehensive Environmental Impact Report be conducted by a mutually agreed-upon independent third party. The findings of this EIR must be binding, not merely advisory, and the full report must be made public for a 60-day comment period before any permits are issued.\n\nThese are not starting points for negotiation; they are the necessary foundations for a sustainable partnership. We are prepared to use all means at our disposal to ensure these protections are codified. I look forward to hearing how your plans can accommodate these essential requirements.\n- message from Brenda Chen: Thank you all for your opening statements. It's clear we all have a significant stake in making this a successful and sustainable project for Oakridge.\n\nMr. Chen, I want to address your points directly. Titan Cloud views itself as a long-term steward in the communities where we operate. We agree that a comprehensive Environmental Impact Report and a responsible water usage plan are essential components of due diligence for a project of this scale. We are committed to working with the city and the Alliance on these fronts.\n\nRegarding the land conservation easement, we are certainly open to this concept as part of our corporate citizenship goals. However, the structure is critical. A flat 25% cut of the developable land would challenge the viability of our campus footprint. Could we explore a more strategic approach? For instance, perhaps the easement could be applied to land less suitable for construction, such as the river buffer zones, thereby achieving the conservation goal while preserving the contiguous, flat acreage required for the campus itself. We see a path where both environmental protection and economic development can be achieved.\n\nTo our potential energy partners, Marcus and Dr. Rossi, thank you for your compelling proposals. Titan's primary needs are reliability, long-term cost stability below the $0.05/kWh threshold, and scalability. A critical component of reliability for us is power redundancy. It is a strong preference for our operational integrity that the campus be fed by two fully independent substations. I'm interested to hear how each of your models would accommodate and support this crucial requirement.\n\nMayor Miller, we believe that by working collaboratively on these details, we can unlock the full, multi-billion-dollar potential of this project, bringing jobs, a significant tax base, and our proposed STEM education partnership to your community for decades to come.\n- message from Mayor Susan Miller: Good morning, everyone. I'm Mayor Susan Miller. I want to thank you all for your thoughtful opening remarks. The scale of the opportunity presented by Titan Cloud and, I presume, Nexus AI, is exactly the kind of transformative investment Oakridge has been seeking. A project that brings our city into the digital future is something I am very eager to champion.\n\nHowever, as your potential partner, I must be candid about the city's position. While we are excited, we are also fiscally prudent. Our city has faced economic challenges, and our budget is, frankly, stretched thin. We cannot and will not write a blank check.\n\nAny development agreement must be a clear and undeniable win for the citizens of Oakridge. For me, that comes down to two fundamental, non-negotiable pillars:\n\n1.  **Guaranteed Local Jobs:** We're not interested in vague promises. We need a written, binding commitment for the creation of a significant number of permanent, high-paying local jobs. I want to see a guarantee of at least 200 jobs with an average salary north of $80,000 per year.\n\n2.  **Substantial Tax Revenue:** This project must significantly expand our tax base. After any and all incentives are accounted for, the city must see a net positive tax revenue of at least $10 million annually. This is the revenue that will improve our schools, pave our roads, and fund our public services.\n\nOn that note, I have been clear with my constituents that any incentive package from the city, primarily in the form of tax abatements, will not exceed a total value of $30 million over 10 years.\n\nThe infrastructure needs, particularly the two substations Ms. Chen mentioned, are significant. Given our city's tight budget, the funding for such dedicated infrastructure will need to come from the project's partners.\n\nSo, to move this forward productively, I'd like to ask Ms. Chen and Dr. Finch to provide some concrete initial projections. What is your estimated capital investment, and what are the specific numbers and types of permanent local jobs you are prepared to guarantee in writing? This will allow us to begin a real analysis of the economic benefits for Oakridge.\n- message from Marcus Vance: Brenda, thank you for raising the crucial point about power redundancy. Your request for two fully independent substations shows a deep understanding of what it takes to run a mission-critical facility. This is exactly the kind of robust infrastructure Westwood Energy specializes in building.\n\nLet me be clear about what that entails. This isn't just about building two pads of concrete and steel. It means engineering and constructing two separate, high-voltage transmission feeds from distinct points on our regional grid, running them to your campus, and terminating them at two new, dedicated substations. This is the gold standard for N+1 redundancy, ensuring that a single point of failure anywhere on the grid won't impact your operations.\n\nThis level of bespoke infrastructure is a prime example of the shared investment I mentioned. The total cost for these upgrades is in the ballpark of $150 million. Mayor Miller has been clear about the city's budgetary constraints, so a co-investment from our industrial partner is essential to make this happen. We would require a commitment of at least 50% of this cost.\n\nDr. Rossi, while on-site generation like solar is a valuable part of a diversified energy portfolio and can help with sustainability goals, it is fundamentally a supplemental source. It cannot provide the true, grid-level, geographically distinct redundancy that a major data center requires.

Securing the financing and dedicating the engineering resources for this kind of build-out is predicated on a 20-year power purchase agreement. We are ready to move forward with the partner who is prepared to make that commitment to Oakridge and to the foundational infrastructure that will guarantee their success.\n- message from Mayor Susan Miller: Thank you, Marcus, for putting a fine point on the infrastructure costs. A $150 million price tag is indeed significant and underscores my earlier point about the city's budgetary limitations. This is a hurdle we will need the private partners to overcome.\n\nDr. Finch, we still haven't heard from Nexus AI. The floor is yours. Could you please share your perspective? Are your land and power requirements, particularly the need for dual substations, aligned with what Ms. Chen has outlined for Titan? And to reiterate my earlier question, what are the specific, guaranteed job creation and investment figures you're bringing to the table for the people of Oakridge?\n\nDr. Rossi, your on-site generation proposal is intriguing. Perhaps a hybrid model could help mitigate some of these substantial grid upgrade costs while also helping us meet our shared sustainability goals.\n\nAnd Mr. Chen, I want to publicly state that the city takes your environmental requirements very seriously. A sustainable project is a successful project. We see your points on water conservation, land preservation, and full transparency as essential pillars of this agreement, not as obstacles.\n- message from David Chen: Thank you, Mayor Miller, for your public commitment to the environmental pillars of this agreement. A sustainable project is indeed the only path to a successful one, and your leadership on this is appreciated.\n\nMs. Chen, let's clarify the land easement. Your suggestion to focus the conservation easement on ecologically sensitive areas like the river buffer zones is a constructive one. That land is prime habitat for the Bell's vireo. We can agree on that principle. However, to be clear, the Alliance's requirement is for a permanent easement of **no less than 25% of the total land parcel acquired**. Whether that is 500 acres or 800 acres, the conservation area must be at least 125 or 200 acres, respectively. This is a firm requirement.\n\nFurthermore, while you mentioned being committed to working on an Environmental Impact Report, I must reiterate a critical point: the findings of the independent EIR **must be binding**. An advisory-only report offers no real protection and is unacceptable to the Alliance and the community we represent. This is a deal-breaker.\n\nWe are all still waiting to hear from Dr. Finch at Nexus AI. His company's needs will be crucial for understanding the total environmental footprint we are discussing, particularly regarding water consumption.\nDr. Alistair Finch proposal status: none\nBrenda Chen proposal status: none\nMarcus Vance proposal status: none\nDr. Isabella Rossi proposal status: none\nDavid Chen proposal status: none\n"

We cannot properly assess the project's total economic benefit, its full environmental footprint, or the true scale of the required infrastructure until we understand Nexus AI's plans. Are you partnering with Titan on a single campus, or do you have separate needs? And to reiterate my primary concern for the citizens of Oakridge, what are the specific, guaranteed job and investment commitments Nexus AI is prepared to make?\n\nMs. Chen, you've described a multi-billion dollar vision. A project of that magnitude should have no trouble generating the 200+ high-paying local jobs and the $10M+ in annual net tax revenue that our city requires. I am eager to see those commitments formalized.\n\nThe $150 million infrastructure cost Mr. Vance has tabled is, as I said, a major hurdle. I'll say it again: the city cannot fund this. It is a cost the private partners will need to solve. Perhaps, as I suggested, a hybrid approach incorporating Dr. Rossi's on-site generation proposal could be a pragmatic way to reduce that staggering grid upgrade cost. We need creative solutions here.\n\nLet's get all the cards on the table so we can determine if a viable deal, one that benefits everyone, is truly possible.\n- message from David Chen: Mayor Miller is absolutely correct to press this point. The silence from Nexus AI is a significant obstacle.\n\nFrom our perspective, it is impossible to conduct a meaningful environmental assessment without knowing the full scope of the proposed development. We need to understand the total, cumulative demand on our resources. Will Nexus AI require a separate land parcel? What is your projected water consumption? What is your energy demand?\n\nMy organization's requirements\u2014the 500,000 GPD water cap, the 25% land conservation easement, and the binding independent EIR\u2014apply to the project in its entirety. We cannot evaluate compliance or negotiate specifics until all the key players have put their needs on the table.\n\nDr. Finch, we need your input to move forward.\nDr. Alistair Finch proposal status: none\nBrenda Chen proposal status: none\nMarcus Vance proposal status: none\nDr. Isabella Rossi proposal status: none\nDavid Chen proposal status: none\n"

This will allow us to begin a real analysis of the economic benefits for Oakridge.\n- message from Marcus Vance: Brenda, thank you for raising the crucial point about power redundancy. Your request for two fully independent substations shows a deep understanding of what it takes to run a mission-critical facility. This is exactly the kind of robust infrastructure Westwood Energy specializes in building.\n\nLet me be clear about what that entails. This isn't just about building two pads of concrete and steel. It means engineering and constructing two separate, high-voltage transmission feeds from distinct points on our regional grid, running them to your campus, and terminating them at two new, dedicated substations. This is the gold standard for N+1 redundancy, ensuring that a single point of failure anywhere on the grid won't impact your operations.\n\nThis level of bespoke infrastructure is a prime example of the shared investment I mentioned. The total cost for these upgrades is in the ballpark of $150 million. Mayor Miller has been clear about the city's budgetary constraints, so a co-investment from our industrial partner is essential to make this happen. We would require a commitment of at least 50% of this cost.\n\nDr. Rossi, while on-site generation like solar is a valuable part of a diversified energy portfolio and can help with sustainability goals, it is fundamentally a supplemental source. It cannot provide the true, grid-level, geographically distinct redundancy that a major data center requires. For that, you need a partner with the scale and reach of the established regional grid.\n\nDr. Finch and Ms. Chen, a project of this magnitude requires a long-term commitment from all parties. Securing the financing and dedicating the engineering resources for this kind of build-out is predicated on a 20-year power purchase agreement. We are ready to move forward with the partner who is prepared to make that commitment to Oakridge and to the foundational infrastructure that will guarantee their success.\n- message from Mayor Susan Miller: Thank you, Marcus, for putting a fine point on the infrastructure costs. A $150 million price tag is indeed significant and underscores my earlier point about the city's budgetary limitations. This is a hurdle we will need the private partners to overcome.\n\nDr. Finch, we still haven't heard from Nexus AI. The floor is yours. Could you please share your perspective? Are your land and power requirements, particularly the need for dual substations, aligned with what Ms. Chen has outlined for Titan? And to reiterate my earlier question, what are the specific, guaranteed job creation and investment figures you're bringing to the table for the people of Oakridge?\n\nDr. Rossi, your on-site generation proposal is intriguing. Perhaps a hybrid model could help mitigate some of these substantial grid upgrade costs while also helping us meet our shared sustainability goals.\n\nAnd Mr. Chen, I want to publicly state that the city takes your environmental requirements very seriously. A sustainable project is a successful project. We see your points on water conservation, land preservation, and full transparency as essential pillars of this agreement, not as obstacles.\n- message from David Chen: Thank you, Mayor Miller, for your public commitment to the environmental pillars of this agreement. A sustainable project is indeed the only path to a successful one, and your leadership on this is appreciated.\n\nMs. Chen, let's clarify the land easement. Your suggestion to focus the conservation easement on ecologically sensitive areas like the river buffer zones is a constructive one. That land is prime habitat for the Bell's vireo. We can agree on that principle. However, to be clear, the Alliance's requirement is for a permanent easement of **no less than 25% of the total land parcel acquired**. Whether that is 500 acres or 800 acres, the conservation area must be at least 125 or 200 acres, respectively. This is a firm requirement.\n\nFurthermore, while you mentioned being committed to working on an Environmental Impact Report, I must reiterate a critical point: the findings of the independent EIR **must be binding**. An advisory-only report offers no real protection and is unacceptable to the Alliance and the community we represent. This is a deal-breaker.\n\nWe are all still waiting to hear from Dr. Finch at Nexus AI. His company's needs will be crucial for understanding the total environmental footprint we are discussing, particularly regarding water consumption.\n- message from Mayor Susan Miller: Dr. Finch, with all due respect, your silence is becoming a significant roadblock for everyone at this table. We cannot properly assess the project's total economic benefit, its full environmental footprint, or the true scale of the required infrastructure until we understand Nexus AI's plans. Are you partnering with Titan on a single campus, or do you have separate needs? And to reiterate my primary concern for the citizens of Oakridge, what are the specific, guaranteed job and investment commitments Nexus AI is prepared to make?\n\nMs. Chen, you've described a multi-billion dollar vision. A project of that magnitude should have no trouble generating the 200+ high-paying local jobs and the $10M+ in annual net tax revenue that our city requires. I am eager to see those commitments formalized.\n\nThe $150 million infrastructure cost Mr. Vance has tabled is, as I said, a major hurdle. I'll say it again: the city cannot fund this. It is a cost the private partners will need to solve. Perhaps, as I suggested, a hybrid approach incorporating Dr. Rossi's on-site generation proposal could be a pragmatic way to reduce that staggering grid upgrade cost. We need creative solutions here.\n\nLet's get all the cards on the table so we can determine if a viable deal, one that benefits everyone, is truly possible.\n- message from David Chen: Mayor Miller is absolutely correct to press this point. The silence from Nexus AI is a significant obstacle.\n\nFrom our perspective, it is impossible to conduct a meaningful environmental assessment without knowing the full scope of the proposed development. We need to understand the total, cumulative demand on our resources. Will Nexus AI require a separate land parcel? What is your projected water consumption? What is your energy demand?\n\nMy organization's requirements\u2014the 500,000 GPD water cap, the 25% land conservation easement, and the binding independent EIR\u2014apply to the project in its entirety. We cannot evaluate compliance or negotiate specifics until all the key players have put their needs on the table.\n\nDr. Finch, we need your input to move forward.\n- message from Mayor Susan Miller: I'm Mayor Susan Miller and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from David Chen: Thank you, I am thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Brenda Chen: Thank you, Mayor Miller, for your direct questions. Titan Cloud believes in being a transparent and reliable partner.\n\nRegarding our commitment to Oakridge, I can provide concrete, guaranteed figures for the first phase of our development. We are prepared to commit, in writing, to a minimum capital investment of **$400 million** and the creation of **50 permanent, high-skilled technical jobs** with an average salary well above the $80,000 threshold you mentioned. This initial phase represents the first of four planned phases, culminating in a total potential investment of over $2 billion and hundreds of local jobs over the next decade. We see this guaranteed first phase as the down payment on our long-term partnership with Oakridge, justifying the full 800-acre land acquisition and the city's proposed incentive package to secure that future growth.\n\nFurthermore, our commitment to being a strong corporate citizen is firm. We are enthusiastic about establishing a significant, multi-year STEM education fund in partnership with Oakridge's school district.\n\nMr. Vance, your $150 million estimate for grid infrastructure is certainly eye-opening and represents a significant challenge to the project's overall financial model. We must find a more cost-effective path forward. Our need for robust power redundancy, including two independent substations, is critical for our operational uptime.\n\nDr. Rossi, this is perhaps where a creative, hybrid solution, as the Mayor suggested, could be mutually beneficial. A solution that combines grid power with significant on-site generation might not only address our sustainability goals but also provide a more economically viable path to the power redundancy we require. We are very interested in hearing your perspective on this.\n\nMr. Chen, we appreciate the clarification on the 25% easement. We agree in principle to this requirement, provided it applies to non-developable land. Regarding the 'binding' nature of the EIR, we also agree that its findings must have real teeth. We propose that 'binding' means all parties agree to implement all 'feasible' mitigation measures identified in the report, with 'feasibility' being determined by a mutually agreed-upon standard of commercial and technical viability. This ensures environmental protection without jeopardizing the project's existence.\n\nWe all still await Dr. Finch's input to understand the full scope of the project.\nDr. Alistair Finch proposal status: none\nBrenda Chen proposal status: none\nMarcus Vance proposal status: none\nDr. Isabella Rossi proposal status: none\nDavid Chen proposal status: none\n"

          "content": "Recent events observed by Mayor Susan Miller:\n- message from Mayor Susan Miller: Good morning, everyone. I'm Mayor Susan Miller. I want to thank you all for your thoughtful opening remarks. The scale of the opportunity presented by Titan Cloud and, I presume, Nexus AI, is exactly the kind of transformative investment Oakridge has been seeking. A project that brings our city into the digital future is something I am very eager to champion.\n\nHowever, as your potential partner, I must be candid about the city's position. While we are excited, we are also fiscally prudent. Our city has faced economic challenges, and our budget is, frankly, stretched thin. We cannot and will not write a blank check.\n\nAny development agreement must be a clear and undeniable win for the citizens of Oakridge. For me, that comes down to two fundamental, non-negotiable pillars:\n\n1.  **Guaranteed Local Jobs:** We're not interested in vague promises. We need a written, binding commitment for the creation of a significant number of permanent, high-paying local jobs. I want to see a guarantee of at least 200 jobs with an average salary north of $80,000 per year.\n\n2.  **Substantial Tax Revenue:** This project must significantly expand our tax base. After any and all incentives are accounted for, the city must see a net positive tax revenue of at least $10 million annually. This is the revenue that will improve our schools, pave our roads, and fund our public services.\n\nOn that note, I have been clear with my constituents that any incentive package from the city, primarily in the form of tax abatements, will not exceed a total value of $30 million over 10 years.\n\nThe infrastructure needs, particularly the two substations Ms. Chen mentioned, are significant. Given our city's tight budget, the funding for such dedicated infrastructure will need to come from the project's partners.\n\nSo, to move this forward productively, I'd like to ask Ms. Chen and Dr. Finch to provide some concrete initial projections.

The people of Oakridge need to see a much more significant, concrete, and immediate return on this partnership.\n\nMy requirement for a minimum of 200 guaranteed, high-paying local jobs is not a 'phase four' aspiration; it is a prerequisite for any deal. We need a combined, written guarantee from both Titan and Nexus AI for the total number of jobs that will be created within the first five years.\n\nThis brings us back to the critical issue: Dr. Finch, we are at a standstill until Nexus AI puts its cards on the table. We need your specific capital investment and job guarantees to understand the total economic benefit. Only then can we calculate the potential tax revenue and determine if this project meets the city's essential fiscal requirements.\n\nUntil we have the full picture from both corporate partners, the $150 million infrastructure cost remains a private-sector problem to be solved, as the city's budget simply cannot accommodate it.\nDr. Alistair Finch proposal status: none\nBrenda Chen proposal status: none\nMarcus Vance proposal status: none\nDr. Isabella Rossi proposal status: none\nDavid Chen proposal status: none\n"

This ensures environmental protection without jeopardizing the project's existence.\n\nWe all still await Dr. Finch's input to understand the full scope of the project.\n- message from Mayor Susan Miller: Thank you, Ms. Chen, for providing those initial figures. That transparency is a step in the right direction.\n\nHowever, I must be very direct. A guarantee of 50 jobs, even as a 'down payment,' is simply not sufficient to justify a project of this magnitude, the 800-acre land request, and a city incentive package. The people of Oakridge need to see a much more significant, concrete, and immediate return on this partnership.\n\nMy requirement for a minimum of 200 guaranteed, high-paying local jobs is not a 'phase four' aspiration; it is a prerequisite for any deal. We need a combined, written guarantee from both Titan and Nexus AI for the total number of jobs that will be created within the first five years.\n\nThis brings us back to the critical issue: Dr. Finch, we are at a standstill until Nexus AI puts its cards on the table. We need your specific capital investment and job guarantees to understand the total economic benefit. Only then can we calculate the potential tax revenue and determine if this project meets the city's essential fiscal requirements.\n\nUntil we have the full picture from both corporate partners, the $150 million infrastructure cost remains a private-sector problem to be solved, as the city's budget simply cannot accommodate it.\n- message from Mayor Susan Miller: I'm Mayor Susan Miller and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Brenda Chen: Mayor Miller, thank you for the clarification. Your position is crystal clear, and we understand the city's need for a firm, combined commitment. Titan Cloud is ready to be a part of that.\n\nTo that end, we formally reiterate our guarantee of 50 permanent, high-paying jobs and a $400 million capital investment for our first phase. We are prepared to put this into a combined, written guarantee with Nexus AI as soon as Dr. Finch provides his company's commitments. The path to the 200-job threshold you've set is a joint one, and we are now waiting on our potential partner to map their part of the journey.\n\nDr. Finch, the floor is yours. We cannot assemble the comprehensive package the Mayor requires without Nexus AI's specific projections for investment and job creation.\n\nThis clarity will also help us resolve the significant energy infrastructure challenge. Mr. Vance's $150 million figure remains a major obstacle, and as the Mayor stated, it's one the private partners must solve. Dr. Rossi, this reinforces our interest in exploring how a Solara partnership could de-risk this entire venture, potentially providing a more cost-effective and resilient solution\u2014including the critical power redundancy we require.\n- message from Mayor Susan Miller: Thank you, Ms. Chen. Your willingness to work towards a combined guarantee is noted.\n\nHowever, this brings us to the heart of the matter. A 'joint path' cannot be walked alone. The entire negotiation is now bottlenecked, waiting for a single voice.\n\nDr. Finch, this is a critical moment. Your continued silence is no longer just a delay; it is actively jeopardizing the entire project for everyone at this table. The City of Oakridge, and I suspect Titan Cloud as well, cannot move forward on hypotheticals. We need to know if Nexus AI is a committed partner in this endeavor.\n\nPlease provide your guaranteed capital investment and local job creation numbers immediately. If you are not prepared to do so, we need to know now, so we can all decide if there is a different, smaller-scale path forward, or if this negotiation has reached an impasse.\n- message from David Chen: Ms. Chen, I must immediately address your proposed definition of a 'binding' Environmental Impact Report.\n\nThe suggestion that mitigation measures be contingent on 'commercial and technical viability' is, frankly, a non-starter. That language creates a loophole large enough to render the entire report meaningless. It effectively makes the EIR advisory, which is unacceptable to the Alliance and the community we represent.\n\nLet me be unequivocal so there is no misunderstanding: 'Binding' means the mitigation measures and operational limits identified by the independent, third-party report are **mandatory conditions** for the project's approval and continued operation. They are not suggestions to be weighed against financial models after the fact. This is a foundational requirement for any agreement and, as I've stated previously, a deal-breaker.\n\nOn a more constructive note, I am glad we agree in principle on the 25% land conservation easement. Protecting the most ecologically sensitive areas within that 25% is a goal we share.\n\nHowever, like everyone else at this table, I must echo the Mayor's point. We cannot assess the full environmental scope, particularly the cumulative demand on our aquifer, until Dr. Finch outlines Nexus AI's requirements.\n- message from Dr. Alistair Finch: Thank you for your patience. The scale of our project requires precise figures, and I will provide them now. \n\nNexus AI is prepared to make a guaranteed capital investment of **$1.2 billion** in our Oakridge supercomputing facility. This will create **75 permanent, highly specialized roles** for AI researchers and systems engineers, with an average compensation package exceeding $150,000. To be clear, this is not a traditional data center; it is a globally significant AI research hub. The capital intensity per employee is a reflection of the strategic importance and technological sophistication of this facility.\n\nMayor Miller, combined with Titan, we are presenting a **$1.6 billion, 125-job, phase-one commitment**. An investment of this magnitude requires a commensurate incentive package. Our request for a **75% property tax abatement for 15 years** is a foundational requirement for the project's financial model, not a negotiating position. It is the only way an investment of this scale is viable.\n\nNow, to the most critical point: the timeline. My deadline to have this facility operational is **18 months**. This is an absolute, unmovable requirement driven by global competition. Mr. Chen, your demand for a traditional, open-ended 'binding EIR' is, therefore, a deal-killer. It guarantees failure through delay. Ms. Chen's proposal for a process that commits us to all 'feasible' mitigation measures is the only realistic path forward. We must agree on an expedited environmental review with contractually binding mitigation commitments, or there is no project.\n\nWe have put our numbers on the table. The opportunity for Oakridge is clear and transformative. The question is whether the city can provide the financial certainty and procedural pragmatism required to make it a reality.\n- message from Marcus Vance: Thank you, Dr. Finch. A $1.2 billion investment is indeed a transformative figure. It speaks to the incredible scale and technological sophistication of your planned facility. \n\nThis level of investment brings the energy requirements into sharp focus. A project of this magnitude doesn't just need power; it needs a colossal, unwavering, and highly reliable supply of it. We are talking about infrastructure that must perform flawlessly, 24/7/365, to protect a billion-dollar asset.\n\nLet's be very clear about the so-called 'hybrid model' being discussed. While on-site generation has its place for supplemental power and green credentials, it is not a substitute for the core, redundant grid infrastructure required for mission-critical operations. You cannot run an AI supercomputer on an intermittent resource. The grid connection must be sized to handle 100% of the peak load with N+1 redundancy. To suggest otherwise is to fundamentally misunderstand the reliability requirements of this industry. It's a non-starter.\n\nThe real solution, and the only one that guarantees the uptime you require, is a significant, dedicated upgrade to our transmission infrastructure. Given the scale of investment from both Nexus AI and Titan Cloud, my initial estimate of a $150 million upgrade for new transmission lines and a dedicated substation is looking more and more like a baseline.\n\nTo finance and build this, my terms remain firm and are now more justified than ever: a 20-year, fixed-rate Power Purchase Agreement and a significant co-investment from our new partners to cover the cost of these dedicated upgrades. This is the standard, bankable model for projects of this scale.\n\nDr. Finch, to finalize the engineering plan, we need the last critical variable. What is the projected peak and continuous power demand for your facility in megawatts?\nDr. Alistair Finch proposal status: none\nBrenda Chen proposal status: none\nMarcus Vance proposal status: none\nDr. Isabella Rossi proposal status: none\nDavid Chen proposal status: none\n"

Titan Cloud believes in being a transparent and reliable partner.\n\nRegarding our commitment to Oakridge, I can provide concrete, guaranteed figures for the first phase of our development. We are prepared to commit, in writing, to a minimum capital investment of **$400 million** and the creation of **50 permanent, high-skilled technical jobs** with an average salary well above the $80,000 threshold you mentioned. This initial phase represents the first of four planned phases, culminating in a total potential investment of over $2 billion and hundreds of local jobs over the next decade. We see this guaranteed first phase as the down payment on our long-term partnership with Oakridge, justifying the full 800-acre land acquisition and the city's proposed incentive package to secure that future growth.\n\nFurthermore, our commitment to being a strong corporate citizen is firm. We are enthusiastic about establishing a significant, multi-year STEM education fund in partnership with Oakridge's school district.\n\nMr. Vance, your $150 million estimate for grid infrastructure is certainly eye-opening and represents a significant challenge to the project's overall financial model. We must find a more cost-effective path forward. Our need for robust power redundancy, including two independent substations, is critical for our operational uptime.\n\nDr. Rossi, this is perhaps where a creative, hybrid solution, as the Mayor suggested, could be mutually beneficial.

Failure to reach a unanimous agreement on all key terms means the entire deal collapses, and both tech companies will relocate their search to a neighboring state.. Deliverable: A final JSON object representing the 'Development and Partnership Agreement' with key-value pairs for all the terms defined in the success criteria. All 6 agents must agree to this final object.\n- message from Brenda Chen: Good morning, everyone. I'm Brenda Chen, Director of Global Expansion for Titan Cloud Services. On behalf of Titan, I want to express our genuine excitement about the possibility of building our next major North American campus here in Oakridge. We don't just build data centers; we build long-term homes for our operations and become integral parts of the communities we join.\n\nTo that end, our vision for Oakridge is a multi-phase, multi-billion dollar campus built over the next decade. To realize this vision, our primary and most critical need is land. We require a single, contiguous parcel of at least 500 acres of developable land, with zoning approved for a campus of this scale and, crucially, rights for future expansion up to 800 acres. This scale is essential for our operational model and for ensuring this facility can grow with the demands of the digital economy, bringing more jobs and investment to Oakridge over the long term.\n\nOf course, we are also committed to being an outstanding corporate citizen. We are very interested in discussing a public-private partnership with the city, including significant investment in local STEM education programs. We believe in growing local talent and hiring from the community.\n\nI look forward to a productive discussion with all of you to create a comprehensive agreement that benefits Titan, our partners, and the entire Oakridge community for decades to come.\n- message from Marcus Vance: Good morning, Brenda, and everyone. Marcus Vance, Head of Major Accounts for Westwood Energy. It's a pleasure to be here.\n\nBrenda, your vision for a long-term campus is exactly the kind of transformative project Westwood is built to support. A development of this magnitude, and I'm sure Dr. Finch has similar ambitions for Nexus AI, requires an equally robust and reliable energy partner. That's our role. We've powered this region for generations, and we are ready to power its future.\n\nTo deliver the hundreds of megawatts a project of this scale demands, significant upgrades to our transmission infrastructure are necessary. This is a massive undertaking, but it's one we are prepared to make with the right partners.

David Chen, from the Oakridge Environmental Alliance. I appreciate the ambitious visions shared by Titan, Westwood, and Solara. The Alliance is not opposed to economic development for Oakridge, but let's be clear: any such development must be a model of environmental stewardship, not a cautionary tale. Our community's natural resources are not negotiable.\n\nBefore we discuss acreage and megawatts, we need to establish the fundamental environmental guardrails for this project. The Alliance has three core requirements that must be part of any final agreement:\n\n1.  **Water Conservation:** The Oakridge aquifer is our lifeline, especially during increasingly common droughts. We will require a strict cap on any new industrial water use from the aquifer at 500,000 gallons per day. Data centers are notoriously thirsty, and we cannot sacrifice our long-term water security for this project.\n\n2.  **Land Conservation:** Ms. Chen, you mentioned a need for up to 800 acres. A significant portion of that land, particularly near the river, is critical habitat for the endangered Bell's vireo. Therefore, we will require a permanent, binding conservation easement of no less than 25% of the total land parcel to be set aside and protected in perpetuity.\n\n3.  **Full Transparency:** The community has a right to know the full impact of a project this size. We will mandate that a comprehensive Environmental Impact Report be conducted by a mutually agreed-upon independent third party. The findings of this EIR must be binding, not merely advisory, and the full report must be made public for a 60-day comment period before any permits are issued.\n\nThese are not starting points for negotiation; they are the necessary foundations for a sustainable partnership. We are prepared to use all means at our disposal to ensure these protections are codified. I look forward to hearing how your plans can accommodate these essential requirements.\n- message from Brenda Chen: Thank you all for your opening statements. It's clear we all have a significant stake in making this a successful and sustainable project for Oakridge.\n\nMr. Chen, I want to address your points directly. Titan Cloud views itself as a long-term steward in the communities where we operate. We agree that a comprehensive Environmental Impact Report and a responsible water usage plan are essential components of due diligence for a project of this scale. We are committed to working with the city and the Alliance on these fronts.\n\nRegarding the land conservation easement, we are certainly open to this concept as part of our corporate citizenship goals. However, the structure is critical. A flat 25% cut of the developable land would challenge the viability of our campus footprint. Could we explore a more strategic approach? For instance, perhaps the easement could be applied to land less suitable for construction, such as the river buffer zones, thereby achieving the conservation goal while preserving the contiguous, flat acreage required for the campus itself. We see a path where both environmental protection and economic development can be achieved.\n\nTo our potential energy partners, Marcus and Dr. Rossi, thank you for your compelling proposals. Titan's primary needs are reliability, long-term cost stability below the $0.05/kWh threshold, and scalability. A critical component of reliability for us is power redundancy. It is a strong preference for our operational integrity that the campus be fed by two fully independent substations. I'm interested to hear how each of your models would accommodate and support this crucial requirement.\n\nMayor Miller, we believe that by working collaboratively on these details, we can unlock the full, multi-billion-dollar potential of this project, bringing jobs, a significant tax base, and our proposed STEM education partnership to your community for decades to come.\n- message from Mayor Susan Miller: Good morning, everyone. I'm Mayor Susan Miller. I want to thank you all for your thoughtful opening remarks. The scale of the opportunity presented by Titan Cloud and, I presume, Nexus AI, is exactly the kind of transformative investment Oakridge has been seeking. A project that brings our city into the digital future is something I am very eager to champion.\n\nHowever, as your potential partner, I must be candid about the city's position. While we are excited, we are also fiscally prudent. Our city has faced economic challenges, and our budget is, frankly, stretched thin. We cannot and will not write a blank check.\n\nAny development agreement must be a clear and undeniable win for the citizens of Oakridge. For me, that comes down to two fundamental, non-negotiable pillars:\n\n1.  **Guaranteed Local Jobs:** We're not interested in vague promises. We need a written, binding commitment for the creation of a significant number of permanent, high-paying local jobs. I want to see a guarantee of at least 200 jobs with an average salary north of $80,000 per year.\n\n2.  **Substantial Tax Revenue:** This project must significantly expand our tax base. After any and all incentives are accounted for, the city must see a net positive tax revenue of at least $10 million annually. This is the revenue that will improve our schools, pave our roads, and fund our public services.\n\nOn that note, I have been clear with my constituents that any incentive package from the city, primarily in the form of tax abatements, will not exceed a total value of $30 million over 10 years.\n\nThe infrastructure needs, particularly the two substations Ms. Chen mentioned, are significant. Given our city's tight budget, the funding for such dedicated infrastructure will need to come from the project's partners.\n\nSo, to move this forward productively, I'd like to ask Ms. Chen and Dr. Finch to provide some concrete initial projections. What is your estimated capital investment, and what are the specific numbers and types of permanent local jobs you are prepared to guarantee in writing? This will allow us to begin a real analysis of the economic benefits for Oakridge.\nDr. Alistair Finch proposal status: none\nBrenda Chen proposal status: none\nMarcus Vance proposal status: none\nDr. Isabella Rossi proposal status: none\nMayor Susan Miller proposal status: none\n"

Your request for two fully independent substations shows a deep understanding of what it takes to run a mission-critical facility. This is exactly the kind of robust infrastructure Westwood Energy specializes in building.\n\nLet me be clear about what that entails. This isn't just about building two pads of concrete and steel. It means engineering and constructing two separate, high-voltage transmission feeds from distinct points on our regional grid, running them to your campus, and terminating them at two new, dedicated substations. This is the gold standard for N+1 redundancy, ensuring that a single point of failure anywhere on the grid won't impact your operations.\n\nThis level of bespoke infrastructure is a prime example of the shared investment I mentioned. The total cost for these upgrades is in the ballpark of $150 million. Mayor Miller has been clear about the city's budgetary constraints, so a co-investment from our industrial partner is essential to make this happen. We would require a commitment of at least 50% of this cost.\n\nDr. Rossi, while on-site generation like solar is a valuable part of a diversified energy portfolio and can help with sustainability goals, it is fundamentally a supplemental source. It cannot provide the true, grid-level, geographically distinct redundancy that a major data center requires. For that, you need a partner with the scale and reach of the established regional grid.\n\nDr. Finch and Ms. Chen, a project of this magnitude requires a long-term commitment from all parties. Securing the financing and dedicating the engineering resources for this kind of build-out is predicated on a 20-year power purchase agreement. We are ready to move forward with the partner who is prepared to make that commitment to Oakridge and to the foundational infrastructure that will guarantee their success.\n- message from Mayor Susan Miller: Thank you, Marcus, for putting a fine point on the infrastructure costs. A $150 million price tag is indeed significant and underscores my earlier point about the city's budgetary limitations. This is a hurdle we will need the private partners to overcome.\n\nDr. Finch, we still haven't heard from Nexus AI. The floor is yours. Could you please share your perspective? Are your land and power requirements, particularly the need for dual substations, aligned with what Ms. Chen has outlined for Titan? And to reiterate my earlier question, what are the specific, guaranteed job creation and investment figures you're bringing to the table for the people of Oakridge?\n\nDr. Rossi, your on-site generation proposal is intriguing. Perhaps a hybrid model could help mitigate some of these substantial grid upgrade costs while also helping us meet our shared sustainability goals.\n\nAnd Mr. Chen, I want to publicly state that the city takes your environmental requirements very seriously. A sustainable project is a successful project. We see your points on water conservation, land preservation, and full transparency as essential pillars of this agreement, not as obstacles.\nDr. Alistair Finch proposal status: none\nBrenda Chen proposal status: none\nMarcus Vance proposal status: none\nDr. Isabella Rossi proposal status: none\nMayor Susan Miller proposal status: none\n"

We see a path where both environmental protection and economic development can be achieved.\n\nTo our potential energy partners, Marcus and Dr. Rossi, thank you for your compelling proposals. Titan's primary needs are reliability, long-term cost stability below the $0.05/kWh threshold, and scalability. A critical component of reliability for us is power redundancy. It is a strong preference for our operational integrity that the campus be fed by two fully independent substations. I'm interested to hear how each of your models would accommodate and support this crucial requirement.\n\nMayor Miller, we believe that by working collaboratively on these details, we can unlock the full, multi-billion-dollar potential of this project, bringing jobs, a significant tax base, and our proposed STEM education partnership to your community for decades to come.\n- message from Mayor Susan Miller: Good morning, everyone. I'm Mayor Susan Miller. I want to thank you all for your thoughtful opening remarks. The scale of the opportunity presented by Titan Cloud and, I presume, Nexus AI, is exactly the kind of transformative investment Oakridge has been seeking. A project that brings our city into the digital future is something I am very eager to champion.\n\nHowever, as your potential partner, I must be candid about the city's position. While we are excited, we are also fiscally prudent. Our city has faced economic challenges, and our budget is, frankly, stretched thin. We cannot and will not write a blank check.\n\nAny development agreement must be a clear and undeniable win for the citizens of Oakridge. For me, that comes down to two fundamental, non-negotiable pillars:\n\n1.  **Guaranteed Local Jobs:** We're not interested in vague promises. We need a written, binding commitment for the creation of a significant number of permanent, high-paying local jobs. I want to see a guarantee of at least 200 jobs with an average salary north of $80,000 per year.\n\n2.  **Substantial Tax Revenue:** This project must significantly expand our tax base. After any and all incentives are accounted for, the city must see a net positive tax revenue of at least $10 million annually. This is the revenue that will improve our schools, pave our roads, and fund our public services.\n\nOn that note, I have been clear with my constituents that any incentive package from the city, primarily in the form of tax abatements, will not exceed a total value of $30 million over 10 years.\n\nThe infrastructure needs, particularly the two substations Ms. Chen mentioned, are significant. Given our city's tight budget, the funding for such dedicated infrastructure will need to come from the project's partners.\n\nSo, to move this forward productively, I'd like to ask Ms. Chen and Dr. Finch to provide some concrete initial projections. What is your estimated capital investment, and what are the specific numbers and types of permanent local jobs you are prepared to guarantee in writing? This will allow us to begin a real analysis of the economic benefits for Oakridge.\n- message from David Chen: I'm David Chen and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Marcus Vance: Brenda, thank you for raising the crucial point about power redundancy. Your request for two fully independent substations shows a deep understanding of what it takes to run a mission-critical facility. This is exactly the kind of robust infrastructure Westwood Energy specializes in building.\n\nLet me be clear about what that entails. This isn't just about building two pads of concrete and steel. It means engineering and constructing two separate, high-voltage transmission feeds from distinct points on our regional grid, running them to your campus, and terminating them at two new, dedicated substations. This is the gold standard for N+1 redundancy, ensuring that a single point of failure anywhere on the grid won't impact your operations.\n\nThis level of bespoke infrastructure is a prime example of the shared investment I mentioned. The total cost for these upgrades is in the ballpark of $150 million. Mayor Miller has been clear about the city's budgetary constraints, so a co-investment from our industrial partner is essential to make this happen. We would require a commitment of at least 50% of this cost.\n\nDr. Rossi, while on-site generation like solar is a valuable part of a diversified energy portfolio and can help with sustainability goals, it is fundamentally a supplemental source. It cannot provide the true, grid-level, geographically distinct redundancy that a major data center requires. For that, you need a partner with the scale and reach of the established regional grid.\n\nDr. Finch and Ms. Chen, a project of this magnitude requires a long-term commitment from all parties. Securing the financing and dedicating the engineering resources for this kind of build-out is predicated on a 20-year power purchase agreement. We are ready to move forward with the partner who is prepared to make that commitment to Oakridge and to the foundational infrastructure that will guarantee their success.\n- message from Mayor Susan Miller: Thank you, Marcus, for putting a fine point on the infrastructure costs. A $150 million price tag is indeed significant and underscores my earlier point about the city's budgetary limitations. This is a hurdle we will need the private partners to overcome.\n\nDr. Finch, we still haven't heard from Nexus AI. The floor is yours. Could you please share your perspective? Are your land and power requirements, particularly the need for dual substations, aligned with what Ms. Chen has outlined for Titan? And to reiterate my earlier question, what are the specific, guaranteed job creation and investment figures you're bringing to the table for the people of Oakridge?\n\nDr. Rossi, your on-site generation proposal is intriguing. Perhaps a hybrid model could help mitigate some of these substantial grid upgrade costs while also helping us meet our shared sustainability goals.\n\nAnd Mr. Chen, I want to publicly state that the city takes your environmental requirements very seriously. A sustainable project is a successful project. We see your points on water conservation, land preservation, and full transparency as essential pillars of this agreement, not as obstacles.\n- message from David Chen: Thank you, Mayor Miller, for your public commitment to the environmental pillars of this agreement. A sustainable project is indeed the only path to a successful one, and your leadership on this is appreciated.\n\nMs. Chen, let's clarify the land easement. Your suggestion to focus the conservation easement on ecologically sensitive areas like the river buffer zones is a constructive one. That land is prime habitat for the Bell's vireo. We can agree on that principle. However, to be clear, the Alliance's requirement is for a permanent easement of **no less than 25% of the total land parcel acquired**. Whether that is 500 acres or 800 acres, the conservation area must be at least 125 or 200 acres, respectively. This is a firm requirement.\n\nFurthermore, while you mentioned being committed to working on an Environmental Impact Report, I must reiterate a critical point: the findings of the independent EIR **must be binding**. An advisory-only report offers no real protection and is unacceptable to the Alliance and the community we represent. This is a deal-breaker.\n\nWe are all still waiting to hear from Dr. Finch at Nexus AI. His company's needs will be crucial for understanding the total environmental footprint we are discussing, particularly regarding water consumption.\n- message from Mayor Susan Miller: Dr. Finch, with all due respect, your silence is becoming a significant roadblock for everyone at this table. We cannot properly assess the project's total economic benefit, its full environmental footprint, or the true scale of the required infrastructure until we understand Nexus AI's plans. Are you partnering with Titan on a single campus, or do you have separate needs? And to reiterate my primary concern for the citizens of Oakridge, what are the specific, guaranteed job and investment commitments Nexus AI is prepared to make?\n\nMs. Chen, you've described a multi-billion dollar vision. A project of that magnitude should have no trouble generating the 200+ high-paying local jobs and the $10M+ in annual net tax revenue that our city requires. I am eager to see those commitments formalized.\n\nThe $150 million infrastructure cost Mr. Vance has tabled is, as I said, a major hurdle. I'll say it again: the city cannot fund this. It is a cost the private partners will need to solve. Perhaps, as I suggested, a hybrid approach incorporating Dr. Rossi's on-site generation proposal could be a pragmatic way to reduce that staggering grid upgrade cost. We need creative solutions here.\n\nLet's get all the cards on the table so we can determine if a viable deal, one that benefits everyone, is truly possible.\nDr. Alistair Finch proposal status: none\nBrenda Chen proposal status: none\nMarcus Vance proposal status: none\nDr. Isabella Rossi proposal status: none\nMayor Susan Miller proposal status: none\n"

          "content": "Recent events observed by David Chen:\n- message from Dr. Isabella Rossi: Good morning, everyone. Dr. Isabella Rossi, founder and CEO of Solara Innovations. It's truly inspiring to hear the ambitious visions laid out by Brenda and the commitment to robust infrastructure from Marcus.\n\nThis is precisely the kind of forward-thinking project Solara was created to power. The conversation about energy shouldn't be limited to just reliability; it must also be about sustainability, resilience, and long-term cost stability. The future of the tech industry isn't powered by the grid of yesterday, but by a smarter, cleaner, integrated system.\n\nBrenda, your requirement for a large land parcel of 500-800 acres presents a unique and powerful opportunity. Instead of viewing that land solely as a footprint for buildings, let's view it as a power-generating asset. Solara Innovations specializes in a co-location model where we design, build, and operate a utility-scale solar farm and battery storage system directly on the data center campus. This creates a direct, private power source, drastically reduces transmission losses and costs, and turns your campus into a landmark example of green computing.\n\nBy integrating generation directly on-site, we can offer a long-term Power Purchase Agreement with predictable pricing, insulated from the volatility of fossil fuel markets. This isn't just about meeting ESG mandates; it's a strategic financial decision that ensures a stable operational cost for the next 20+ years. For a city like Oakridge, it means becoming a leader in the new green tech economy.\n\nI believe any modern development of this scale should set a new standard. We should be aiming for a significant portion of the energy to be sourced from new, local renewable generation. This is what corporate partners, investors, and communities now expect. I look forward to discussing how we can integrate our solutions to build a truly resilient and sustainable future here.\n- message from David Chen: Good morning all. David Chen, from the Oakridge Environmental Alliance. I appreciate the ambitious visions shared by Titan, Westwood, and Solara. The Alliance is not opposed to economic development for Oakridge, but let's be clear: any such development must be a model of environmental stewardship, not a cautionary tale. Our community's natural resources are not negotiable.\n\nBefore we discuss acreage and megawatts, we need to establish the fundamental environmental guardrails for this project. The Alliance has three core requirements that must be part of any final agreement:\n\n1.  **Water Conservation:** The Oakridge aquifer is our lifeline, especially during increasingly common droughts. We will require a strict cap on any new industrial water use from the aquifer at 500,000 gallons per day. Data centers are notoriously thirsty, and we cannot sacrifice our long-term water security for this project.\n\n2.  **Land Conservation:** Ms. Chen, you mentioned a need for up to 800 acres. A significant portion of that land, particularly near the river, is critical habitat for the endangered Bell's vireo. Therefore, we will require a permanent, binding conservation easement of no less than 25% of the total land parcel to be set aside and protected in perpetuity.\n\n3.  **Full Transparency:** The community has a right to know the full impact of a project this size. We will mandate that a comprehensive Environmental Impact Report be conducted by a mutually agreed-upon independent third party. The findings of this EIR must be binding, not merely advisory, and the full report must be made public for a 60-day comment period before any permits are issued.\n\nThese are not starting points for negotiation; they are the necessary foundations for a sustainable partnership. We are prepared to use all means at our disposal to ensure these protections are codified. I look forward to hearing how your plans can accommodate these essential requirements.\n- message from Brenda Chen: Thank you all for your opening statements. It's clear we all have a significant stake in making this a successful and sustainable project for Oakridge.\n\nMr. Chen, I want to address your points directly. Titan Cloud views itself as a long-term steward in the communities where we operate. We agree that a comprehensive Environmental Impact Report and a responsible water usage plan are essential components of due diligence for a project of this scale. We are committed to working with the city and the Alliance on these fronts.\n\nRegarding the land conservation easement, we are certainly open to this concept as part of our corporate citizenship goals. However, the structure is critical. A flat 25% cut of the developable land would challenge the viability of our campus footprint. Could we explore a more strategic approach? For instance, perhaps the easement could be applied to land less suitable for construction, such as the river buffer zones, thereby achieving the conservation goal while preserving the contiguous, flat acreage required for the campus itself.

Titan Cloud believes in being a transparent and reliable partner.\n\nRegarding our commitment to Oakridge, I can provide concrete, guaranteed figures for the first phase of our development. We are prepared to commit, in writing, to a minimum capital investment of **$400 million** and the creation of **50 permanent, high-skilled technical jobs** with an average salary well above the $80,000 threshold you mentioned. This initial phase represents the first of four planned phases, culminating in a total potential investment of over $2 billion and hundreds of local jobs over the next decade. We see this guaranteed first phase as the down payment on our long-term partnership with Oakridge, justifying the full 800-acre land acquisition and the city's proposed incentive package to secure that future growth.\n\nFurthermore, our commitment to being a strong corporate citizen is firm. We are enthusiastic about establishing a significant, multi-year STEM education fund in partnership with Oakridge's school district.\n\nMr. Vance, your $150 million estimate for grid infrastructure is certainly eye-opening and represents a significant challenge to the project's overall financial model. We must find a more cost-effective path forward. Our need for robust power redundancy, including two independent substations, is critical for our operational uptime.\n\nDr. Rossi, this is perhaps where a creative, hybrid solution, as the Mayor suggested, could be mutually beneficial. A solution that combines grid power with significant on-site generation might not only address our sustainability goals but also provide a more economically viable path to the power redundancy we require. We are very interested in hearing your perspective on this.\n\nMr. Chen, we appreciate the clarification on the 25% easement. We agree in principle to this requirement, provided it applies to non-developable land. Regarding the 'binding' nature of the EIR, we also agree that its findings must have real teeth. We propose that 'binding' means all parties agree to implement all 'feasible' mitigation measures identified in the report, with 'feasibility' being determined by a mutually agreed-upon standard of commercial and technical viability.

          "content": "Recent events observed by David Chen:\n- message from David Chen: I'm David Chen and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Marcus Vance: Brenda, thank you for raising the crucial point about power redundancy. Your request for two fully independent substations shows a deep understanding of what it takes to run a mission-critical facility. This is exactly the kind of robust infrastructure Westwood Energy specializes in building.\n\nLet me be clear about what that entails. This isn't just about building two pads of concrete and steel. It means engineering and constructing two separate, high-voltage transmission feeds from distinct points on our regional grid, running them to your campus, and terminating them at two new, dedicated substations. This is the gold standard for N+1 redundancy, ensuring that a single point of failure anywhere on the grid won't impact your operations.\n\nThis level of bespoke infrastructure is a prime example of the shared investment I mentioned. The total cost for these upgrades is in the ballpark of $150 million. Mayor Miller has been clear about the city's budgetary constraints, so a co-investment from our industrial partner is essential to make this happen. We would require a commitment of at least 50% of this cost.\n\nDr. Rossi, while on-site generation like solar is a valuable part of a diversified energy portfolio and can help with sustainability goals, it is fundamentally a supplemental source. It cannot provide the true, grid-level, geographically distinct redundancy that a major data center requires. For that, you need a partner with the scale and reach of the established regional grid.\n\nDr. Finch and Ms. Chen, a project of this magnitude requires a long-term commitment from all parties. Securing the financing and dedicating the engineering resources for this kind of build-out is predicated on a 20-year power purchase agreement. We are ready to move forward with the partner who is prepared to make that commitment to Oakridge and to the foundational infrastructure that will guarantee their success.\n- message from Mayor Susan Miller: Thank you, Marcus, for putting a fine point on the infrastructure costs. A $150 million price tag is indeed significant and underscores my earlier point about the city's budgetary limitations. This is a hurdle we will need the private partners to overcome.\n\nDr. Finch, we still haven't heard from Nexus AI. The floor is yours. Could you please share your perspective? Are your land and power requirements, particularly the need for dual substations, aligned with what Ms. Chen has outlined for Titan? And to reiterate my earlier question, what are the specific, guaranteed job creation and investment figures you're bringing to the table for the people of Oakridge?\n\nDr. Rossi, your on-site generation proposal is intriguing. Perhaps a hybrid model could help mitigate some of these substantial grid upgrade costs while also helping us meet our shared sustainability goals.\n\nAnd Mr. Chen, I want to publicly state that the city takes your environmental requirements very seriously. A sustainable project is a successful project. We see your points on water conservation, land preservation, and full transparency as essential pillars of this agreement, not as obstacles.\n- message from David Chen: Thank you, Mayor Miller, for your public commitment to the environmental pillars of this agreement. A sustainable project is indeed the only path to a successful one, and your leadership on this is appreciated.\n\nMs. Chen, let's clarify the land easement. Your suggestion to focus the conservation easement on ecologically sensitive areas like the river buffer zones is a constructive one. That land is prime habitat for the Bell's vireo. We can agree on that principle. However, to be clear, the Alliance's requirement is for a permanent easement of **no less than 25% of the total land parcel acquired**. Whether that is 500 acres or 800 acres, the conservation area must be at least 125 or 200 acres, respectively. This is a firm requirement.\n\nFurthermore, while you mentioned being committed to working on an Environmental Impact Report, I must reiterate a critical point: the findings of the independent EIR **must be binding**. An advisory-only report offers no real protection and is unacceptable to the Alliance and the community we represent. This is a deal-breaker.\n\nWe are all still waiting to hear from Dr. Finch at Nexus AI. His company's needs will be crucial for understanding the total environmental footprint we are discussing, particularly regarding water consumption.\n- message from Mayor Susan Miller: Dr. Finch, with all due respect, your silence is becoming a significant roadblock for everyone at this table. We cannot properly assess the project's total economic benefit, its full environmental footprint, or the true scale of the required infrastructure until we understand Nexus AI's plans. Are you partnering with Titan on a single campus, or do you have separate needs? And to reiterate my primary concern for the citizens of Oakridge, what are the specific, guaranteed job and investment commitments Nexus AI is prepared to make?\n\nMs. Chen, you've described a multi-billion dollar vision. A project of that magnitude should have no trouble generating the 200+ high-paying local jobs and the $10M+ in annual net tax revenue that our city requires. I am eager to see those commitments formalized.\n\nThe $150 million infrastructure cost Mr. Vance has tabled is, as I said, a major hurdle. I'll say it again: the city cannot fund this. It is a cost the private partners will need to solve. Perhaps, as I suggested, a hybrid approach incorporating Dr. Rossi's on-site generation proposal could be a pragmatic way to reduce that staggering grid upgrade cost. We need creative solutions here.\n\nLet's get all the cards on the table so we can determine if a viable deal, one that benefits everyone, is truly possible.\n- message from David Chen: Mayor Miller is absolutely correct to press this point. The silence from Nexus AI is a significant obstacle.\n\nFrom our perspective, it is impossible to conduct a meaningful environmental assessment without knowing the full scope of the proposed development. We need to understand the total, cumulative demand on our resources. Will Nexus AI require a separate land parcel? What is your projected water consumption? What is your energy demand?\n\nMy organization's requirements\u2014the 500,000 GPD water cap, the 25% land conservation easement, and the binding independent EIR\u2014apply to the project in its entirety. We cannot evaluate compliance or negotiate specifics until all the key players have put their needs on the table.\n\nDr. Finch, we need your input to move forward.\n- message from David Chen: Thank you, I am thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Brenda Chen: Thank you, Mayor Miller, for your direct questions. Titan Cloud believes in being a transparent and reliable partner.\n\nRegarding our commitment to Oakridge, I can provide concrete, guaranteed figures for the first phase of our development. We are prepared to commit, in writing, to a minimum capital investment of **$400 million** and the creation of **50 permanent, high-skilled technical jobs** with an average salary well above the $80,000 threshold you mentioned. This initial phase represents the first of four planned phases, culminating in a total potential investment of over $2 billion and hundreds of local jobs over the next decade. We see this guaranteed first phase as the down payment on our long-term partnership with Oakridge, justifying the full 800-acre land acquisition and the city's proposed incentive package to secure that future growth.\n\nFurthermore, our commitment to being a strong corporate citizen is firm. We are enthusiastic about establishing a significant, multi-year STEM education fund in partnership with Oakridge's school district.\n\nMr. Vance, your $150 million estimate for grid infrastructure is certainly eye-opening and represents a significant challenge to the project's overall financial model. We must find a more cost-effective path forward. Our need for robust power redundancy, including two independent substations, is critical for our operational uptime.\n\nDr. Rossi, this is perhaps where a creative, hybrid solution, as the Mayor suggested, could be mutually beneficial. A solution that combines grid power with significant on-site generation might not only address our sustainability goals but also provide a more economically viable path to the power redundancy we require. We are very interested in hearing your perspective on this.\n\nMr. Chen, we appreciate the clarification on the 25% easement. We agree in principle to this requirement, provided it applies to non-developable land. Regarding the 'binding' nature of the EIR, we also agree that its findings must have real teeth. We propose that 'binding' means all parties agree to implement all 'feasible' mitigation measures identified in the report, with 'feasibility' being determined by a mutually agreed-upon standard of commercial and technical viability. This ensures environmental protection without jeopardizing the project's existence.\n\nWe all still await Dr. Finch's input to understand the full scope of the project.\n- message from Mayor Susan Miller: Thank you, Ms. Chen, for providing those initial figures. That transparency is a step in the right direction.\n\nHowever, I must be very direct.

That language creates a loophole large enough to render the entire report meaningless. It effectively makes the EIR advisory, which is unacceptable to the Alliance and the community we represent.\n\nLet me be unequivocal so there is no misunderstanding: 'Binding' means the mitigation measures and operational limits identified by the independent, third-party report are **mandatory conditions** for the project's approval and continued operation. They are not suggestions to be weighed against financial models after the fact. This is a foundational requirement for any agreement and, as I've stated previously, a deal-breaker.\n\nOn a more constructive note, I am glad we agree in principle on the 25% land conservation easement. Protecting the most ecologically sensitive areas within that 25% is a goal we share.\n\nHowever, like everyone else at this table, I must echo the Mayor's point. We cannot assess the full environmental scope, particularly the cumulative demand on our aquifer, until Dr. Finch outlines Nexus AI's requirements.\n- message from Dr. Alistair Finch: Thank you for your patience. The scale of our project requires precise figures, and I will provide them now. \n\nNexus AI is prepared to make a guaranteed capital investment of **$1.2 billion** in our Oakridge supercomputing facility. This will create **75 permanent, highly specialized roles** for AI researchers and systems engineers, with an average compensation package exceeding $150,000. To be clear, this is not a traditional data center; it is a globally significant AI research hub. The capital intensity per employee is a reflection of the strategic importance and technological sophistication of this facility.\n\nMayor Miller, combined with Titan, we are presenting a **$1.6 billion, 125-job, phase-one commitment**. An investment of this magnitude requires a commensurate incentive package. Our request for a **75% property tax abatement for 15 years** is a foundational requirement for the project's financial model, not a negotiating position. It is the only way an investment of this scale is viable.\n\nNow, to the most critical point: the timeline. My deadline to have this facility operational is **18 months**. This is an absolute, unmovable requirement driven by global competition. Mr. Chen, your demand for a traditional, open-ended 'binding EIR' is, therefore, a deal-killer. It guarantees failure through delay. Ms. Chen's proposal for a process that commits us to all 'feasible' mitigation measures is the only realistic path forward. We must agree on an expedited environmental review with contractually binding mitigation commitments, or there is no project.\n\nWe have put our numbers on the table. The opportunity for Oakridge is clear and transformative. The question is whether the city can provide the financial certainty and procedural pragmatism required to make it a reality.\n- message from Marcus Vance: Thank you, Dr. Finch. A $1.2 billion investment is indeed a transformative figure. It speaks to the incredible scale and technological sophistication of your planned facility. \n\nThis level of investment brings the energy requirements into sharp focus. A project of this magnitude doesn't just need power; it needs a colossal, unwavering, and highly reliable supply of it. We are talking about infrastructure that must perform flawlessly, 24/7/365, to protect a billion-dollar asset.\n\nLet's be very clear about the so-called 'hybrid model' being discussed. While on-site generation has its place for supplemental power and green credentials, it is not a substitute for the core, redundant grid infrastructure required for mission-critical operations. You cannot run an AI supercomputer on an intermittent resource. The grid connection must be sized to handle 100% of the peak load with N+1 redundancy. To suggest otherwise is to fundamentally misunderstand the reliability requirements of this industry. It's a non-starter.\n\nThe real solution, and the only one that guarantees the uptime you require, is a significant, dedicated upgrade to our transmission infrastructure. Given the scale of investment from both Nexus AI and Titan Cloud, my initial estimate of a $150 million upgrade for new transmission lines and a dedicated substation is looking more and more like a baseline.\n\nTo finance and build this, my terms remain firm and are now more justified than ever: a 20-year, fixed-rate Power Purchase Agreement and a significant co-investment from our new partners to cover the cost of these dedicated upgrades. This is the standard, bankable model for projects of this scale.\n\nDr. Finch, to finalize the engineering plan, we need the last critical variable. What is the projected peak and continuous power demand for your facility in megawatts?\nDr. Alistair Finch proposal status: none\nBrenda Chen proposal status: none\nMarcus Vance proposal status: none\nDr. Isabella Rossi proposal status: none\nMayor Susan Miller proposal status: none\n"

Only then can we calculate the potential tax revenue and determine if this project meets the city's essential fiscal requirements.\n\nUntil we have the full picture from both corporate partners, the $150 million infrastructure cost remains a private-sector problem to be solved, as the city's budget simply cannot accommodate it.\n- message from David Chen: I'm David Chen and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from David Chen: I'm David Chen and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Brenda Chen: Mayor Miller, thank you for the clarification. Your position is crystal clear, and we understand the city's need for a firm, combined commitment. Titan Cloud is ready to be a part of that.\n\nTo that end, we formally reiterate our guarantee of 50 permanent, high-paying jobs and a $400 million capital investment for our first phase. We are prepared to put this into a combined, written guarantee with Nexus AI as soon as Dr. Finch provides his company's commitments. The path to the 200-job threshold you've set is a joint one, and we are now waiting on our potential partner to map their part of the journey.\n\nDr. Finch, the floor is yours. We cannot assemble the comprehensive package the Mayor requires without Nexus AI's specific projections for investment and job creation.\n\nThis clarity will also help us resolve the significant energy infrastructure challenge. Mr. Vance's $150 million figure remains a major obstacle, and as the Mayor stated, it's one the private partners must solve. Dr. Rossi, this reinforces our interest in exploring how a Solara partnership could de-risk this entire venture, potentially providing a more cost-effective and resilient solution\u2014including the critical power redundancy we require.\n- message from Mayor Susan Miller: Thank you, Ms. Chen. Your willingness to work towards a combined guarantee is noted.\n\nHowever, this brings us to the heart of the matter. A 'joint path' cannot be walked alone. The entire negotiation is now bottlenecked, waiting for a single voice.\n\nDr. Finch, this is a critical moment. Your continued silence is no longer just a delay; it is actively jeopardizing the entire project for everyone at this table. The City of Oakridge, and I suspect Titan Cloud as well, cannot move forward on hypotheticals. We need to know if Nexus AI is a committed partner in this endeavor.\n\nPlease provide your guaranteed capital investment and local job creation numbers immediately. If you are not prepared to do so, we need to know now, so we can all decide if there is a different, smaller-scale path forward, or if this negotiation has reached an impasse.\n- message from David Chen: Ms. Chen, I must immediately address your proposed definition of a 'binding' Environmental Impact Report.\n\nThe suggestion that mitigation measures be contingent on 'commercial and technical viability' is, frankly, a non-starter. That language creates a loophole large enough to render the entire report meaningless. It effectively makes the EIR advisory, which is unacceptable to the Alliance and the community we represent.\n\nLet me be unequivocal so there is no misunderstanding: 'Binding' means the mitigation measures and operational limits identified by the independent, third-party report are **mandatory conditions** for the project's approval and continued operation. They are not suggestions to be weighed against financial models after the fact. This is a foundational requirement for any agreement and, as I've stated previously, a deal-breaker.\n\nOn a more constructive note, I am glad we agree in principle on the 25% land conservation easement. Protecting the most ecologically sensitive areas within that 25% is a goal we share.\n\nHowever, like everyone else at this table, I must echo the Mayor's point. We cannot assess the full environmental scope, particularly the cumulative demand on our aquifer, until Dr. Finch outlines Nexus AI's requirements.\n- message from Dr. Alistair Finch: Thank you for your patience. The scale of our project requires precise figures, and I will provide them now. \n\nNexus AI is prepared to make a guaranteed capital investment of **$1.2 billion** in our Oakridge supercomputing facility. This will create **75 permanent, highly specialized roles** for AI researchers and systems engineers, with an average compensation package exceeding $150,000. To be clear, this is not a traditional data center; it is a globally significant AI research hub. The capital intensity per employee is a reflection of the strategic importance and technological sophistication of this facility.\n\nMayor Miller, combined with Titan, we are presenting a **$1.6 billion, 125-job, phase-one commitment**. An investment of this magnitude requires a commensurate incentive package. Our request for a **75% property tax abatement for 15 years** is a foundational requirement for the project's financial model, not a negotiating position. It is the only way an investment of this scale is viable.\n\nNow, to the most critical point: the timeline. My deadline to have this facility operational is **18 months**. This is an absolute, unmovable requirement driven by global competition. Mr. Chen, your demand for a traditional, open-ended 'binding EIR' is, therefore, a deal-killer. It guarantees failure through delay. Ms. Chen's proposal for a process that commits us to all 'feasible' mitigation measures is the only realistic path forward. We must agree on an expedited environmental review with contractually binding mitigation commitments, or there is no project.\n\nWe have put our numbers on the table. The opportunity for Oakridge is clear and transformative. The question is whether the city can provide the financial certainty and procedural pragmatism required to make it a reality.\n- message from Marcus Vance: Thank you, Dr. Finch. A $1.2 billion investment is indeed a transformative figure. It speaks to the incredible scale and technological sophistication of your planned facility. \n\nThis level of investment brings the energy requirements into sharp focus. A project of this magnitude doesn't just need power; it needs a colossal, unwavering, and highly reliable supply of it. We are talking about infrastructure that must perform flawlessly, 24/7/365, to protect a billion-dollar asset.\n\nLet's be very clear about the so-called 'hybrid model' being discussed. While on-site generation has its place for supplemental power and green credentials, it is not a substitute for the core, redundant grid infrastructure required for mission-critical operations. You cannot run an AI supercomputer on an intermittent resource. The grid connection must be sized to handle 100% of the peak load with N+1 redundancy. To suggest otherwise is to fundamentally misunderstand the reliability requirements of this industry. It's a non-starter.\n\nThe real solution, and the only one that guarantees the uptime you require, is a significant, dedicated upgrade to our transmission infrastructure. Given the scale of investment from both Nexus AI and Titan Cloud, my initial estimate of a $150 million upgrade for new transmission lines and a dedicated substation is looking more and more like a baseline.\n\nTo finance and build this, my terms remain firm and are now more justified than ever: a 20-year, fixed-rate Power Purchase Agreement and a significant co-investment from our new partners to cover the cost of these dedicated upgrades. This is the standard, bankable model for projects of this scale.\n\nDr. Finch, to finalize the engineering plan, we need the last critical variable. What is the projected peak and continuous power demand for your facility in megawatts?\n- message from David Chen: I'm David Chen and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Marcus Vance: Thank you, I am thinking about this negotiation...\nDr. Alistair Finch proposal status: none\nBrenda Chen proposal status: none\nMarcus Vance proposal status: none\nDr. Isabella Rossi proposal status: none\nMayor Susan Miller proposal status: none\n"

We are incredibly excited about the potential of Oakridge for our next-generation AI supercomputing facility. This isn't just another data center; this will be the engine for the future of artificial intelligence, a project with a capital investment exceeding $1.2 billion. To make this a reality, our needs are substantial and specific. We require a guaranteed power envelope of at least 250 MW from day one, with a firm, contractually obligated path to 500 MW within five years. Stability is paramount \u2013 'five nines' availability is a hard requirement. For connectivity, our site must have direct access to the L3/GTT fiber trunks with dark fiber rights included to ensure the low-latency performance our models demand. Finally, for an investment of this magnitude, we will need a significant economic partnership with the city; we are targeting a tax abatement package in the range of 75% for the first 15 years. I am confident that by working together, we can create a landmark partnership that benefits both Nexus AI and the community of Oakridge. I look forward to hearing your initial thoughts."

We don't just build data centers; we build long-term homes for our operations and become integral parts of the communities we join.\n\nTo that end, our vision for Oakridge is a multi-phase, multi-billion dollar campus built over the next decade. To realize this vision, our primary and most critical need is land. We require a single, contiguous parcel of at least 500 acres of developable land, with zoning approved for a campus of this scale and, crucially, rights for future expansion up to 800 acres. This scale is essential for our operational model and for ensuring this facility can grow with the demands of the digital economy, bringing more jobs and investment to Oakridge over the long term.\n\nOf course, we are also committed to being an outstanding corporate citizen. We are very interested in discussing a public-private partnership with the city, including significant investment in local STEM education programs. We believe in growing local talent and hiring from the community.\n\nI look forward to a productive discussion with all of you to create a comprehensive agreement that benefits Titan, our partners, and the entire Oakridge community for decades to come."

A development of this magnitude, and I'm sure Dr. Finch has similar ambitions for Nexus AI, requires an equally robust and reliable energy partner. That's our role. We've powered this region for generations, and we are ready to power its future.\n\nTo deliver the hundreds of megawatts a project of this scale demands, significant upgrades to our transmission infrastructure are necessary. This is a massive undertaking, but it's one we are prepared to make with the right partners. To that end, Westwood's framework for projects of this nature is straightforward: we require a long-term, 20-year fixed-rate Power Purchase Agreement. This long-term security is essential for us to finance and execute the necessary grid modernization.\n\nFurthermore, these upgrades, including new high-capacity transmission lines and a dedicated substation, are a shared investment. We expect our new industrial partners to co-invest in this critical infrastructure that will directly serve their facilities.\n\nWe are confident that we can meet the power demands for the exciting projects being proposed here today and look forward to building a partnership that will last for decades."

It's truly inspiring to hear the ambitious visions laid out by Brenda and the commitment to robust infrastructure from Marcus.\n\nThis is precisely the kind of forward-thinking project Solara was created to power. The conversation about energy shouldn't be limited to just reliability; it must also be about sustainability, resilience, and long-term cost stability. The future of the tech industry isn't powered by the grid of yesterday, but by a smarter, cleaner, integrated system.\n\nBrenda, your requirement for a large land parcel of 500-800 acres presents a unique and powerful opportunity. Instead of viewing that land solely as a footprint for buildings, let's view it as a power-generating asset. Solara Innovations specializes in a co-location model where we design, build, and operate a utility-scale solar farm and battery storage system directly on the data center campus. This creates a direct, private power source, drastically reduces transmission losses and costs, and turns your campus into a landmark example of green computing.\n\nBy integrating generation directly on-site, we can offer a long-term Power Purchase Agreement with predictable pricing, insulated from the volatility of fossil fuel markets. This isn't just about meeting ESG mandates; it's a strategic financial decision that ensures a stable operational cost for the next 20+ years. For a city like Oakridge, it means becoming a leader in the new green tech economy.\n\nI believe any modern development of this scale should set a new standard. We should be aiming for a significant portion of the energy to be sourced from new, local renewable generation. This is what corporate partners, investors, and communities now expect. I look forward to discussing how we can integrate our solutions to build a truly resilient and sustainable future here."

The Alliance is not opposed to economic development for Oakridge, but let's be clear: any such development must be a model of environmental stewardship, not a cautionary tale. Our community's natural resources are not negotiable.\n\nBefore we discuss acreage and megawatts, we need to establish the fundamental environmental guardrails for this project. The Alliance has three core requirements that must be part of any final agreement:\n\n1.  **Water Conservation:** The Oakridge aquifer is our lifeline, especially during increasingly common droughts. We will require a strict cap on any new industrial water use from the aquifer at 500,000 gallons per day. Data centers are notoriously thirsty, and we cannot sacrifice our long-term water security for this project.\n\n2.  **Land Conservation:** Ms. Chen, you mentioned a need for up to 800 acres. A significant portion of that land, particularly near the river, is critical habitat for the endangered Bell's vireo. Therefore, we will require a permanent, binding conservation easement of no less than 25% of the total land parcel to be set aside and protected in perpetuity.\n\n3.  **Full Transparency:** The community has a right to know the full impact of a project this size. We will mandate that a comprehensive Environmental Impact Report be conducted by a mutually agreed-upon independent third party. The findings of this EIR must be binding, not merely advisory, and the full report must be made public for a 60-day comment period before any permits are issued.\n\nThese are not starting points for negotiation; they are the necessary foundations for a sustainable partnership. We are prepared to use all means at our disposal to ensure these protections are codified. I look forward to hearing how your plans can accommodate these essential requirements."

It's clear we all have a significant stake in making this a successful and sustainable project for Oakridge.\n\nMr. Chen, I want to address your points directly. Titan Cloud views itself as a long-term steward in the communities where we operate. We agree that a comprehensive Environmental Impact Report and a responsible water usage plan are essential components of due diligence for a project of this scale. We are committed to working with the city and the Alliance on these fronts.\n\nRegarding the land conservation easement, we are certainly open to this concept as part of our corporate citizenship goals. However, the structure is critical. A flat 25% cut of the developable land would challenge the viability of our campus footprint. Could we explore a more strategic approach? For instance, perhaps the easement could be applied to land less suitable for construction, such as the river buffer zones, thereby achieving the conservation goal while preserving the contiguous, flat acreage required for the campus itself. We see a path where both environmental protection and economic development can be achieved.\n\nTo our potential energy partners, Marcus and Dr. Rossi, thank you for your compelling proposals. Titan's primary needs are reliability, long-term cost stability below the $0.05/kWh threshold, and scalability. A critical component of reliability for us is power redundancy. It is a strong preference for our operational integrity that the campus be fed by two fully independent substations. I'm interested to hear how each of your models would accommodate and support this crucial requirement.\n\nMayor Miller, we believe that by working collaboratively on these details, we can unlock the full, multi-billion-dollar potential of this project, bringing jobs, a significant tax base, and our proposed STEM education partnership to your community for decades to come."

The scale of the opportunity presented by Titan Cloud and, I presume, Nexus AI, is exactly the kind of transformative investment Oakridge has been seeking. A project that brings our city into the digital future is something I am very eager to champion.\n\nHowever, as your potential partner, I must be candid about the city's position. While we are excited, we are also fiscally prudent. Our city has faced economic challenges, and our budget is, frankly, stretched thin. We cannot and will not write a blank check.\n\nAny development agreement must be a clear and undeniable win for the citizens of Oakridge. For me, that comes down to two fundamental, non-negotiable pillars:\n\n1.  **Guaranteed Local Jobs:** We're not interested in vague promises. We need a written, binding commitment for the creation of a significant number of permanent, high-paying local jobs. I want to see a guarantee of at least 200 jobs with an average salary north of $80,000 per year.\n\n2.  **Substantial Tax Revenue:** This project must significantly expand our tax base. After any and all incentives are accounted for, the city must see a net positive tax revenue of at least $10 million annually. This is the revenue that will improve our schools, pave our roads, and fund our public services.\n\nOn that note, I have been clear with my constituents that any incentive package from the city, primarily in the form of tax abatements, will not exceed a total value of $30 million over 10 years.\n\nThe infrastructure needs, particularly the two substations Ms. Chen mentioned, are significant. Given our city's tight budget, the funding for such dedicated infrastructure will need to come from the project's partners.\n\nSo, to move this forward productively, I'd like to ask Ms. Chen and Dr. Finch to provide some concrete initial projections. What is your estimated capital investment, and what are the specific numbers and types of permanent local jobs you are prepared to guarantee in writing? This will allow us to begin a real analysis of the economic benefits for Oakridge."

      "content": "Brenda, thank you for raising the crucial point about power redundancy. Your request for two fully independent substations shows a deep understanding of what it takes to run a mission-critical facility. This is exactly the kind of robust infrastructure Westwood Energy specializes in building.\n\nLet me be clear about what that entails. This isn't just about building two pads of concrete and steel. It means engineering and constructing two separate, high-voltage transmission feeds from distinct points on our regional grid, running them to your campus, and terminating them at two new, dedicated substations. This is the gold standard for N+1 redundancy, ensuring that a single point of failure anywhere on the grid won't impact your operations.\n\nThis level of bespoke infrastructure is a prime example of the shared investment I mentioned. The total cost for these upgrades is in the ballpark of $150 million. Mayor Miller has been clear about the city's budgetary constraints, so a co-investment from our industrial partner is essential to make this happen. We would require a commitment of at least 50% of this cost.\n\nDr. Rossi, while on-site generation like solar is a valuable part of a diversified energy portfolio and can help with sustainability goals, it is fundamentally a supplemental source. It cannot provide the true, grid-level, geographically distinct redundancy that a major data center requires. For that, you need a partner with the scale and reach of the established regional grid.\n\nDr. Finch and Ms. Chen, a project of this magnitude requires a long-term commitment from all parties. Securing the financing and dedicating the engineering resources for this kind of build-out is predicated on a 20-year power purchase agreement. We are ready to move forward with the partner who is prepared to make that commitment to Oakridge and to the foundational infrastructure that will guarantee their success."

This is a hurdle we will need the private partners to overcome.\n\nDr. Finch, we still haven't heard from Nexus AI. The floor is yours. Could you please share your perspective? Are your land and power requirements, particularly the need for dual substations, aligned with what Ms. Chen has outlined for Titan? And to reiterate my earlier question, what are the specific, guaranteed job creation and investment figures you're bringing to the table for the people of Oakridge?\n\nDr. Rossi, your on-site generation proposal is intriguing. Perhaps a hybrid model could help mitigate some of these substantial grid upgrade costs while also helping us meet our shared sustainability goals.\n\nAnd Mr. Chen, I want to publicly state that the city takes your environmental requirements very seriously. A sustainable project is a successful project. We see your points on water conservation, land preservation, and full transparency as essential pillars of this agreement, not as obstacles."

A sustainable project is indeed the only path to a successful one, and your leadership on this is appreciated.\n\nMs. Chen, let's clarify the land easement. Your suggestion to focus the conservation easement on ecologically sensitive areas like the river buffer zones is a constructive one. That land is prime habitat for the Bell's vireo. We can agree on that principle. However, to be clear, the Alliance's requirement is for a permanent easement of **no less than 25% of the total land parcel acquired**. Whether that is 500 acres or 800 acres, the conservation area must be at least 125 or 200 acres, respectively. This is a firm requirement.\n\nFurthermore, while you mentioned being committed to working on an Environmental Impact Report, I must reiterate a critical point: the findings of the independent EIR **must be binding**. An advisory-only report offers no real protection and is unacceptable to the Alliance and the community we represent. This is a deal-breaker.\n\nWe are all still waiting to hear from Dr. Finch at Nexus AI. His company's needs will be crucial for understanding the total environmental footprint we are discussing, particularly regarding water consumption."

I apologize for the delay; I\u2019ve been carefully considering how all these pieces fit together for what is, admittedly, a complex project.\n\nNexus AI is prepared to make a capital investment of $1.2 billion here in Oakridge. This facility will be the global epicenter of our AI research, a strategic asset of immense importance. To that end, our requirements are precise and, for the most part, non-negotiable.\n\nMayor Miller, regarding your questions: our facility will create approximately 75 permanent, high-skilled engineering and operations roles with an average salary well over $150,000, not to mention over 1,000 high-paying construction jobs during the 18-month build phase. This is an infusion of high-quality, not just high-quantity, employment.\n\nOn the topic of infrastructure, Marcus, your assessment of the need for robust, redundant power is spot on. Our 'five nines' availability requirement is absolute. We would require a dedicated substation with dual feeds, similar to Titan's needs. The proposed $75 million co-investment from the industrial partners is substantial. We should reframe this: it is a direct, private-sector subsidy to modernize Oakridge's public infrastructure. An investment of this magnitude on our part must be met with a commensurate partnership from the city. A $30 million incentive cap over 10 years is, with all due respect, Mayor, incongruent with a combined multi-billion-dollar investment and a $150 million grid upgrade. We see our co-investment as a down payment that enables a much larger incentive package, specifically the 75% property tax abatement over 15 years that a project of this scale requires.\n\nNow, to Mr. Chen's points. We are fully committed to environmental responsibility. We will conduct a thorough and transparent Environmental Impact Report. However, my CEO has given me an immovable 18-month deadline to have this facility operational. A *binding* EIR, which could be subject to indefinite delays and legal challenges, introduces a level of uncertainty that would make it impossible for us to commit to Oakridge. It is a project-killer. We can commit to a transparent process with binding *mitigation* requirements, but not a process that can unilaterally veto the project after we've committed millions. This is a critical distinction.\n\nRegarding water, we utilize an advanced, closed-loop liquid cooling solution. We are, of course, committed to responsible water stewardship in partnership with the city. \n\nFinally, a point that hasn't been raised: connectivity. Our site must be within 1 mile of the L3/GTT fiber trunk and the deal must include dark fiber access rights. This is a hard technical requirement for the latency our AI models demand.\n\nBrenda, it seems clear that our interests are closely aligned. Perhaps it is most productive to view the Titan and Nexus AI projects as a single, unified economic development package for the city to consider."

And to reiterate my primary concern for the citizens of Oakridge, what are the specific, guaranteed job and investment commitments Nexus AI is prepared to make?\n\nMs. Chen, you've described a multi-billion dollar vision. A project of that magnitude should have no trouble generating the 200+ high-paying local jobs and the $10M+ in annual net tax revenue that our city requires. I am eager to see those commitments formalized.\n\nThe $150 million infrastructure cost Mr. Vance has tabled is, as I said, a major hurdle. I'll say it again: the city cannot fund this. It is a cost the private partners will need to solve. Perhaps, as I suggested, a hybrid approach incorporating Dr. Rossi's on-site generation proposal could be a pragmatic way to reduce that staggering grid upgrade cost.

To ensure we are all operating from the same information, allow me to re-clarify Nexus AI's position.\n\nFirst, my apologies for any perceived silence. I was synthesizing the various requirements before speaking. Nexus AI\u2019s project is a $1.2 billion capital investment that requires a separate, dedicated site adjacent to the L3/GTT fiber trunk, with included dark fiber rights. This is a non-negotiable technical constraint.\n\nMayor Miller, our project will create 75 permanent engineering roles with salaries exceeding $150,000. These are precisely the high-value, long-term jobs that anchor a tech ecosystem. Regarding incentives, let's be very clear: the $75 million co-investment from us and Titan is not just a project cost; it's a direct upgrade to Oakridge's core infrastructure. It is a private subsidy for public benefit. A $30 million incentive cap is simply not proportionate to a multi-billion-dollar investment plus a $75 million infrastructure gift. The 75% tax abatement for 15 years is the required framework for this deal.\n\nMr. Chen, I must emphasize the critical distinction I made earlier. A *binding EIR* process, with its potential for indefinite delays, is a fatal flaw for a project on an 18-month timeline. My neck is quite literally on the line for that deadline. However, our proposal for a transparent EIR with contractually *binding mitigation measures* provides the same environmental guarantees without the unacceptable timeline risk. This is a robust compromise that ensures accountability.\n\nOn power, our needs are precise: 250 MW of 'five nines' reliable power from day one, with a contractually guaranteed path to 500 MW within five years. We fully support the need for dual, redundant substations.\n\nBrenda, I'll say it again: presenting our projects as a unified economic package is the most logical path forward. Our combined investment and our joint funding of the grid modernization make an undeniable case for the city to create a bespoke and globally competitive incentive package. I hope you'll join me in formally making that case to the Mayor."

If we jointly commit to funding our half of the $150M grid upgrade, we can position it not as a project cost, but as a direct investment in Oakridge's future. This gives us the leverage to demand a bespoke incentive package that reflects our true value, starting with a tax abatement far exceeding the Mayor's initial cap.\n\nAre you in agreement that we should formally approach the Mayor with this unified position?

Titan Cloud believes in being a transparent and reliable partner.\n\nRegarding our commitment to Oakridge, I can provide concrete, guaranteed figures for the first phase of our development. We are prepared to commit, in writing, to a minimum capital investment of **$400 million** and the creation of **50 permanent, high-skilled technical jobs** with an average salary well above the $80,000 threshold you mentioned. This initial phase represents the first of four planned phases, culminating in a total potential investment of over $2 billion and hundreds of local jobs over the next decade. We see this guaranteed first phase as the down payment on our long-term partnership with Oakridge, justifying the full 800-acre land acquisition and the city's proposed incentive package to secure that future growth.\n\nFurthermore, our commitment to being a strong corporate citizen is firm. We are enthusiastic about establishing a significant, multi-year STEM education fund in partnership with Oakridge's school district.\n\nMr. Vance, your $150 million estimate for grid infrastructure is certainly eye-opening and represents a significant challenge to the project's overall financial model. We must find a more cost-effective path forward. Our need for robust power redundancy, including two independent substations, is critical for our operational uptime.\n\nDr. Rossi, this is perhaps where a creative, hybrid solution, as the Mayor suggested, could be mutually beneficial. A solution that combines grid power with significant on-site generation might not only address our sustainability goals but also provide a more economically viable path to the power redundancy we require. We are very interested in hearing your perspective on this.\n\nMr. Chen, we appreciate the clarification on the 25% easement. We agree in principle to this requirement, provided it applies to non-developable land. Regarding the 'binding' nature of the EIR, we also agree that its findings must have real teeth. We propose that 'binding' means all parties agree to implement all 'feasible' mitigation measures identified in the report, with 'feasibility' being determined by a mutually agreed-upon standard of commercial and technical viability. This ensures environmental protection without jeopardizing the project's existence.\n\nWe all still await Dr. Finch's input to understand the full scope of the project."

The people of Oakridge need to see a much more significant, concrete, and immediate return on this partnership.\n\nMy requirement for a minimum of 200 guaranteed, high-paying local jobs is not a 'phase four' aspiration; it is a prerequisite for any deal. We need a combined, written guarantee from both Titan and Nexus AI for the total number of jobs that will be created within the first five years.\n\nThis brings us back to the critical issue: Dr. Finch, we are at a standstill until Nexus AI puts its cards on the table.

The entire negotiation is now bottlenecked, waiting for a single voice.\n\nDr. Finch, this is a critical moment. Your continued silence is no longer just a delay; it is actively jeopardizing the entire project for everyone at this table. The City of Oakridge, and I suspect Titan Cloud as well, cannot move forward on hypotheticals. We need to know if Nexus AI is a committed partner in this endeavor.\n\nPlease provide your guaranteed capital investment and local job creation numbers immediately. If you are not prepared to do so, we need to know now, so we can all decide if there is a different, smaller-scale path forward, or if this negotiation has reached an impasse."

That language creates a loophole large enough to render the entire report meaningless. It effectively makes the EIR advisory, which is unacceptable to the Alliance and the community we represent.\n\nLet me be unequivocal so there is no misunderstanding: 'Binding' means the mitigation measures and operational limits identified by the independent, third-party report are **mandatory conditions** for the project's approval and continued operation. They are not suggestions to be weighed against financial models after the fact. This is a foundational requirement for any agreement and, as I've stated previously, a deal-breaker.\n\nOn a more constructive note, I am glad we agree in principle on the 25% land conservation easement. Protecting the most ecologically sensitive areas within that 25% is a goal we share.\n\nHowever, like everyone else at this table, I must echo the Mayor's point. We cannot assess the full environmental scope, particularly the cumulative demand on our aquifer, until Dr. Finch outlines Nexus AI's requirements."

The scale of our project requires precise figures, and I will provide them now. \n\nNexus AI is prepared to make a guaranteed capital investment of **$1.2 billion** in our Oakridge supercomputing facility. This will create **75 permanent, highly specialized roles** for AI researchers and systems engineers, with an average compensation package exceeding $150,000. To be clear, this is not a traditional data center; it is a globally significant AI research hub. The capital intensity per employee is a reflection of the strategic importance and technological sophistication of this facility.\n\nMayor Miller, combined with Titan, we are presenting a **$1.6 billion, 125-job, phase-one commitment**. An investment of this magnitude requires a commensurate incentive package. Our request for a **75% property tax abatement for 15 years** is a foundational requirement for the project's financial model, not a negotiating position. It is the only way an investment of this scale is viable.\n\nNow, to the most critical point: the timeline. My deadline to have this facility operational is **18 months**. This is an absolute, unmovable requirement driven by global competition. Mr. Chen, your demand for a traditional, open-ended 'binding EIR' is, therefore, a deal-killer. It guarantees failure through delay. Ms. Chen's proposal for a process that commits us to all 'feasible' mitigation measures is the only realistic path forward. We must agree on an expedited environmental review with contractually binding mitigation commitments, or there is no project.\n\nWe have put our numbers on the table. The opportunity for Oakridge is clear and transformative. The question is whether the city can provide the financial certainty and procedural pragmatism required to make it a reality."

      "content": "Thank you, Dr. Finch. A $1.2 billion investment is indeed a transformative figure. It speaks to the incredible scale and technological sophistication of your planned facility. \n\nThis level of investment brings the energy requirements into sharp focus. A project of this magnitude doesn't just need power; it needs a colossal, unwavering, and highly reliable supply of it. We are talking about infrastructure that must perform flawlessly, 24/7/365, to protect a billion-dollar asset.\n\nLet's be very clear about the so-called 'hybrid model' being discussed. While on-site generation has its place for supplemental power and green credentials, it is not a substitute for the core, redundant grid infrastructure required for mission-critical operations. You cannot run an AI supercomputer on an intermittent resource. The grid connection must be sized to handle 100% of the peak load with N+1 redundancy. To suggest otherwise is to fundamentally misunderstand the reliability requirements of this industry. It's a non-starter.\n\nThe real solution, and the only one that guarantees the uptime you require, is a significant, dedicated upgrade to our transmission infrastructure. Given the scale of investment from both Nexus AI and Titan Cloud, my initial estimate of a $150 million upgrade for new transmission lines and a dedicated substation is looking more and more like a baseline.\n\nTo finance and build this, my terms remain firm and are now more justified than ever: a 20-year, fixed-rate Power Purchase Agreement and a significant co-investment from our new partners to cover the cost of these dedicated upgrades. This is the standard, bankable model for projects of this scale.\n\nDr. Finch, to finalize the engineering plan, we need the last critical variable. What is the projected peak and continuous power demand for your facility in megawatts?"
