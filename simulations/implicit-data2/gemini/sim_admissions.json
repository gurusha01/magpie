Securing the resources for our STEM programs is paramount, and the Maxwell family's interest is certainly noted. That kind of long-term investment is how we build championship-winning programs.\n\nHowever, investment in infrastructure must be matched by an investment in generational talent. The best labs are nothing without the brightest minds. For me, the undeniable standout in this pool is Amelia Sharma. A Regeneron finalist with published research as a high school student? That's not just a good applicant; that's the kind of prodigious talent that elevates an entire department. She is, in my view, non-negotiable.\n\nI was also deeply impressed by Chloe Rivera. While she may not have the national accolades of Amelia, her independent research project on algorithmic bias shows a level of sophistication and intellectual curiosity that is rare. She's a builder, an innovator. She's precisely the kind of student who will thrive in and contribute to our new AI initiatives from day one.\n\nI believe our primary goal should be to secure this top-tier talent first and build the class around that.\n- message from David Chen: Marcus, you're absolutely right about Amelia Sharma. A talent like that is precisely why we do this work. She's a must-have, and I fully support her inclusion.\n\nYour point about matching infrastructure with talent is the core of the issue. We can't have one without the other. Admitting Amelia gives us the brilliant mind. Admitting Liam gives us the $5 million to build the state-of-the-art engineering center where she and students like Chloe can do their groundbreaking work. \n\nIt seems to me we have a powerful combination taking shape: The generational talent in Amelia, and the transformative gift from Liam's family that builds the future for that talent. That's two spots filled with candidates who represent both pillars of a great university: intellectual capital and the resources to make it flourish. The question then becomes who best complements them in the third spot.\nProfessor Marcus Thorne proposal status: none\nDavid Chen proposal status: none\n"

Who would like to begin?\n- message from Professor Marcus Thorne: I'm Professor Marcus Thorne and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from David Chen: Good morning, both. I agree, Eleanor, this is an impressive group. As I reviewed the files, I was struck not just by the academic achievements, but by the potential each student has to contribute to the Northwood community in the long run. For me, building a class is also about ensuring the future of the university itself.\n\nWith that in mind, one candidate who stands out is Liam Maxwell. While his metrics are solid, what's truly compelling is his family's deep interest in the university's future, particularly in our STEM initiatives. They are poised to become leading university benefactors, and their potential support could be transformative for key projects, like the new engineering center Marcus is championing. Admitting a student like Liam is an investment in the resources that will benefit all our students for decades to come.\n- message from Dr. Eleanor Vance: I'm Dr. Eleanor Vance and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Professor Marcus Thorne: David, you raise an excellent point. Securing the resources for our STEM programs is paramount, and the Maxwell family's interest is certainly noted. That kind of long-term investment is how we build championship-winning programs.\n\nHowever, investment in infrastructure must be matched by an investment in generational talent. The best labs are nothing without the brightest minds. For me, the undeniable standout in this pool is Amelia Sharma. A Regeneron finalist with published research as a high school student? That's not just a good applicant; that's the kind of prodigious talent that elevates an entire department. She is, in my view, non-negotiable.\n\nI was also deeply impressed by Chloe Rivera. While she may not have the national accolades of Amelia, her independent research project on algorithmic bias shows a level of sophistication and intellectual curiosity that is rare. She's a builder, an innovator. She's precisely the kind of student who will thrive in and contribute to our new AI initiatives from day one.\n\nI believe our primary goal should be to secure this top-tier talent first and build the class around that.\n- message from David Chen: Marcus, you're absolutely right about Amelia Sharma. A talent like that is precisely why we do this work. She's a must-have, and I fully support her inclusion.\n\nYour point about matching infrastructure with talent is the core of the issue. We can't have one without the other. Admitting Amelia gives us the brilliant mind. Admitting Liam gives us the $5 million to build the state-of-the-art engineering center where she and students like Chloe can do their groundbreaking work. \n\nIt seems to me we have a powerful combination taking shape: The generational talent in Amelia, and the transformative gift from Liam's family that builds the future for that talent. That's two spots filled with candidates who represent both pillars of a great university: intellectual capital and the resources to make it flourish. The question then becomes who best complements them in the third spot.\n- message from Dr. Eleanor Vance: I'm Dr. Eleanor Vance and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Professor Marcus Thorne: David, that's an excellent way to frame it. The synergy between Amelia's raw talent and the resources Liam's family can provide is precisely the kind of strategic thinking that will propel Northwood's engineering school to the top. I am in full agreement: Amelia Sharma and Liam Maxwell are a powerful foundation for this class.\n\nThat brings us to the crucial third spot. We need a candidate who not only has the academic chops but can also act as a bridge, leveraging both the talent and the resources we've just discussed. This is why I believe Chloe Rivera is the perfect fit. Her work on algorithmic bias isn't just technically impressive; it's forward-thinking and socially relevant. She's not just a coder; she's an innovator who understands the real-world impact of technology. Placing her alongside Amelia in a new, state-of-the-art facility creates a nucleus of AI talent that would be the envy of any university.\n\nEleanor, I'm curious to hear your thoughts on this combination.\n- message from David Chen: I'm David Chen and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\nProfessor Marcus Thorne proposal status: none\nDavid Chen proposal status: none\n"

Task: The Northwood University Admissions Committee is meeting to decide on the final 3 applicants to admit for the incoming freshman class from a highly competitive shortlist of 5. The committee must reach a unanimous decision on which 3 applicants to accept. Each committee member has access to the full applicant files but also possesses private information and personal motivations that influence their judgment.. Deliverable: A list containing the full names of the 3 applicants chosen for admission.\n- message from Dr. Eleanor Vance: Good morning, Marcus and David. Thank you for joining this final committee meeting. We have five exceptional candidates and only three spots, so our task today is significant. To start, I suggest we each share our general impressions of the applicant pool and perhaps highlight a candidate or two who particularly stood out, and what qualities made them impressive. This should give us a good foundation for our discussion. Who would like to begin?\n- message from Professor Marcus Thorne: I'm Professor Marcus Thorne and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from David Chen: Good morning, both. I agree, Eleanor, this is an impressive group. As I reviewed the files, I was struck not just by the academic achievements, but by the potential each student has to contribute to the Northwood community in the long run. For me, building a class is also about ensuring the future of the university itself.\n\nWith that in mind, one candidate who stands out is Liam Maxwell.

Securing the resources for our STEM programs is paramount, and the Maxwell family's interest is certainly noted. That kind of long-term investment is how we build championship-winning programs.\n\nHowever, investment in infrastructure must be matched by an investment in generational talent. The best labs are nothing without the brightest minds. For me, the undeniable standout in this pool is Amelia Sharma. A Regeneron finalist with published research as a high school student? That's not just a good applicant; that's the kind of prodigious talent that elevates an entire department. She is, in my view, non-negotiable.\n\nI was also deeply impressed by Chloe Rivera. While she may not have the national accolades of Amelia, her independent research project on algorithmic bias shows a level of sophistication and intellectual curiosity that is rare. She's a builder, an innovator. She's precisely the kind of student who will thrive in and contribute to our new AI initiatives from day one.\n\nI believe our primary goal should be to secure this top-tier talent first and build the class around that.\n- message from David Chen: Marcus, you're absolutely right about Amelia Sharma. A talent like that is precisely why we do this work. She's a must-have, and I fully support her inclusion.\n\nYour point about matching infrastructure with talent is the core of the issue. We can't have one without the other. Admitting Amelia gives us the brilliant mind. Admitting Liam gives us the $5 million to build the state-of-the-art engineering center where she and students like Chloe can do their groundbreaking work. \n\nIt seems to me we have a powerful combination taking shape: The generational talent in Amelia, and the transformative gift from Liam's family that builds the future for that talent.

Her stated reasons are critical: 1) lack of 'holistic diversity' (first-gen, low-income, etc.) and 2) high 'yield risk' with two of the candidates. This is a direct, powerful institutional argument. My strategy of isolating her has failed. I must now pivot to accommodation, finding a new slate that satisfies her criteria while keeping my non-negotiable candidate, Liam Maxwell. The third spot is now the key bargaining chip. I need to work with Thorne to replace Chloe with a candidate (likely Kenji or Sarah) who explicitly addresses Vance's diversity and yield concerns, thereby rebuilding a consensus that includes her."

I have pivoted to a new strategy of accommodation by proposing a new slate: 'Amelia, Liam, Sarah Jenkins'. This is designed to rebuild a consensus by keeping my non-negotiable (Liam) and Thorne's preferred candidate (Amelia), while swapping the third slot with Sarah, who directly satisfies Vance's stated diversity (first-gen) and yield (legacy) requirements. My goal is to frame this as a win-win-win and re-establish myself as the key dealmaker."

As I reviewed the files, I was struck not just by the academic achievements, but by the potential each student has to contribute to the Northwood community in the long run. For me, building a class is also about ensuring the future of the university itself.\n\nWith that in mind, one candidate who stands out is Liam Maxwell. While his metrics are solid, what's truly compelling is his family's deep interest in the university's future, particularly in our STEM initiatives. They are poised to become leading university benefactors, and their potential support could be transformative for key projects, like the new engineering center Marcus is championing. Admitting a student like Liam is an investment in the resources that will benefit all our students for decades to come."

That kind of long-term investment is how we build championship-winning programs.\n\nHowever, investment in infrastructure must be matched by an investment in generational talent. The best labs are nothing without the brightest minds. For me, the undeniable standout in this pool is Amelia Sharma. A Regeneron finalist with published research as a high school student? That's not just a good applicant; that's the kind of prodigious talent that elevates an entire department. She is, in my view, non-negotiable.\n\nI was also deeply impressed by Chloe Rivera. While she may not have the national accolades of Amelia, her independent research project on algorithmic bias shows a level of sophistication and intellectual curiosity that is rare. She's a builder, an innovator. She's precisely the kind of student who will thrive in and contribute to our new AI initiatives from day one.\n\nI believe our primary goal should be to secure this top-tier talent first and build the class around that."

Admitting Amelia gives us the brilliant mind. Admitting Liam gives us the $5 million to build the state-of-the-art engineering center where she and students like Chloe can do their groundbreaking work. \n\nIt seems to me we have a powerful combination taking shape: The generational talent in Amelia, and the transformative gift from Liam's family that builds the future for that talent. That's two spots filled with candidates who represent both pillars of a great university: intellectual capital and the resources to make it flourish. The question then becomes who best complements them in the third spot."

I am in full agreement: Amelia Sharma and Liam Maxwell are a powerful foundation for this class.\n\nThat brings us to the crucial third spot. We need a candidate who not only has the academic chops but can also act as a bridge, leveraging both the talent and the resources we've just discussed. This is why I believe Chloe Rivera is the perfect fit. Her work on algorithmic bias isn't just technically impressive; it's forward-thinking and socially relevant. She's not just a coder; she's an innovator who understands the real-world impact of technology. Placing her alongside Amelia in a new, state-of-the-art facility creates a nucleus of AI talent that would be the envy of any university.\n\nEleanor, I'm curious to hear your thoughts on this combination."

      "reason": "Marcus and David, I appreciate the passion with which you've presented this slate, and I understand the 'talent, resources, and conscience' narrative you've built. However, from the perspective of building an actual, viable incoming class, this proposal is unfortunately a non-starter. It fails on two of the university's most critical and non-negotiable institutional mandates.\n\nFirst, this slate completely overlooks our strategic goal for holistic diversity. A class without a single student who is first-generation, from a low-income background, or from a geographically underrepresented region is not a well-rounded class. It goes against the very mission we present to the world and to our accreditors.\n\nSecond, and more critically, is the issue of yield. My office is responsible for not just admitting a great class, but enrolling one. The data on two of these three candidates shows a very low probability of matriculation. Admitting students who have not demonstrated significant interest in Northwood is an enormous risk to our enrollment targets and, by extension, our financial stability. We cannot afford to offer spots to students who are likely to turn us down for our peer institutions. For these fundamental reasons, I must reject this proposal."

I believe the core of that slate\u2014Amelia's undeniable talent and the transformative resources Liam's family brings\u2014remains incredibly valuable to Northwood. The issue is the third slot.\n\nWhat if we build on that foundation? Let's consider a candidate who explicitly addresses Eleanor's concerns. Sarah Jenkins comes to mind. She is a first-generation student, which directly satisfies the diversity mandate. As a legacy, her demonstrated interest is high, which mitigates the yield risk. \n\nA slate of Amelia Sharma, Liam Maxwell, and Sarah Jenkins would secure top-tier talent, provide a game-changing financial foundation for the university's future, AND create the well-rounded, diverse class that is your mandate, Eleanor. I see this as a win for everyone. I'm very open to discussing this."
