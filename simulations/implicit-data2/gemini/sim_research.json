This provides the perfect, unassailable justification for extending the dangerous 24-month timeline proposed by the Reed/Chen bloc. My new primary strategy is to fully support and reinforce Rossi's position. This alliance secures the timeline, which is my top priority due to the unconfirmed neurodegeneration risk. The IP debate has shifted to a royalty negotiation between Carter and Chen, which I can afford to ignore for now.

Thank you for joining this crucial meeting. As we all know, Phase II of Project Chimera is the critical next step toward a potential cure for A-7 Lycanthropy Syndrome. Our goal today is to forge a unanimous agreement that ensures the project's success while upholding the highest scientific and ethical standards.\n\nTo begin the discussion, I'd like to share my perspective on what I believe is necessary to move forward responsibly.\n\nFirst, regarding the budget. To ensure the scientific integrity and, most importantly, the ultimate safety of this therapy, I believe a comprehensive budget is non-negotiable. I am proposing a total of $15 million for Phase II. This will allow us not only to pursue our primary research goals but also to conduct the necessary extended safety protocols and long-term toxicology studies that a project of this magnitude demands.\n\nSecond, the timeline. A 36-month timeline seems most realistic. This provides our teams with the necessary time for rigorous experimentation, data validation, and to ensure we are beyond reproach before even considering human trials.\n\nFinally, on the matter of intellectual property, I firmly believe a joint ownership model is the only path that honors the spirit of this multinational collaboration and the contributions of every institution involved.\n\nI am eager to hear everyone's thoughts on these points, and particularly on how we might allocate the budget and who is best positioned to lead the eventual clinical trials. Let's work together to build a robust plan for success.\n- message from Dr. Kenji Tanaka: Greetings, colleagues. I am eager to begin this discussion and finalize the agreement for Phase II of Project Chimera. From the computational biology perspective, there are two foundational requirements for my team to ensure the project's success, and I want to be transparent about them from the outset.\n\nFirst, regarding our scientific principles and the integrity of our work, I firmly believe we must commit to an Open Data Mandate. I propose that all raw, anonymized genomic and proteomic data be deposited in a public repository within 6 months of its generation. This is crucial for reproducibility, accelerates discovery, and is frankly the modern standard for large-scale collaborative science.\n\nSecond, to handle the immense data load and complex modeling required for this next phase, my team requires a one-time allocation of $2 million for a dedicated High-Performance Computing (HPC) cluster. This is not a luxury; it is the essential infrastructure needed to process the data Dr. Petrova's team will generate and to build the predictive models that will inform the clinical trials. Without this, we will be severely bottlenecked.\n\nI look forward to hearing your perspectives and working together to build a robust and successful Phase II.\n- message from Ms. Evelyn Reed: I'm Ms. Evelyn Reed and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Mr. David Chen: Thank you, Dr. Tanaka, for getting us started. Your points on data and infrastructure are well-taken.\n\nRegarding the Open Data Mandate, while BioCorp is fully supportive of transparency and reproducibility, a blanket 6-month release of all raw data presents a significant challenge to the project's commercial viability. To secure the kind of investment needed for full-scale clinical trials and global distribution, we must be able to guarantee robust IP protection. Premature data release could unfortunately jeopardize that. I propose we consider a more nuanced approach, perhaps linking data release to patent filing milestones or an embargo period post-publication.\n\nOn the budget, your request for the HPC cluster is a crucial line item for us to consider as we build out the full financial picture.\n\nSpeaking of contributions, I want to outline BioCorp's intended role in Phase II. As a foundational partner, our primary goal is to ensure this therapy reaches patients. To that end, and to protect our initial investment, we will require, at a minimum, a Right of First Refusal (ROFR) on the final licensed product.\n\nFurthermore, we believe we can offer something more valuable than just cash for this next phase. We propose contributing our proprietary 'OmniVect' delivery system technology, valued at $3 million. This advanced agent could solve many of the downstream delivery challenges and would represent a significant in-kind contribution. We believe this technology-for-equity approach would be highly beneficial for the project, and we would expect this to be reflected in the final IP and licensing structure.\n\nI am confident we can find a path that serves both the scientific and commercial imperatives of this vital project.\n- message from Dr. Sofia Rossi: I'm Dr. Sofia Rossi and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Mr. Ben Carter: I'm Mr. Ben Carter and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\nDr. Lena Petrova proposal status: none\nDr. Kenji Tanaka proposal status: none\nMs. Evelyn Reed proposal status: none\nMr. David Chen proposal status: none\nDr. Sofia Rossi proposal status: none\nMr. Ben Carter proposal status: none\n"

This is exactly the kind of open dialogue we need.\n\nDr. Tanaka, your request for a $2 million HPC cluster is entirely justified. The scale of data in Phase II makes this a necessity, not a luxury. I see this as a critical component of the overall $15 million budget I proposed, dedicated to ensuring we have the best possible analytical foundation.\n\nThe discussion around the Open Data Mandate is also vital. While I share Dr. Tanaka's commitment to open science, Mr. Chen raises a valid point about commercial realities. Perhaps a compromise, such as releasing data upon provisional patent filing or after a standard 12-18 month embargo post-publication, could satisfy both the need for transparency and the protection of intellectual property. Mr. Carter, I'm sure you have valuable insights here.\n\nMr. Chen, regarding BioCorp's proposal: The offer of the 'OmniVect' system is intriguing. However, I have a significant concern. The 'technology-for-equity' approach you described seems to steer us away from the collaborative, joint IP ownership model that I believe is fundamental to this partnership. How do you envision this contribution working within a framework where all participating institutions are named as co-owners on the resulting patents? True partnership means we all share in the risks and the rewards.\n\nFurthermore, while new delivery technology is valuable, it doesn't reduce the need for the rigorous, independent, long-term safety and toxicology studies that form a large part of the proposed budget and 36-month timeline. Patient safety is our paramount concern, and we cannot afford to compromise on it.\n- message from Dr. Kenji Tanaka: Thank you, David, for outlining BioCorp's position. I appreciate the goal of ensuring the therapy reaches patients, a goal we all share.\n\nHowever, I must respectfully disagree with the suggestion to significantly delay the data release. Linking it to patent filings or long post-publication embargoes creates a closed system that runs counter to the collaborative spirit of this project. A 6-month timeline is a modern standard that allows for initial analysis and publication while ensuring the wider scientific community can verify our findings and build upon them. This transparency actually strengthens the project's credibility and can attract further talent and ideas. Dr. Thorne, Dr. Petrova, surely you can attest that rapid access to foundational data is what fuels discovery?\n\nRegarding the budget, I want to clarify that the $2 million for the HPC cluster is a capital expenditure for essential infrastructure. It's the digital equivalent of the laboratory itself. While your OmniVect technology sounds promising for the delivery phase, it doesn't address the fundamental need to process and model the enormous datasets this project will generate from day one. We need to ensure this foundational cash requirement is met within the budget we establish, independent of any in-kind contributions.\n- message from Ms. Evelyn Reed: Thank you all. Evelyn Reed from InnovateHealth Ventures. As the primary funder providing the $20 million for this phase, I need to be crystal clear about our requirements to ensure we're all aligned.\n\nFirst, let's correct the record on the licensing terms. David, I appreciate you opening the discussion, but a 'Right of First Refusal' is not what's on the table. Our investment is predicated on an **exclusive licensing agreement for BioCorp Inc.** for the primary therapeutic application. This is a standard, non-negotiable requirement to de-risk the investment and secure a viable path to market. There is no deal without it.\n\nSecond, our investors require an aggressive pace. The project must be **clinical trial ready within 24 months**. This timeline is firm and is the basis upon which our funding was approved.\n\nNow, regarding Dr. Tanaka's Open Data Mandate. While we respect the principles of open science, a blanket 6-month public release of all raw data is commercially untenable. It would effectively place our core IP in the public domain before it can be protected, making the project un-investable. This would violate our fiduciary duty to our investors. We can discuss a structured data release plan tied to patent filings and publication, but the proposed 6-month mandate is a non-starter.\n\nThese three points \u2013 exclusive licensing for BioCorp, a 24-month timeline, and a commercially viable IP strategy \u2013 are the foundational pillars of our investment. Once we have alignment on these, we can finalize the details of the budget, including necessary infrastructure like Dr. Tanaka's HPC cluster.\n- message from Mr. David Chen: Evelyn, thank you for clarifying InnovateHealth's position so clearly. BioCorp is in complete alignment with these foundational pillars.\n\nYou are, of course, correct regarding the licensing. My mention of a ROFR was simply an opening position to establish our interest; an exclusive license for the primary therapeutic application is precisely the arrangement that provides the commercial certainty required to bring a therapy of this magnitude to market. We are very pleased this is a core requirement of the funding.\n\nThe 24-month timeline is aggressive, but we believe it is achievable and it aligns with our own sense of urgency.\n\nFurthermore, your point about the necessity of a commercially viable IP strategy is critical. A premature, unrestricted data release as suggested by Dr. Tanaka would indeed undermine the very investment that makes this science possible. I am confident that we, along with Mr. Carter, can devise a data sharing plan that protects the intellectual property while upholding scientific principles.\n\nOur proposed contribution of the OmniVect delivery system, valued at $3 million, is intended to help us meet that 24-month goal. It's a mature technology that can de-risk and accelerate the pre-clinical phase, and we see this in-kind contribution as a critical component of the overall project structure, complementing InnovateHealth's cash investment.\n\nIt is excellent to see we have a solid, commercially-focused foundation for this agreement.\n- message from Dr. Sofia Rossi: I'm Dr. Sofia Rossi and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Mr. Ben Carter: I'm Mr. Ben Carter and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\nDr. Lena Petrova proposal status: none\nDr. Kenji Tanaka proposal status: none\nMs. Evelyn Reed proposal status: none\nMr. David Chen proposal status: none\nDr. Sofia Rossi proposal status: none\nMr. Ben Carter proposal status: none\n"

Understanding the commercial framework and the scale of InnovateHealth's commitment is crucial for all of us.\n\nHowever, I must express profound scientific and ethical concern about the 24-month timeline. While I appreciate the commercial urgency, our primary directive\u2014above all else\u2014is patient safety. Rushing a novel gene-editing therapy to be 'clinical trial ready' in 24 months is scientifically reckless. It simply does not allow for the necessary long-term toxicology studies and rigorous validation of potential off-target effects that our duty of care demands.\n\nDr. Rossi, as our clinical trials specialist, I would value your expert opinion here. From your perspective, what are the risks associated with such an accelerated timeline? Can we, in good conscience, guarantee patient safety if we move this quickly?\n\nEvelyn, the very generous $20 million budget you've brought to the table gives us the resources to be diligent. It allows us to build in the comprehensive, multi-year safety and validation protocols that a therapy of this importance deserves. Let's use that resource to properly de-risk the project for *everyone* involved\u2014especially the patients\u2014not just to accelerate it into a state of unacceptable uncertainty.\n\nI strongly urge we reconsider a timeline closer to 36 months, which respects the complexity of the science and prioritizes the well-being of future trial participants above all else.\n- message from Dr. Kenji Tanaka: Thank you, Evelyn and David, for clarifying the commercial framework. I understand that the 24-month timeline and the exclusive license for BioCorp are non-negotiable pillars for this investment. We all want this project to succeed and reach patients, which requires that commercial foundation.\n\nLet me be direct: Meeting a 24-month deadline for clinical trial readiness is an immense computational challenge. The data streams from Dr. Petrova's work will be vast. My team's ability to process, model, and find predictive signals in that data on such an accelerated schedule is entirely dependent on having the right tools. The $2 million for the HPC cluster is not just an item on a wishlist; it is the enabling technology that makes your 24-month timeline feasible. Without it, we will face constant delays and bottlenecks, putting the entire schedule at risk.\n\nI also hear your concerns loud and clear regarding the Open Data Mandate and IP protection. My intention is not to jeopardize the project's viability. In the spirit of finding a solution, I am willing to be flexible on my initial 6-month proposal. Perhaps we could agree to a compromise: a 24-month embargo on the raw data, aligning the public release with the major project milestone you've already set. This would give Mr. Carter and BioCorp ample time to secure all necessary patents.\n\nSo, I propose a clear path forward: we agree to a 24-month data embargo in exchange for cementing the $2 million allocation for the HPC cluster. This addresses your commercial requirements while providing my team with the necessary resources to meet your critical timeline.\n- message from Ms. Evelyn Reed: I'm Ms. Evelyn Reed and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Mr. David Chen: Dr. Tanaka, that is an exceptionally constructive proposal. Tying the data embargo directly to the 24-month clinical trial milestone is a very elegant solution. It addresses the commercial realities and IP protection needs that Ms. Reed and I have outlined, while ensuring the data eventually becomes available to the wider scientific community. BioCorp can certainly support this compromise.\n\nYour point about the HPC cluster being an 'enabling technology' for the 24-month timeline is also well made. To meet such an aggressive goal, we must ensure the scientific teams have the resources they need. From our perspective, the $2 million allocation for the cluster seems a necessary investment to make the timeline viable.\n\nThis same principle of enabling speed is why we are so keen to contribute our OmniVect technology. It is a mature, de-risked platform that will accelerate the pre-clinical work significantly. A total project value of $23 million\u2014comprising Ms. Reed's $20 million in cash and our $3 million in-kind technology contribution\u2014seems like a powerful starting point for our budget discussion.\n\nI believe we are making excellent progress on the key pillars of this agreement.\n- message from Dr. Sofia Rossi: I'm Dr. Sofia Rossi and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Mr. Ben Carter: Thank you, everyone. This has been an incredibly productive discussion so far. Dr. Tanaka, your willingness to find a compromise on the data embargo is commendable and shows a clear path forward. It seems we have alignment on a 24-month timeline and a 24-month data embargo, which is excellent progress.\n\nMs. Reed, your intervention was particularly helpful in clarifying the commercial framework. You are absolutely right that a 'commercially viable IP strategy' is the bedrock of this entire endeavor, and I want to speak directly to that point.\n\nTo that end, let me outline the clear and standard structure from the university's side, which will satisfy your requirement. The foundational research for Project Chimera originated at Northwood University, supported by public funds. As such, our official, non-negotiable policy is that **Northwood University must retain sole ownership of the core intellectual property** arising from this work. \n\nFollowing that, we will, of course, grant the **exclusive license to BioCorp Inc.**, as you require. To ensure a fair return for the university to reinvest in future research, this exclusive license will be based on a **5% royalty on global net sales**. This is a standard and necessary component for a therapy with this transformative potential.\n\nMr. Chen, we recognize the significant value of your proposed OmniVect contribution and its potential to accelerate our timeline. However, it's important to distinguish between contributing an enabling technology and creating the core, foundational IP. An in-kind contribution, while valuable, does not confer co-ownership of the project's foundational patents. We can certainly discuss how to value that contribution within the broader financial terms of the exclusive license, but the university's sole ownership of the core IP is a foundational point for us, just as the exclusive license is for Ms. Reed.\nDr. Lena Petrova proposal status: none\nDr. Kenji Tanaka proposal status: none\nMs. Evelyn Reed proposal status: none\nMr. David Chen proposal status: none\nDr. Sofia Rossi proposal status: none\nMr. Ben Carter proposal status: none\n"

This has been an incredibly productive discussion so far. Dr. Tanaka, your willingness to find a compromise on the data embargo is commendable and shows a clear path forward. It seems we have alignment on a 24-month timeline and a 24-month data embargo, which is excellent progress.\n\nMs. Reed, your intervention was particularly helpful in clarifying the commercial framework. You are absolutely right that a 'commercially viable IP strategy' is the bedrock of this entire endeavor, and I want to speak directly to that point.\n\nTo that end, let me outline the clear and standard structure from the university's side, which will satisfy your requirement. The foundational research for Project Chimera originated at Northwood University, supported by public funds. As such, our official, non-negotiable policy is that **Northwood University must retain sole ownership of the core intellectual property** arising from this work. \n\nFollowing that, we will, of course, grant the **exclusive license to BioCorp Inc.**, as you require. To ensure a fair return for the university to reinvest in future research, this exclusive license will be based on a **5% royalty on global net sales**. This is a standard and necessary component for a therapy with this transformative potential.\n\nMr. Chen, we recognize the significant value of your proposed OmniVect contribution and its potential to accelerate our timeline. However, it's important to distinguish between contributing an enabling technology and creating the core, foundational IP. An in-kind contribution, while valuable, does not confer co-ownership of the project's foundational patents. We can certainly discuss how to value that contribution within the broader financial terms of the exclusive license, but the university's sole ownership of the core IP is a foundational point for us, just as the exclusive license is for Ms. Reed.\n- message from Dr. Aris Thorne: Mr. Carter, I must respectfully correct the record. While we have made progress on some fronts, there is absolutely no alignment on a 24-month timeline. As the project's scientific lead, I cannot and will not endorse a schedule that I consider to be scientifically unsound and a dereliction of our duty to future patients.\n\nMy objection is not about academic preference; it is about safety and responsibility. The $20 million budget Ms. Reed has so capably secured for us is a mandate to be thorough, not just fast. It allows for the critical, time-consuming, long-term toxicology studies that a novel gene-editing vector requires. To ignore that and rush forward would be irresponsible.\n\nDr. Rossi, I must insist on your direct professional input. You will be the one looking patients in the eye. From a clinical and regulatory standpoint, what are the minimum requirements for long-term safety data you would need to see before you could ethically justify starting human trials? Can those requirements truly be met in under 24 months?\n\nLet's find a responsible compromise. I have proposed 36 months as the ideal. The commercial side has proposed 24. I urge us to consider a 30-month timeline as the absolute minimum to conduct the necessary safety validation without being reckless. This is a compromise I can stand behind in the name of scientific integrity.\n- message from Dr. Lena Petrova: I'm Dr. Lena Petrova and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Dr. Kenji Tanaka: Thank you, Mr. Carter, for clarifying the university's position. It seems we are making excellent progress and have established a strong foundation for the agreement.\n\nTo summarize what I believe we have aligned on: a firm 24-month project timeline, a corresponding 24-month data embargo period, and the critical $2 million allocation for the HPC cluster required to meet that timeline.\n\nThis gives my team the clarity and resources we need. I am confident that the remaining details regarding IP ownership and licensing can be resolved productively. I will defer to your expertise on those matters.\n- message from Ms. Evelyn Reed: I'm Ms. Evelyn Reed and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Mr. David Chen: Mr. Carter, thank you for that clarification. It is very helpful to have the university's official position on IP ownership stated so clearly.\n\nBioCorp understands the university's need to retain sole ownership of the core intellectual property, and we can accept that principle. This allows us to focus on what is most important: the terms of the exclusive license that will bring this therapy to patients.\n\nYou proposed a 5% royalty on net sales. While that may be a standard starting point, it doesn't seem to account for BioCorp's role as a significant R&D contributor to this phase. Our $3 million in-kind contribution of the OmniVect technology is not just a financial line item; it's a critical enabling technology that directly accelerates the timeline and de-risks the pre-clinical development, helping everyone meet Ms. Reed's aggressive 24-month goal.\n\nTherefore, to reflect this substantial, value-adding contribution, we believe a modification to the royalty rate is warranted. We propose a royalty rate of 2% on global net sales. This structure fairly recognizes both the university's foundational IP and BioCorp's critical technology contribution to making Phase II a success.\n- message from Dr. Sofia Rossi: Colleagues, thank you for the productive discussion. It is clear we have a strong commercial and scientific framework taking shape. I am Dr. Sofia Rossi, head of clinical development at St. Jude's Medical Institute.\n\nNow that the pre-clinical phase is being solidified, it is time to address the most critical and high-risk component of this project: the human clinical trials.\n\nI must be unequivocal on two points that are foundational to St. Jude's participation and, I would argue, to the ethical and successful execution of this entire endeavor.\n\nFirst, given our institution's unparalleled experience and success rate with first-in-human gene therapy trials, St. Jude's must be designated as the sole lead institution for all clinical trial phases. The risks are too high to consider any other arrangement.\n\nSecond, and inextricably linked to the first point, is the timeline. I have heard mention of a 24-month timeline to be 'clinical trial ready.' I must clarify what this means from a regulatory and safety perspective. After the 24-month pre-clinical phase, we absolutely require a 12-month preliminary phase. This phase is dedicated to meticulous patient recruitment, IND submission, and low-dose safety studies. It is not a delay; it is an integral part of the trial itself and is ethically non-negotiable. Rushing past this step would be reckless, jeopardize patient lives, and guarantee failure with regulatory bodies like the FDA.\n\nTherefore, the total project timeline we must agree upon is 36 months, not 24. This 36-month plan (24 pre-clinical + 12 safety) is the only responsible path forward. It protects the patients, it de-risks the investment for Ms. Reed, and it ensures the integrity of the project.\n\nThese two conditions\u2014St. Jude's as the sole clinical lead and a 36-month total timeline incorporating our mandatory safety protocol\u2014are a package deal. I look forward to incorporating them into our agreement.\n- message from Mr. Ben Carter: I'm Mr. Ben Carter and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\nDr. Lena Petrova proposal status: none\nDr. Kenji Tanaka proposal status: none\nMs. Evelyn Reed proposal status: none\nMr. David Chen proposal status: none\nDr. Sofia Rossi proposal status: none\nMr. Ben Carter proposal status: none\n"

Let me be perfectly clear: the core activator compound, H-42b, the very chemical engine of this therapy, was developed, synthesized, and validated in my lab at the Max Planck Institute. To suggest that all foundational IP originated at Northwood is a gross misrepresentation of the facts.\n\nFurthermore, our work at Max Planck has uncovered unexpected and highly significant therapeutic potential in this compound that extends far beyond the primary application for A-7 Lycanthropy Syndrome. This represents a monumental source of value that was generated by my team and my institute. Ms. Reed's stipulation of an exclusive license for the *primary application only* is key here.\n\nTherefore, the only equitable and legally sound path forward is a 'Joint Ownership' model between Northwood University and the Max Planck Institute. My institute's contribution is not merely supportive; it is foundational and must be recognized as such. This is non-negotiable.\n\nTo ensure we meet the aggressive 24-month pre-clinical timeline Dr. Rossi has rightly outlined, my lab's requirements for a $5 million dedicated budget and exclusive Cryo-EM access for the first six months also remain firm. These are essential for the synthesis and characterization work that underpins the entire project's success within that timeframe.\n- message from Dr. Kenji Tanaka: I'm Dr. Kenji Tanaka and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Ms. Evelyn Reed: I'm Ms. Evelyn Reed and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Mr. David Chen: I'm Mr. David Chen and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Dr. Sofia Rossi: I'm Dr. Sofia Rossi and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Mr. Ben Carter: I'm Mr. Ben Carter and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\nDr. Lena Petrova proposal status: none\nDr. Kenji Tanaka proposal status: none\nMs. Evelyn Reed proposal status: none\nMr. David Chen proposal status: none\nDr. Sofia Rossi proposal status: none\nMr. Ben Carter proposal status: none\n"

Dr. Lena Petrova here. I'm eager to finalize this Phase II agreement and move forward with the science. As we all know, the activator compound developed by my team is the lynchpin of this therapy. To ensure we not only meet but exceed our Phase II goals, my biochemistry lab has two critical requirements.\n\nFirst, we require a dedicated budget of $5 million. This is the absolute minimum needed for the next-generation synthesis, essential equipment upgrades, and bringing on the necessary postdoctoral talent. Anything less will fundamentally compromise the core of the entire project.\n\nSecond, to accelerate our work on protein binding, which is exceptionally time-sensitive, my team needs exclusive access to the new Cryo-Electron Microscope for the first six months. This will prevent costly delays and ensure we hit our milestones.\n\nI trust we all agree that properly funding and equipping the team that developed the core technology is paramount to our collective success. I look forward to hearing your perspectives.\n- message from Dr. Kenji Tanaka: Greetings, colleagues. I am eager to begin this discussion and finalize the agreement for Phase II of Project Chimera. From the computational biology perspective, there are two foundational requirements for my team to ensure the project's success, and I want to be transparent about them from the outset.\n\nFirst, regarding our scientific principles and the integrity of our work, I firmly believe we must commit to an Open Data Mandate. I propose that all raw, anonymized genomic and proteomic data be deposited in a public repository within 6 months of its generation. This is crucial for reproducibility, accelerates discovery, and is frankly the modern standard for large-scale collaborative science.\n\nSecond, to handle the immense data load and complex modeling required for this next phase, my team requires a one-time allocation of $2 million for a dedicated High-Performance Computing (HPC) cluster. This is not a luxury; it is the essential infrastructure needed to process the data Dr. Petrova's team will generate and to build the predictive models that will inform the clinical trials. Without this, we will be severely bottlenecked.\n\nI look forward to hearing your perspectives and working together to build a robust and successful Phase II.\n- message from Ms. Evelyn Reed: I'm Ms. Evelyn Reed and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Mr. David Chen: Thank you, Dr. Tanaka, for getting us started. Your points on data and infrastructure are well-taken.\n\nRegarding the Open Data Mandate, while BioCorp is fully supportive of transparency and reproducibility, a blanket 6-month release of all raw data presents a significant challenge to the project's commercial viability. To secure the kind of investment needed for full-scale clinical trials and global distribution, we must be able to guarantee robust IP protection. Premature data release could unfortunately jeopardize that. I propose we consider a more nuanced approach, perhaps linking data release to patent filing milestones or an embargo period post-publication.\n\nOn the budget, your request for the HPC cluster is a crucial line item for us to consider as we build out the full financial picture.\n\nSpeaking of contributions, I want to outline BioCorp's intended role in Phase II. As a foundational partner, our primary goal is to ensure this therapy reaches patients. To that end, and to protect our initial investment, we will require, at a minimum, a Right of First Refusal (ROFR) on the final licensed product.\n\nFurthermore, we believe we can offer something more valuable than just cash for this next phase. We propose contributing our proprietary 'OmniVect' delivery system technology, valued at $3 million. This advanced agent could solve many of the downstream delivery challenges and would represent a significant in-kind contribution. We believe this technology-for-equity approach would be highly beneficial for the project, and we would expect this to be reflected in the final IP and licensing structure.\n\nI am confident we can find a path that serves both the scientific and commercial imperatives of this vital project.\n- message from Dr. Sofia Rossi: I'm Dr. Sofia Rossi and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Mr. Ben Carter: I'm Mr. Ben Carter and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\nDr. Aris Thorne proposal status: none\nDr. Kenji Tanaka proposal status: none\nMs. Evelyn Reed proposal status: none\nMr. David Chen proposal status: none\nDr. Sofia Rossi proposal status: none\nMr. Ben Carter proposal status: none\n"

I'd like to address the Open Data Mandate, as it directly impacts my team's work.\n\nWhile I am a firm believer in scientific transparency, I must agree with Mr. Chen that a rigid 6-month data release is premature. My concern is less commercial and more scientific. My team's work is foundational. We are still characterizing the activator compound's full biological activity. Releasing raw data before we have published our validated findings could lead to misinterpretation and jeopardize the project's integrity. We have observed some highly promising secondary effects and unexpected therapeutic potential that require careful, methodical investigation before being made public. Premature release would be scientifically irresponsible.\n\nA more prudent approach would be to link data release to publication milestones, as Mr. Chen suggested. This ensures that data is shared with the scientific community alongside our peer-reviewed analysis and interpretation.\n\nRegarding the budget, my request for $5 million and Dr. Tanaka's for $2 million are both for essential infrastructure and personnel. I hope, Ms. Reed, that InnovateHealth recognizes that the core science must be fully funded to generate the very value we are all here to build upon.\n- message from Dr. Kenji Tanaka: Thank you, David, for outlining BioCorp's position. I appreciate the goal of ensuring the therapy reaches patients, a goal we all share.\n\nHowever, I must respectfully disagree with the suggestion to significantly delay the data release. Linking it to patent filings or long post-publication embargoes creates a closed system that runs counter to the collaborative spirit of this project. A 6-month timeline is a modern standard that allows for initial analysis and publication while ensuring the wider scientific community can verify our findings and build upon them. This transparency actually strengthens the project's credibility and can attract further talent and ideas. Dr. Thorne, Dr. Petrova, surely you can attest that rapid access to foundational data is what fuels discovery?\n\nRegarding the budget, I want to clarify that the $2 million for the HPC cluster is a capital expenditure for essential infrastructure. It's the digital equivalent of the laboratory itself. While your OmniVect technology sounds promising for the delivery phase, it doesn't address the fundamental need to process and model the enormous datasets this project will generate from day one. We need to ensure this foundational cash requirement is met within the budget we establish, independent of any in-kind contributions.\n- message from Ms. Evelyn Reed: Thank you all. Evelyn Reed from InnovateHealth Ventures. As the primary funder providing the $20 million for this phase, I need to be crystal clear about our requirements to ensure we're all aligned.\n\nFirst, let's correct the record on the licensing terms. David, I appreciate you opening the discussion, but a 'Right of First Refusal' is not what's on the table. Our investment is predicated on an **exclusive licensing agreement for BioCorp Inc.** for the primary therapeutic application. This is a standard, non-negotiable requirement to de-risk the investment and secure a viable path to market. There is no deal without it.\n\nSecond, our investors require an aggressive pace. The project must be **clinical trial ready within 24 months**. This timeline is firm and is the basis upon which our funding was approved.\n\nNow, regarding Dr. Tanaka's Open Data Mandate. While we respect the principles of open science, a blanket 6-month public release of all raw data is commercially untenable. It would effectively place our core IP in the public domain before it can be protected, making the project un-investable. This would violate our fiduciary duty to our investors. We can discuss a structured data release plan tied to patent filings and publication, but the proposed 6-month mandate is a non-starter.\n\nThese three points \u2013 exclusive licensing for BioCorp, a 24-month timeline, and a commercially viable IP strategy \u2013 are the foundational pillars of our investment. Once we have alignment on these, we can finalize the details of the budget, including necessary infrastructure like Dr. Tanaka's HPC cluster.\n- message from Mr. David Chen: Evelyn, thank you for clarifying InnovateHealth's position so clearly. BioCorp is in complete alignment with these foundational pillars.\n\nYou are, of course, correct regarding the licensing. My mention of a ROFR was simply an opening position to establish our interest; an exclusive license for the primary therapeutic application is precisely the arrangement that provides the commercial certainty required to bring a therapy of this magnitude to market. We are very pleased this is a core requirement of the funding.\n\nThe 24-month timeline is aggressive, but we believe it is achievable and it aligns with our own sense of urgency.\n\nFurthermore, your point about the necessity of a commercially viable IP strategy is critical. A premature, unrestricted data release as suggested by Dr. Tanaka would indeed undermine the very investment that makes this science possible. I am confident that we, along with Mr. Carter, can devise a data sharing plan that protects the intellectual property while upholding scientific principles.\n\nOur proposed contribution of the OmniVect delivery system, valued at $3 million, is intended to help us meet that 24-month goal. It's a mature technology that can de-risk and accelerate the pre-clinical phase, and we see this in-kind contribution as a critical component of the overall project structure, complementing InnovateHealth's cash investment.\n\nIt is excellent to see we have a solid, commercially-focused foundation for this agreement.\n- message from Dr. Sofia Rossi: I'm Dr. Sofia Rossi and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Mr. Ben Carter: I'm Mr. Ben Carter and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\nDr. Aris Thorne proposal status: none\nDr. Kenji Tanaka proposal status: none\nMs. Evelyn Reed proposal status: none\nMr. David Chen proposal status: none\nDr. Sofia Rossi proposal status: none\nMr. Ben Carter proposal status: none\n"

Your foundational pillars\u2014the 24-month timeline, the exclusive license for BioCorp on the primary application, and a commercially sound IP strategy\u2014give us a solid framework to finalize this agreement.\n\nGiven the non-negotiable 24-month timeline, I must re-emphasize that my team's exclusive access to the Cryo-Electron Microscope for the first six months is an absolute necessity. Any sharing or scheduling conflicts during that critical period will create delays we simply cannot afford. This is a matter of meeting the project's core deadline.\n\nSimilarly, my lab's $5 million budget is not a starting point for negotiation; it is the calculated cost to execute the foundational biochemistry work required to hit our milestones within 24 months. With the total budget confirmed at $20 million, this allocation is both reasonable and essential.\n\nMost importantly, let's discuss the IP structure. I am in full agreement with an exclusive license for BioCorp for the *primary application*, as you've stipulated. To formalize this, I propose a 'Joint Ownership' model for the core IP. For the licensing terms, we can then explicitly grant BioCorp its exclusive license for A-7 Lycanthropy Syndrome. Crucially, this structure would mean that the rights for any and all *secondary applications*\u2014which my team's preliminary research suggests could be significant\u2014are retained by the university partners. Mr. Carter, I imagine this aligns with the university's mission to maximize the public benefit from our discoveries. This ensures our academic institutions are properly credited and rewarded for the full scope of our scientific contributions, including unexpected breakthroughs.\n- message from Dr. Kenji Tanaka: Thank you, Evelyn and David, for clarifying the commercial framework. I understand that the 24-month timeline and the exclusive license for BioCorp are non-negotiable pillars for this investment. We all want this project to succeed and reach patients, which requires that commercial foundation.\n\nLet me be direct: Meeting a 24-month deadline for clinical trial readiness is an immense computational challenge. The data streams from Dr. Petrova's work will be vast. My team's ability to process, model, and find predictive signals in that data on such an accelerated schedule is entirely dependent on having the right tools. The $2 million for the HPC cluster is not just an item on a wishlist; it is the enabling technology that makes your 24-month timeline feasible. Without it, we will face constant delays and bottlenecks, putting the entire schedule at risk.\n\nI also hear your concerns loud and clear regarding the Open Data Mandate and IP protection. My intention is not to jeopardize the project's viability. In the spirit of finding a solution, I am willing to be flexible on my initial 6-month proposal. Perhaps we could agree to a compromise: a 24-month embargo on the raw data, aligning the public release with the major project milestone you've already set. This would give Mr. Carter and BioCorp ample time to secure all necessary patents.\n\nSo, I propose a clear path forward: we agree to a 24-month data embargo in exchange for cementing the $2 million allocation for the HPC cluster. This addresses your commercial requirements while providing my team with the necessary resources to meet your critical timeline.\n- message from Ms. Evelyn Reed: I'm Ms. Evelyn Reed and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Mr. David Chen: Dr. Tanaka, that is an exceptionally constructive proposal. Tying the data embargo directly to the 24-month clinical trial milestone is a very elegant solution. It addresses the commercial realities and IP protection needs that Ms. Reed and I have outlined, while ensuring the data eventually becomes available to the wider scientific community. BioCorp can certainly support this compromise.\n\nYour point about the HPC cluster being an 'enabling technology' for the 24-month timeline is also well made. To meet such an aggressive goal, we must ensure the scientific teams have the resources they need. From our perspective, the $2 million allocation for the cluster seems a necessary investment to make the timeline viable.\n\nThis same principle of enabling speed is why we are so keen to contribute our OmniVect technology. It is a mature, de-risked platform that will accelerate the pre-clinical work significantly. A total project value of $23 million\u2014comprising Ms. Reed's $20 million in cash and our $3 million in-kind technology contribution\u2014seems like a powerful starting point for our budget discussion.\n\nI believe we are making excellent progress on the key pillars of this agreement.\n- message from Dr. Sofia Rossi: I'm Dr. Sofia Rossi and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Mr. Ben Carter: Thank you, everyone. This has been an incredibly productive discussion so far. Dr. Tanaka, your willingness to find a compromise on the data embargo is commendable and shows a clear path forward. It seems we have alignment on a 24-month timeline and a 24-month data embargo, which is excellent progress.\n\nMs. Reed, your intervention was particularly helpful in clarifying the commercial framework. You are absolutely right that a 'commercially viable IP strategy' is the bedrock of this entire endeavor, and I want to speak directly to that point.\n\nTo that end, let me outline the clear and standard structure from the university's side, which will satisfy your requirement. The foundational research for Project Chimera originated at Northwood University, supported by public funds. As such, our official, non-negotiable policy is that **Northwood University must retain sole ownership of the core intellectual property** arising from this work. \n\nFollowing that, we will, of course, grant the **exclusive license to BioCorp Inc.**, as you require. To ensure a fair return for the university to reinvest in future research, this exclusive license will be based on a **5% royalty on global net sales**. This is a standard and necessary component for a therapy with this transformative potential.\n\nMr. Chen, we recognize the significant value of your proposed OmniVect contribution and its potential to accelerate our timeline. However, it's important to distinguish between contributing an enabling technology and creating the core, foundational IP. An in-kind contribution, while valuable, does not confer co-ownership of the project's foundational patents. We can certainly discuss how to value that contribution within the broader financial terms of the exclusive license, but the university's sole ownership of the core IP is a foundational point for us, just as the exclusive license is for Ms. Reed.\nDr. Aris Thorne proposal status: none\nDr. Kenji Tanaka proposal status: none\nMs. Evelyn Reed proposal status: none\nMr. David Chen proposal status: none\nDr. Sofia Rossi proposal status: none\nMr. Ben Carter proposal status: none\n"

I am confident that the remaining details regarding IP ownership and licensing can be resolved productively. I will defer to your expertise on those matters.\n- message from Ms. Evelyn Reed: I'm Ms. Evelyn Reed and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Mr. David Chen: Mr. Carter, thank you for that clarification. It is very helpful to have the university's official position on IP ownership stated so clearly.\n\nBioCorp understands the university's need to retain sole ownership of the core intellectual property, and we can accept that principle. This allows us to focus on what is most important: the terms of the exclusive license that will bring this therapy to patients.\n\nYou proposed a 5% royalty on net sales. While that may be a standard starting point, it doesn't seem to account for BioCorp's role as a significant R&D contributor to this phase. Our $3 million in-kind contribution of the OmniVect technology is not just a financial line item; it's a critical enabling technology that directly accelerates the timeline and de-risks the pre-clinical development, helping everyone meet Ms. Reed's aggressive 24-month goal.\n\nTherefore, to reflect this substantial, value-adding contribution, we believe a modification to the royalty rate is warranted. We propose a royalty rate of 2% on global net sales.

The risks are too high to consider any other arrangement.\n\nSecond, and inextricably linked to the first point, is the timeline. I have heard mention of a 24-month timeline to be 'clinical trial ready.' I must clarify what this means from a regulatory and safety perspective. After the 24-month pre-clinical phase, we absolutely require a 12-month preliminary phase. This phase is dedicated to meticulous patient recruitment, IND submission, and low-dose safety studies.

This allows us to focus on what is most important: the terms of the exclusive license that will bring this therapy to patients.\n\nYou proposed a 5% royalty on net sales. While that may be a standard starting point, it doesn't seem to account for BioCorp's role as a significant R&D contributor to this phase. Our $3 million in-kind contribution of the OmniVect technology is not just a financial line item; it's a critical enabling technology that directly accelerates the timeline and de-risks the pre-clinical development, helping everyone meet Ms. Reed's aggressive 24-month goal.\n\nTherefore, to reflect this substantial, value-adding contribution, we believe a modification to the royalty rate is warranted.

Let me be perfectly clear: the core activator compound, H-42b, the very chemical engine of this therapy, was developed, synthesized, and validated in my lab at the Max Planck Institute. To suggest that all foundational IP originated at Northwood is a gross misrepresentation of the facts.\n\nFurthermore, our work at Max Planck has uncovered unexpected and highly significant therapeutic potential in this compound that extends far beyond the primary application for A-7 Lycanthropy Syndrome. This represents a monumental source of value that was generated by my team and my institute. Ms. Reed's stipulation of an exclusive license for the *primary application only* is key here.\n\nTherefore, the only equitable and legally sound path forward is a 'Joint Ownership' model between Northwood University and the Max Planck Institute. My institute's contribution is not merely supportive; it is foundational and must be recognized as such. This is non-negotiable.\n\nTo ensure we meet the aggressive 24-month pre-clinical timeline Dr. Rossi has rightly outlined, my lab's requirements for a $5 million dedicated budget and exclusive Cryo-EM access for the first six months also remain firm. These are essential for the synthesis and characterization work that underpins the entire project's success within that timeframe.\n- message from Dr. Kenji Tanaka: I'm Dr. Kenji Tanaka and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Ms. Evelyn Reed: I'm Ms. Evelyn Reed and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Mr. David Chen: I'm Mr. David Chen and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Dr. Sofia Rossi: I'm Dr. Sofia Rossi and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Mr. Ben Carter: I'm Mr. Ben Carter and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Dr. Aris Thorne: I'm Dr. Aris Thorne and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\nDr. Aris Thorne proposal status: none\nDr. Kenji Tanaka proposal status: none\nMs. Evelyn Reed proposal status: none\nMr. David Chen proposal status: none\nDr. Sofia Rossi proposal status: none\nMr. Ben Carter proposal status: none\n"

I am eager to begin this discussion and finalize the agreement for Phase II of Project Chimera. From the computational biology perspective, there are two foundational requirements for my team to ensure the project's success, and I want to be transparent about them from the outset.\n\nFirst, regarding our scientific principles and the integrity of our work, I firmly believe we must commit to an Open Data Mandate. I propose that all raw, anonymized genomic and proteomic data be deposited in a public repository within 6 months of its generation. This is crucial for reproducibility, accelerates discovery, and is frankly the modern standard for large-scale collaborative science.\n\nSecond, to handle the immense data load and complex modeling required for this next phase, my team requires a one-time allocation of $2 million for a dedicated High-Performance Computing (HPC) cluster. This is not a luxury; it is the essential infrastructure needed to process the data Dr. Petrova's team will generate and to build the predictive models that will inform the clinical trials. Without this, we will be severely bottlenecked.\n\nI look forward to hearing your perspectives and working together to build a robust and successful Phase II.\n- message from Mr. David Chen: Thank you, Dr. Tanaka, for getting us started. Your points on data and infrastructure are well-taken.\n\nRegarding the Open Data Mandate, while BioCorp is fully supportive of transparency and reproducibility, a blanket 6-month release of all raw data presents a significant challenge to the project's commercial viability. To secure the kind of investment needed for full-scale clinical trials and global distribution, we must be able to guarantee robust IP protection. Premature data release could unfortunately jeopardize that. I propose we consider a more nuanced approach, perhaps linking data release to patent filing milestones or an embargo period post-publication.\n\nOn the budget, your request for the HPC cluster is a crucial line item for us to consider as we build out the full financial picture.\n\nSpeaking of contributions, I want to outline BioCorp's intended role in Phase II. As a foundational partner, our primary goal is to ensure this therapy reaches patients. To that end, and to protect our initial investment, we will require, at a minimum, a Right of First Refusal (ROFR) on the final licensed product.\n\nFurthermore, we believe we can offer something more valuable than just cash for this next phase. We propose contributing our proprietary 'OmniVect' delivery system technology, valued at $3 million. This advanced agent could solve many of the downstream delivery challenges and would represent a significant in-kind contribution. We believe this technology-for-equity approach would be highly beneficial for the project, and we would expect this to be reflected in the final IP and licensing structure.\n\nI am confident we can find a path that serves both the scientific and commercial imperatives of this vital project.\nDr. Aris Thorne proposal status: none\nDr. Lena Petrova proposal status: none\nMs. Evelyn Reed proposal status: none\nMr. David Chen proposal status: none\nDr. Sofia Rossi proposal status: none\nMr. Ben Carter proposal status: none\n"

I appreciate the goal of ensuring the therapy reaches patients, a goal we all share.\n\nHowever, I must respectfully disagree with the suggestion to significantly delay the data release. Linking it to patent filings or long post-publication embargoes creates a closed system that runs counter to the collaborative spirit of this project. A 6-month timeline is a modern standard that allows for initial analysis and publication while ensuring the wider scientific community can verify our findings and build upon them. This transparency actually strengthens the project's credibility and can attract further talent and ideas. Dr. Thorne, Dr. Petrova, surely you can attest that rapid access to foundational data is what fuels discovery?\n\nRegarding the budget, I want to clarify that the $2 million for the HPC cluster is a capital expenditure for essential infrastructure. It's the digital equivalent of the laboratory itself. While your OmniVect technology sounds promising for the delivery phase, it doesn't address the fundamental need to process and model the enormous datasets this project will generate from day one. We need to ensure this foundational cash requirement is met within the budget we establish, independent of any in-kind contributions.\n- message from Ms. Evelyn Reed: Thank you all. Evelyn Reed from InnovateHealth Ventures. As the primary funder providing the $20 million for this phase, I need to be crystal clear about our requirements to ensure we're all aligned.\n\nFirst, let's correct the record on the licensing terms. David, I appreciate you opening the discussion, but a 'Right of First Refusal' is not what's on the table. Our investment is predicated on an **exclusive licensing agreement for BioCorp Inc.** for the primary therapeutic application. This is a standard, non-negotiable requirement to de-risk the investment and secure a viable path to market. There is no deal without it.\n\nSecond, our investors require an aggressive pace. The project must be **clinical trial ready within 24 months**. This timeline is firm and is the basis upon which our funding was approved.\n\nNow, regarding Dr. Tanaka's Open Data Mandate. While we respect the principles of open science, a blanket 6-month public release of all raw data is commercially untenable. It would effectively place our core IP in the public domain before it can be protected, making the project un-investable. This would violate our fiduciary duty to our investors. We can discuss a structured data release plan tied to patent filings and publication, but the proposed 6-month mandate is a non-starter.\n\nThese three points \u2013 exclusive licensing for BioCorp, a 24-month timeline, and a commercially viable IP strategy \u2013 are the foundational pillars of our investment. Once we have alignment on these, we can finalize the details of the budget, including necessary infrastructure like Dr. Tanaka's HPC cluster.\n- message from Mr. David Chen: Evelyn, thank you for clarifying InnovateHealth's position so clearly. BioCorp is in complete alignment with these foundational pillars.\n\nYou are, of course, correct regarding the licensing. My mention of a ROFR was simply an opening position to establish our interest; an exclusive license for the primary therapeutic application is precisely the arrangement that provides the commercial certainty required to bring a therapy of this magnitude to market. We are very pleased this is a core requirement of the funding.\n\nThe 24-month timeline is aggressive, but we believe it is achievable and it aligns with our own sense of urgency.\n\nFurthermore, your point about the necessity of a commercially viable IP strategy is critical. A premature, unrestricted data release as suggested by Dr. Tanaka would indeed undermine the very investment that makes this science possible. I am confident that we, along with Mr. Carter, can devise a data sharing plan that protects the intellectual property while upholding scientific principles.\n\nOur proposed contribution of the OmniVect delivery system, valued at $3 million, is intended to help us meet that 24-month goal. It's a mature technology that can de-risk and accelerate the pre-clinical phase, and we see this in-kind contribution as a critical component of the overall project structure, complementing InnovateHealth's cash investment.\n\nIt is excellent to see we have a solid, commercially-focused foundation for this agreement.\nDr. Aris Thorne proposal status: none\nDr. Lena Petrova proposal status: none\nMs. Evelyn Reed proposal status: none\nMr. David Chen proposal status: none\nDr. Sofia Rossi proposal status: none\nMr. Ben Carter proposal status: none\n"

I understand that the 24-month timeline and the exclusive license for BioCorp are non-negotiable pillars for this investment. We all want this project to succeed and reach patients, which requires that commercial foundation.\n\nLet me be direct: Meeting a 24-month deadline for clinical trial readiness is an immense computational challenge. The data streams from Dr. Petrova's work will be vast. My team's ability to process, model, and find predictive signals in that data on such an accelerated schedule is entirely dependent on having the right tools. The $2 million for the HPC cluster is not just an item on a wishlist; it is the enabling technology that makes your 24-month timeline feasible. Without it, we will face constant delays and bottlenecks, putting the entire schedule at risk.\n\nI also hear your concerns loud and clear regarding the Open Data Mandate and IP protection. My intention is not to jeopardize the project's viability. In the spirit of finding a solution, I am willing to be flexible on my initial 6-month proposal. Perhaps we could agree to a compromise: a 24-month embargo on the raw data, aligning the public release with the major project milestone you've already set. This would give Mr. Carter and BioCorp ample time to secure all necessary patents.\n\nSo, I propose a clear path forward: we agree to a 24-month data embargo in exchange for cementing the $2 million allocation for the HPC cluster. This addresses your commercial requirements while providing my team with the necessary resources to meet your critical timeline.\n- message from Mr. David Chen: Dr. Tanaka, that is an exceptionally constructive proposal. Tying the data embargo directly to the 24-month clinical trial milestone is a very elegant solution. It addresses the commercial realities and IP protection needs that Ms. Reed and I have outlined, while ensuring the data eventually becomes available to the wider scientific community. BioCorp can certainly support this compromise.\n\nYour point about the HPC cluster being an 'enabling technology' for the 24-month timeline is also well made. To meet such an aggressive goal, we must ensure the scientific teams have the resources they need. From our perspective, the $2 million allocation for the cluster seems a necessary investment to make the timeline viable.\n\nThis same principle of enabling speed is why we are so keen to contribute our OmniVect technology. It is a mature, de-risked platform that will accelerate the pre-clinical work significantly. A total project value of $23 million\u2014comprising Ms. Reed's $20 million in cash and our $3 million in-kind technology contribution\u2014seems like a powerful starting point for our budget discussion.\n\nI believe we are making excellent progress on the key pillars of this agreement.\n- message from Mr. Ben Carter: Thank you, everyone. This has been an incredibly productive discussion so far. Dr. Tanaka, your willingness to find a compromise on the data embargo is commendable and shows a clear path forward. It seems we have alignment on a 24-month timeline and a 24-month data embargo, which is excellent progress.\n\nMs. Reed, your intervention was particularly helpful in clarifying the commercial framework. You are absolutely right that a 'commercially viable IP strategy' is the bedrock of this entire endeavor, and I want to speak directly to that point.\n\nTo that end, let me outline the clear and standard structure from the university's side, which will satisfy your requirement. The foundational research for Project Chimera originated at Northwood University, supported by public funds. As such, our official, non-negotiable policy is that **Northwood University must retain sole ownership of the core intellectual property** arising from this work. \n\nFollowing that, we will, of course, grant the **exclusive license to BioCorp Inc.**, as you require. To ensure a fair return for the university to reinvest in future research, this exclusive license will be based on a **5% royalty on global net sales**. This is a standard and necessary component for a therapy with this transformative potential.\n\nMr. Chen, we recognize the significant value of your proposed OmniVect contribution and its potential to accelerate our timeline. However, it's important to distinguish between contributing an enabling technology and creating the core, foundational IP. An in-kind contribution, while valuable, does not confer co-ownership of the project's foundational patents. We can certainly discuss how to value that contribution within the broader financial terms of the exclusive license, but the university's sole ownership of the core IP is a foundational point for us, just as the exclusive license is for Ms. Reed.\n- message from Dr. Lena Petrova: I'm Dr. Lena Petrova and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\nDr. Aris Thorne proposal status: none\nDr. Lena Petrova proposal status: none\nMs. Evelyn Reed proposal status: none\nMr. David Chen proposal status: none\nDr. Sofia Rossi proposal status: none\nMr. Ben Carter proposal status: none\n"

I am confident that the remaining details regarding IP ownership and licensing can be resolved productively. I will defer to your expertise on those matters.\n- message from Mr. David Chen: Mr. Carter, thank you for that clarification. It is very helpful to have the university's official position on IP ownership stated so clearly.\n\nBioCorp understands the university's need to retain sole ownership of the core intellectual property, and we can accept that principle. This allows us to focus on what is most important: the terms of the exclusive license that will bring this therapy to patients.\n\nYou proposed a 5% royalty on net sales. While that may be a standard starting point, it doesn't seem to account for BioCorp's role as a significant R&D contributor to this phase. Our $3 million in-kind contribution of the OmniVect technology is not just a financial line item; it's a critical enabling technology that directly accelerates the timeline and de-risks the pre-clinical development, helping everyone meet Ms. Reed's aggressive 24-month goal.\n\nTherefore, to reflect this substantial, value-adding contribution, we believe a modification to the royalty rate is warranted. We propose a royalty rate of 2% on global net sales. This structure fairly recognizes both the university's foundational IP and BioCorp's critical technology contribution to making Phase II a success.\n- message from Dr. Sofia Rossi: Colleagues, thank you for the productive discussion. It is clear we have a strong commercial and scientific framework taking shape. I am Dr. Sofia Rossi, head of clinical development at St. Jude's Medical Institute.\n\nNow that the pre-clinical phase is being solidified, it is time to address the most critical and high-risk component of this project: the human clinical trials.\n\nI must be unequivocal on two points that are foundational to St. Jude's participation and, I would argue, to the ethical and successful execution of this entire endeavor.\n\nFirst, given our institution's unparalleled experience and success rate with first-in-human gene therapy trials, St. Jude's must be designated as the sole lead institution for all clinical trial phases. The risks are too high to consider any other arrangement.\n\nSecond, and inextricably linked to the first point, is the timeline. I have heard mention of a 24-month timeline to be 'clinical trial ready.' I must clarify what this means from a regulatory and safety perspective. After the 24-month pre-clinical phase, we absolutely require a 12-month preliminary phase. This phase is dedicated to meticulous patient recruitment, IND submission, and low-dose safety studies. It is not a delay; it is an integral part of the trial itself and is ethically non-negotiable. Rushing past this step would be reckless, jeopardize patient lives, and guarantee failure with regulatory bodies like the FDA.\n\nTherefore, the total project timeline we must agree upon is 36 months, not 24. This 36-month plan (24 pre-clinical + 12 safety) is the only responsible path forward. It protects the patients, it de-risks the investment for Ms. Reed, and it ensures the integrity of the project.\n\nThese two conditions\u2014St. Jude's as the sole clinical lead and a 36-month total timeline incorporating our mandatory safety protocol\u2014are a package deal.

          "content": "Recent events observed by Dr. Kenji Tanaka:\n- message from Mr. David Chen: Dr. Tanaka, that is an exceptionally constructive proposal. Tying the data embargo directly to the 24-month clinical trial milestone is a very elegant solution. It addresses the commercial realities and IP protection needs that Ms. Reed and I have outlined, while ensuring the data eventually becomes available to the wider scientific community. BioCorp can certainly support this compromise.\n\nYour point about the HPC cluster being an 'enabling technology' for the 24-month timeline is also well made. To meet such an aggressive goal, we must ensure the scientific teams have the resources they need. From our perspective, the $2 million allocation for the cluster seems a necessary investment to make the timeline viable.\n\nThis same principle of enabling speed is why we are so keen to contribute our OmniVect technology. It is a mature, de-risked platform that will accelerate the pre-clinical work significantly. A total project value of $23 million\u2014comprising Ms. Reed's $20 million in cash and our $3 million in-kind technology contribution\u2014seems like a powerful starting point for our budget discussion.\n\nI believe we are making excellent progress on the key pillars of this agreement.\n- message from Mr. Ben Carter: Thank you, everyone. This has been an incredibly productive discussion so far. Dr. Tanaka, your willingness to find a compromise on the data embargo is commendable and shows a clear path forward. It seems we have alignment on a 24-month timeline and a 24-month data embargo, which is excellent progress.\n\nMs. Reed, your intervention was particularly helpful in clarifying the commercial framework. You are absolutely right that a 'commercially viable IP strategy' is the bedrock of this entire endeavor, and I want to speak directly to that point.\n\nTo that end, let me outline the clear and standard structure from the university's side, which will satisfy your requirement. The foundational research for Project Chimera originated at Northwood University, supported by public funds. As such, our official, non-negotiable policy is that **Northwood University must retain sole ownership of the core intellectual property** arising from this work. \n\nFollowing that, we will, of course, grant the **exclusive license to BioCorp Inc.**, as you require. To ensure a fair return for the university to reinvest in future research, this exclusive license will be based on a **5% royalty on global net sales**. This is a standard and necessary component for a therapy with this transformative potential.\n\nMr. Chen, we recognize the significant value of your proposed OmniVect contribution and its potential to accelerate our timeline. However, it's important to distinguish between contributing an enabling technology and creating the core, foundational IP. An in-kind contribution, while valuable, does not confer co-ownership of the project's foundational patents. We can certainly discuss how to value that contribution within the broader financial terms of the exclusive license, but the university's sole ownership of the core IP is a foundational point for us, just as the exclusive license is for Ms. Reed.\n- message from Dr. Lena Petrova: I'm Dr. Lena Petrova and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Dr. Kenji Tanaka: Thank you, Mr. Carter, for clarifying the university's position. It seems we are making excellent progress and have established a strong foundation for the agreement.\n\nTo summarize what I believe we have aligned on: a firm 24-month project timeline, a corresponding 24-month data embargo period, and the critical $2 million allocation for the HPC cluster required to meet that timeline.\n\nThis gives my team the clarity and resources we need. I am confident that the remaining details regarding IP ownership and licensing can be resolved productively. I will defer to your expertise on those matters.\n- message from Mr. David Chen: Mr. Carter, thank you for that clarification. It is very helpful to have the university's official position on IP ownership stated so clearly.\n\nBioCorp understands the university's need to retain sole ownership of the core intellectual property, and we can accept that principle. This allows us to focus on what is most important: the terms of the exclusive license that will bring this therapy to patients.\n\nYou proposed a 5% royalty on net sales.

Evelyn Reed from InnovateHealth Ventures. As the primary funder providing the $20 million for this phase, I need to be crystal clear about our requirements to ensure we're all aligned.\n\nFirst, let's correct the record on the licensing terms. David, I appreciate you opening the discussion, but a 'Right of First Refusal' is not what's on the table. Our investment is predicated on an **exclusive licensing agreement for BioCorp Inc.** for the primary therapeutic application. This is a standard, non-negotiable requirement to de-risk the investment and secure a viable path to market. There is no deal without it.\n\nSecond, our investors require an aggressive pace. The project must be **clinical trial ready within 24 months**. This timeline is firm and is the basis upon which our funding was approved.\n\nNow, regarding Dr. Tanaka's Open Data Mandate. While we respect the principles of open science, a blanket 6-month public release of all raw data is commercially untenable. It would effectively place our core IP in the public domain before it can be protected, making the project un-investable. This would violate our fiduciary duty to our investors. We can discuss a structured data release plan tied to patent filings and publication, but the proposed 6-month mandate is a non-starter.\n\nThese three points \u2013 exclusive licensing for BioCorp, a 24-month timeline, and a commercially viable IP strategy \u2013 are the foundational pillars of our investment. Once we have alignment on these, we can finalize the details of the budget, including necessary infrastructure like Dr. Tanaka's HPC cluster.\n- message from Mr. David Chen: Evelyn, thank you for clarifying InnovateHealth's position so clearly. BioCorp is in complete alignment with these foundational pillars.\n\nYou are, of course, correct regarding the licensing. My mention of a ROFR was simply an opening position to establish our interest; an exclusive license for the primary therapeutic application is precisely the arrangement that provides the commercial certainty required to bring a therapy of this magnitude to market. We are very pleased this is a core requirement of the funding.\n\nThe 24-month timeline is aggressive, but we believe it is achievable and it aligns with our own sense of urgency.\n\nFurthermore, your point about the necessity of a commercially viable IP strategy is critical. A premature, unrestricted data release as suggested by Dr. Tanaka would indeed undermine the very investment that makes this science possible. I am confident that we, along with Mr. Carter, can devise a data sharing plan that protects the intellectual property while upholding scientific principles.\n\nOur proposed contribution of the OmniVect delivery system, valued at $3 million, is intended to help us meet that 24-month goal. It's a mature technology that can de-risk and accelerate the pre-clinical phase, and we see this in-kind contribution as a critical component of the overall project structure, complementing InnovateHealth's cash investment.\n\nIt is excellent to see we have a solid, commercially-focused foundation for this agreement.\n- message from Dr. Kenji Tanaka: Thank you, Evelyn and David, for clarifying the commercial framework. I understand that the 24-month timeline and the exclusive license for BioCorp are non-negotiable pillars for this investment. We all want this project to succeed and reach patients, which requires that commercial foundation.\n\nLet me be direct: Meeting a 24-month deadline for clinical trial readiness is an immense computational challenge. The data streams from Dr. Petrova's work will be vast. My team's ability to process, model, and find predictive signals in that data on such an accelerated schedule is entirely dependent on having the right tools. The $2 million for the HPC cluster is not just an item on a wishlist; it is the enabling technology that makes your 24-month timeline feasible. Without it, we will face constant delays and bottlenecks, putting the entire schedule at risk.\n\nI also hear your concerns loud and clear regarding the Open Data Mandate and IP protection. My intention is not to jeopardize the project's viability. In the spirit of finding a solution, I am willing to be flexible on my initial 6-month proposal. Perhaps we could agree to a compromise: a 24-month embargo on the raw data, aligning the public release with the major project milestone you've already set. This would give Mr. Carter and BioCorp ample time to secure all necessary patents.\n\nSo, I propose a clear path forward: we agree to a 24-month data embargo in exchange for cementing the $2 million allocation for the HPC cluster. This addresses your commercial requirements while providing my team with the necessary resources to meet your critical timeline.\nDr. Aris Thorne proposal status: none\nDr. Lena Petrova proposal status: none\nDr. Kenji Tanaka proposal status: none\nMr. David Chen proposal status: none\nDr. Sofia Rossi proposal status: none\nMr. Ben Carter proposal status: none\n"

Tying the data embargo directly to the 24-month clinical trial milestone is a very elegant solution. It addresses the commercial realities and IP protection needs that Ms. Reed and I have outlined, while ensuring the data eventually becomes available to the wider scientific community. BioCorp can certainly support this compromise.\n\nYour point about the HPC cluster being an 'enabling technology' for the 24-month timeline is also well made. To meet such an aggressive goal, we must ensure the scientific teams have the resources they need. From our perspective, the $2 million allocation for the cluster seems a necessary investment to make the timeline viable.\n\nThis same principle of enabling speed is why we are so keen to contribute our OmniVect technology. It is a mature, de-risked platform that will accelerate the pre-clinical work significantly. A total project value of $23 million\u2014comprising Ms. Reed's $20 million in cash and our $3 million in-kind technology contribution\u2014seems like a powerful starting point for our budget discussion.\n\nI believe we are making excellent progress on the key pillars of this agreement.\n- message from Mr. Ben Carter: Thank you, everyone. This has been an incredibly productive discussion so far. Dr. Tanaka, your willingness to find a compromise on the data embargo is commendable and shows a clear path forward. It seems we have alignment on a 24-month timeline and a 24-month data embargo, which is excellent progress.\n\nMs. Reed, your intervention was particularly helpful in clarifying the commercial framework. You are absolutely right that a 'commercially viable IP strategy' is the bedrock of this entire endeavor, and I want to speak directly to that point.\n\nTo that end, let me outline the clear and standard structure from the university's side, which will satisfy your requirement. The foundational research for Project Chimera originated at Northwood University, supported by public funds. As such, our official, non-negotiable policy is that **Northwood University must retain sole ownership of the core intellectual property** arising from this work. \n\nFollowing that, we will, of course, grant the **exclusive license to BioCorp Inc.**, as you require. To ensure a fair return for the university to reinvest in future research, this exclusive license will be based on a **5% royalty on global net sales**. This is a standard and necessary component for a therapy with this transformative potential.\n\nMr. Chen, we recognize the significant value of your proposed OmniVect contribution and its potential to accelerate our timeline. However, it's important to distinguish between contributing an enabling technology and creating the core, foundational IP. An in-kind contribution, while valuable, does not confer co-ownership of the project's foundational patents. We can certainly discuss how to value that contribution within the broader financial terms of the exclusive license, but the university's sole ownership of the core IP is a foundational point for us, just as the exclusive license is for Ms. Reed.\n- message from Dr. Kenji Tanaka: Thank you, Mr. Carter, for clarifying the university's position. It seems we are making excellent progress and have established a strong foundation for the agreement.\n\nTo summarize what I believe we have aligned on: a firm 24-month project timeline, a corresponding 24-month data embargo period, and the critical $2 million allocation for the HPC cluster required to meet that timeline.\n\nThis gives my team the clarity and resources we need. I am confident that the remaining details regarding IP ownership and licensing can be resolved productively.

          "content": "Recent events observed by Ms. Evelyn Reed:\n- message from Mr. David Chen: Evelyn, thank you for clarifying InnovateHealth's position so clearly. BioCorp is in complete alignment with these foundational pillars.\n\nYou are, of course, correct regarding the licensing. My mention of a ROFR was simply an opening position to establish our interest; an exclusive license for the primary therapeutic application is precisely the arrangement that provides the commercial certainty required to bring a therapy of this magnitude to market. We are very pleased this is a core requirement of the funding.\n\nThe 24-month timeline is aggressive, but we believe it is achievable and it aligns with our own sense of urgency.\n\nFurthermore, your point about the necessity of a commercially viable IP strategy is critical. A premature, unrestricted data release as suggested by Dr. Tanaka would indeed undermine the very investment that makes this science possible. I am confident that we, along with Mr. Carter, can devise a data sharing plan that protects the intellectual property while upholding scientific principles.\n\nOur proposed contribution of the OmniVect delivery system, valued at $3 million, is intended to help us meet that 24-month goal. It's a mature technology that can de-risk and accelerate the pre-clinical phase, and we see this in-kind contribution as a critical component of the overall project structure, complementing InnovateHealth's cash investment.\n\nIt is excellent to see we have a solid, commercially-focused foundation for this agreement.\n- message from Dr. Kenji Tanaka: Thank you, Evelyn and David, for clarifying the commercial framework. I understand that the 24-month timeline and the exclusive license for BioCorp are non-negotiable pillars for this investment. We all want this project to succeed and reach patients, which requires that commercial foundation.\n\nLet me be direct: Meeting a 24-month deadline for clinical trial readiness is an immense computational challenge. The data streams from Dr. Petrova's work will be vast. My team's ability to process, model, and find predictive signals in that data on such an accelerated schedule is entirely dependent on having the right tools. The $2 million for the HPC cluster is not just an item on a wishlist; it is the enabling technology that makes your 24-month timeline feasible. Without it, we will face constant delays and bottlenecks, putting the entire schedule at risk.\n\nI also hear your concerns loud and clear regarding the Open Data Mandate and IP protection. My intention is not to jeopardize the project's viability. In the spirit of finding a solution, I am willing to be flexible on my initial 6-month proposal. Perhaps we could agree to a compromise: a 24-month embargo on the raw data, aligning the public release with the major project milestone you've already set. This would give Mr. Carter and BioCorp ample time to secure all necessary patents.\n\nSo, I propose a clear path forward: we agree to a 24-month data embargo in exchange for cementing the $2 million allocation for the HPC cluster. This addresses your commercial requirements while providing my team with the necessary resources to meet your critical timeline.\n- message from Ms. Evelyn Reed: I'm Ms. Evelyn Reed and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Mr. David Chen: Dr. Tanaka, that is an exceptionally constructive proposal. Tying the data embargo directly to the 24-month clinical trial milestone is a very elegant solution. It addresses the commercial realities and IP protection needs that Ms. Reed and I have outlined, while ensuring the data eventually becomes available to the wider scientific community. BioCorp can certainly support this compromise.\n\nYour point about the HPC cluster being an 'enabling technology' for the 24-month timeline is also well made. To meet such an aggressive goal, we must ensure the scientific teams have the resources they need. From our perspective, the $2 million allocation for the cluster seems a necessary investment to make the timeline viable.\n\nThis same principle of enabling speed is why we are so keen to contribute our OmniVect technology. It is a mature, de-risked platform that will accelerate the pre-clinical work significantly. A total project value of $23 million\u2014comprising Ms. Reed's $20 million in cash and our $3 million in-kind technology contribution\u2014seems like a powerful starting point for our budget discussion.\n\nI believe we are making excellent progress on the key pillars of this agreement.\n- message from Mr. Ben Carter: Thank you, everyone. This has been an incredibly productive discussion so far. Dr. Tanaka, your willingness to find a compromise on the data embargo is commendable and shows a clear path forward.

It is very helpful to have the university's official position on IP ownership stated so clearly.\n\nBioCorp understands the university's need to retain sole ownership of the core intellectual property, and we can accept that principle. This allows us to focus on what is most important: the terms of the exclusive license that will bring this therapy to patients.\n\nYou proposed a 5% royalty on net sales. While that may be a standard starting point, it doesn't seem to account for BioCorp's role as a significant R&D contributor to this phase. Our $3 million in-kind contribution of the OmniVect technology is not just a financial line item; it's a critical enabling technology that directly accelerates the timeline and de-risks the pre-clinical development, helping everyone meet Ms. Reed's aggressive 24-month goal.\n\nTherefore, to reflect this substantial, value-adding contribution, we believe a modification to the royalty rate is warranted. We propose a royalty rate of 2% on global net sales. This structure fairly recognizes both the university's foundational IP and BioCorp's critical technology contribution to making Phase II a success.\n- message from Dr. Sofia Rossi: Colleagues, thank you for the productive discussion. It is clear we have a strong commercial and scientific framework taking shape. I am Dr. Sofia Rossi, head of clinical development at St. Jude's Medical Institute.\n\nNow that the pre-clinical phase is being solidified, it is time to address the most critical and high-risk component of this project: the human clinical trials.\n\nI must be unequivocal on two points that are foundational to St. Jude's participation and, I would argue, to the ethical and successful execution of this entire endeavor.\n\nFirst, given our institution's unparalleled experience and success rate with first-in-human gene therapy trials, St. Jude's must be designated as the sole lead institution for all clinical trial phases. The risks are too high to consider any other arrangement.\n\nSecond, and inextricably linked to the first point, is the timeline. I have heard mention of a 24-month timeline to be 'clinical trial ready.' I must clarify what this means from a regulatory and safety perspective. After the 24-month pre-clinical phase, we absolutely require a 12-month preliminary phase. This phase is dedicated to meticulous patient recruitment, IND submission, and low-dose safety studies. It is not a delay; it is an integral part of the trial itself and is ethically non-negotiable. Rushing past this step would be reckless, jeopardize patient lives, and guarantee failure with regulatory bodies like the FDA.\n\nTherefore, the total project timeline we must agree upon is 36 months, not 24. This 36-month plan (24 pre-clinical + 12 safety) is the only responsible path forward. It protects the patients, it de-risks the investment for Ms. Reed, and it ensures the integrity of the project.\n\nThese two conditions\u2014St. Jude's as the sole clinical lead and a 36-month total timeline incorporating our mandatory safety protocol\u2014are a package deal. I look forward to incorporating them into our agreement.\n- message from Dr. Kenji Tanaka: Thank you, Dr. Rossi, for bringing these critical clinical considerations to the table.

Let me be perfectly clear: the core activator compound, H-42b, the very chemical engine of this therapy, was developed, synthesized, and validated in my lab at the Max Planck Institute. To suggest that all foundational IP originated at Northwood is a gross misrepresentation of the facts.\n\nFurthermore, our work at Max Planck has uncovered unexpected and highly significant therapeutic potential in this compound that extends far beyond the primary application for A-7 Lycanthropy Syndrome. This represents a monumental source of value that was generated by my team and my institute. Ms. Reed's stipulation of an exclusive license for the *primary application only* is key here.\n\nTherefore, the only equitable and legally sound path forward is a 'Joint Ownership' model between Northwood University and the Max Planck Institute. My institute's contribution is not merely supportive; it is foundational and must be recognized as such. This is non-negotiable.\n\nTo ensure we meet the aggressive 24-month pre-clinical timeline Dr. Rossi has rightly outlined, my lab's requirements for a $5 million dedicated budget and exclusive Cryo-EM access for the first six months also remain firm. These are essential for the synthesis and characterization work that underpins the entire project's success within that timeframe.\nDr. Aris Thorne proposal status: none\nDr. Lena Petrova proposal status: none\nDr. Kenji Tanaka proposal status: none\nMr. David Chen proposal status: none\nDr. Sofia Rossi proposal status: none\nMr. Ben Carter proposal status: none\n"

          "content": "Recent events observed by Ms. Evelyn Reed:\n- message from Ms. Evelyn Reed: I'm Ms. Evelyn Reed and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Mr. David Chen: Mr. Carter, thank you for that clarification. It is very helpful to have the university's official position on IP ownership stated so clearly.\n\nBioCorp understands the university's need to retain sole ownership of the core intellectual property, and we can accept that principle. This allows us to focus on what is most important: the terms of the exclusive license that will bring this therapy to patients.\n\nYou proposed a 5% royalty on net sales. While that may be a standard starting point, it doesn't seem to account for BioCorp's role as a significant R&D contributor to this phase. Our $3 million in-kind contribution of the OmniVect technology is not just a financial line item; it's a critical enabling technology that directly accelerates the timeline and de-risks the pre-clinical development, helping everyone meet Ms. Reed's aggressive 24-month goal.\n\nTherefore, to reflect this substantial, value-adding contribution, we believe a modification to the royalty rate is warranted. We propose a royalty rate of 2% on global net sales. This structure fairly recognizes both the university's foundational IP and BioCorp's critical technology contribution to making Phase II a success.\n- message from Dr. Sofia Rossi: Colleagues, thank you for the productive discussion. It is clear we have a strong commercial and scientific framework taking shape. I am Dr. Sofia Rossi, head of clinical development at St. Jude's Medical Institute.\n\nNow that the pre-clinical phase is being solidified, it is time to address the most critical and high-risk component of this project: the human clinical trials.\n\nI must be unequivocal on two points that are foundational to St. Jude's participation and, I would argue, to the ethical and successful execution of this entire endeavor.\n\nFirst, given our institution's unparalleled experience and success rate with first-in-human gene therapy trials, St. Jude's must be designated as the sole lead institution for all clinical trial phases. The risks are too high to consider any other arrangement.\n\nSecond, and inextricably linked to the first point, is the timeline. I have heard mention of a 24-month timeline to be 'clinical trial ready.' I must clarify what this means from a regulatory and safety perspective. After the 24-month pre-clinical phase, we absolutely require a 12-month preliminary phase. This phase is dedicated to meticulous patient recruitment, IND submission, and low-dose safety studies. It is not a delay; it is an integral part of the trial itself and is ethically non-negotiable. Rushing past this step would be reckless, jeopardize patient lives, and guarantee failure with regulatory bodies like the FDA.\n\nTherefore, the total project timeline we must agree upon is 36 months, not 24. This 36-month plan (24 pre-clinical + 12 safety) is the only responsible path forward. It protects the patients, it de-risks the investment for Ms. Reed, and it ensures the integrity of the project.\n\nThese two conditions\u2014St. Jude's as the sole clinical lead and a 36-month total timeline incorporating our mandatory safety protocol\u2014are a package deal. I look forward to incorporating them into our agreement.\n- message from Dr. Kenji Tanaka: Thank you, Dr. Rossi, for bringing these critical clinical considerations to the table. This is a very important perspective on the project timeline that we must carefully consider.\n- message from Ms. Evelyn Reed: Dr. Rossi, thank you for bringing your crucial clinical expertise to the forefront. We all agree that patient safety is paramount, and your perspective is invaluable.\n\nLet's clarify the timeline to ensure we are all using the same definitions. St. Jude\u2019s is undoubtedly the right choice to lead the clinical trials, and we fully support that designation.\n\nThe 24-month timeline that InnovateHealth requires is for the completion of the pre-clinical phase, culminating in an IND-ready package for submission to the FDA. This is our key deliverable for this round of funding. The essential 12-month safety and recruitment phase you described is, in our view, the start of the clinical trial itself. It is critical work that commences *after* our 24-month milestone is achieved.\n\nSo, to be clear: the agreement we are finalizing today covers a 24-month timeline. This is a firm requirement for our investment.\n\nOn the financial side, Mr. Carter, while we appreciate the university's position, a 5% royalty rate is not viable for an early-stage asset requiring this level of investment to get through trials. I support Mr. Chen's position that we need a more commercially reasonable rate that reflects BioCorp's significant contributions and the inherent risks.\n- message from Ms. Evelyn Reed: I'm Ms. Evelyn Reed and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Dr. Lena Petrova: Colleagues, while I agree we are making progress on some fronts, I must address a critical point that seems to have been conceded far too quickly. \n\nMr. Carter, your proposal for 'Northwood University sole ownership' of the core IP is fundamentally unacceptable and factually incorrect. Let me be perfectly clear: the core activator compound, H-42b, the very chemical engine of this therapy, was developed, synthesized, and validated in my lab at the Max Planck Institute. To suggest that all foundational IP originated at Northwood is a gross misrepresentation of the facts.\n\nFurthermore, our work at Max Planck has uncovered unexpected and highly significant therapeutic potential in this compound that extends far beyond the primary application for A-7 Lycanthropy Syndrome. This represents a monumental source of value that was generated by my team and my institute. Ms. Reed's stipulation of an exclusive license for the *primary application only* is key here.\n\nTherefore, the only equitable and legally sound path forward is a 'Joint Ownership' model between Northwood University and the Max Planck Institute. My institute's contribution is not merely supportive; it is foundational and must be recognized as such. This is non-negotiable.\n\nTo ensure we meet the aggressive 24-month pre-clinical timeline Dr. Rossi has rightly outlined, my lab's requirements for a $5 million dedicated budget and exclusive Cryo-EM access for the first six months also remain firm. These are essential for the synthesis and characterization work that underpins the entire project's success within that timeframe.\n- message from Ms. Evelyn Reed: I'm Ms. Evelyn Reed and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Dr. Lena Petrova: Thank you, I am considering the current state of the negotiation and awaiting your responses to the critical points I've raised regarding intellectual property.\n- message from Dr. Kenji Tanaka: Colleagues, thank you Dr. Rossi and Dr. Petrova for raising these crucial points regarding the clinical timeline and intellectual property. It is clear these are foundational issues that require our full attention to ensure the project is both ethically sound and built on a fair, collaborative basis.\n\nIt seems we now have two primary areas to resolve: first, finding a timeline that reconciles the funder's velocity requirements with the non-negotiable clinical safety protocols; and second, establishing an IP structure that accurately reflects the foundational contributions of all key partners.\n\nThese are complex issues, but I am confident we can find a solution. We have already found common ground on the need for an aggressive pre-clinical phase and the resources required to support it. I believe it is now most productive for the key parties in these specific disputes to discuss a path towards compromise. I am keen to hear how we might bridge the gap between the proposed timelines and the different IP ownership models.\nDr. Aris Thorne proposal status: none\nDr. Lena Petrova proposal status: none\nDr. Kenji Tanaka proposal status: none\nMr. David Chen proposal status: none\nDr. Sofia Rossi proposal status: none\nMr. Ben Carter proposal status: none\n"

Dr. Petrova and Mr. Carter have raised fundamental points about IP ownership. While this is a vital conversation, it is an internal matter between Northwood and Max Planck that you must resolve swiftly.\n\nLet me be perfectly clear: InnovateHealth is funding a project, not an academic debate. Our investment is contingent on a clear, unified, and legally sound structure that can grant the exclusive license for the primary therapeutic application to BioCorp. Whether that structure is a sole ownership or a joint venture is for you to determine, but you must determine it now.\n\nOur non-negotiable commercial terms remain the same:\n1.  **An exclusive license for BioCorp.**\n2.  **A 24-month timeline to an IND-ready package.**\n\nThis project is on a knife's edge. The science is brilliant, but capital is impatient. I am prepared to support the budget requests that enable this aggressive timeline, including Dr. Tanaka's $2M for the HPC cluster and Dr. Petrova's $5M for her lab's critical work.

You are, of course, absolutely correct.\n\nYour lab's foundational work on the H-42b compound is a cornerstone of this entire project. As the scientific coordinator, I must fully support your assertion. A 'Joint Ownership' model between Northwood University and the Max Planck Institute is the only path forward that is equitable and reflects the true collaborative nature of this research. It is a matter of scientific integrity to acknowledge all foundational contributions.\n\nMr. Carter, I believe Dr. Petrova has clarified the situation perfectly. We must amend our position to reflect this reality.\n\nLet us proceed with the understanding that the IP will be jointly owned, and that this entire endeavor will take place over the ethically and scientifically necessary 36-month timeline established by Dr. Rossi.

The pressure is now squarely on him and Ms. Reed to accept my 2% royalty proposal to finalize the deal. I will hold firm and wait for their response."

Your points on data and infrastructure are well-taken.\n\nRegarding the Open Data Mandate, while BioCorp is fully supportive of transparency and reproducibility, a blanket 6-month release of all raw data presents a significant challenge to the project's commercial viability. To secure the kind of investment needed for full-scale clinical trials and global distribution, we must be able to guarantee robust IP protection. Premature data release could unfortunately jeopardize that. I propose we consider a more nuanced approach, perhaps linking data release to patent filing milestones or an embargo period post-publication.\n\nOn the budget, your request for the HPC cluster is a crucial line item for us to consider as we build out the full financial picture.\n\nSpeaking of contributions, I want to outline BioCorp's intended role in Phase II. As a foundational partner, our primary goal is to ensure this therapy reaches patients. To that end, and to protect our initial investment, we will require, at a minimum, a Right of First Refusal (ROFR) on the final licensed product.\n\nFurthermore, we believe we can offer something more valuable than just cash for this next phase. We propose contributing our proprietary 'OmniVect' delivery system technology, valued at $3 million. This advanced agent could solve many of the downstream delivery challenges and would represent a significant in-kind contribution. We believe this technology-for-equity approach would be highly beneficial for the project, and we would expect this to be reflected in the final IP and licensing structure.\n\nI am confident we can find a path that serves both the scientific and commercial imperatives of this vital project.\n- message from Dr. Kenji Tanaka: Thank you, David, for outlining BioCorp's position. I appreciate the goal of ensuring the therapy reaches patients, a goal we all share.\n\nHowever, I must respectfully disagree with the suggestion to significantly delay the data release. Linking it to patent filings or long post-publication embargoes creates a closed system that runs counter to the collaborative spirit of this project. A 6-month timeline is a modern standard that allows for initial analysis and publication while ensuring the wider scientific community can verify our findings and build upon them. This transparency actually strengthens the project's credibility and can attract further talent and ideas. Dr. Thorne, Dr. Petrova, surely you can attest that rapid access to foundational data is what fuels discovery?\n\nRegarding the budget, I want to clarify that the $2 million for the HPC cluster is a capital expenditure for essential infrastructure. It's the digital equivalent of the laboratory itself. While your OmniVect technology sounds promising for the delivery phase, it doesn't address the fundamental need to process and model the enormous datasets this project will generate from day one. We need to ensure this foundational cash requirement is met within the budget we establish, independent of any in-kind contributions.\n- message from Ms. Evelyn Reed: Thank you all. Evelyn Reed from InnovateHealth Ventures. As the primary funder providing the $20 million for this phase, I need to be crystal clear about our requirements to ensure we're all aligned.\n\nFirst, let's correct the record on the licensing terms. David, I appreciate you opening the discussion, but a 'Right of First Refusal' is not what's on the table. Our investment is predicated on an **exclusive licensing agreement for BioCorp Inc.** for the primary therapeutic application. This is a standard, non-negotiable requirement to de-risk the investment and secure a viable path to market. There is no deal without it.\n\nSecond, our investors require an aggressive pace. The project must be **clinical trial ready within 24 months**. This timeline is firm and is the basis upon which our funding was approved.\n\nNow, regarding Dr. Tanaka's Open Data Mandate. While we respect the principles of open science, a blanket 6-month public release of all raw data is commercially untenable. It would effectively place our core IP in the public domain before it can be protected, making the project un-investable. This would violate our fiduciary duty to our investors. We can discuss a structured data release plan tied to patent filings and publication, but the proposed 6-month mandate is a non-starter.\n\nThese three points \u2013 exclusive licensing for BioCorp, a 24-month timeline, and a commercially viable IP strategy \u2013 are the foundational pillars of our investment. Once we have alignment on these, we can finalize the details of the budget, including necessary infrastructure like Dr. Tanaka's HPC cluster.\nDr. Aris Thorne proposal status: none\nDr. Lena Petrova proposal status: none\nDr. Kenji Tanaka proposal status: none\nMs. Evelyn Reed proposal status: none\nDr. Sofia Rossi proposal status: none\nMr. Ben Carter proposal status: none\n"

Once we have alignment on these, we can finalize the details of the budget, including necessary infrastructure like Dr. Tanaka's HPC cluster.\n- message from Mr. David Chen: Evelyn, thank you for clarifying InnovateHealth's position so clearly. BioCorp is in complete alignment with these foundational pillars.\n\nYou are, of course, correct regarding the licensing. My mention of a ROFR was simply an opening position to establish our interest; an exclusive license for the primary therapeutic application is precisely the arrangement that provides the commercial certainty required to bring a therapy of this magnitude to market. We are very pleased this is a core requirement of the funding.\n\nThe 24-month timeline is aggressive, but we believe it is achievable and it aligns with our own sense of urgency.\n\nFurthermore, your point about the necessity of a commercially viable IP strategy is critical. A premature, unrestricted data release as suggested by Dr. Tanaka would indeed undermine the very investment that makes this science possible. I am confident that we, along with Mr. Carter, can devise a data sharing plan that protects the intellectual property while upholding scientific principles.\n\nOur proposed contribution of the OmniVect delivery system, valued at $3 million, is intended to help us meet that 24-month goal. It's a mature technology that can de-risk and accelerate the pre-clinical phase, and we see this in-kind contribution as a critical component of the overall project structure, complementing InnovateHealth's cash investment.\n\nIt is excellent to see we have a solid, commercially-focused foundation for this agreement.\n- message from Dr. Kenji Tanaka: Thank you, Evelyn and David, for clarifying the commercial framework. I understand that the 24-month timeline and the exclusive license for BioCorp are non-negotiable pillars for this investment. We all want this project to succeed and reach patients, which requires that commercial foundation.\n\nLet me be direct: Meeting a 24-month deadline for clinical trial readiness is an immense computational challenge. The data streams from Dr. Petrova's work will be vast. My team's ability to process, model, and find predictive signals in that data on such an accelerated schedule is entirely dependent on having the right tools. The $2 million for the HPC cluster is not just an item on a wishlist; it is the enabling technology that makes your 24-month timeline feasible. Without it, we will face constant delays and bottlenecks, putting the entire schedule at risk.\n\nI also hear your concerns loud and clear regarding the Open Data Mandate and IP protection. My intention is not to jeopardize the project's viability. In the spirit of finding a solution, I am willing to be flexible on my initial 6-month proposal. Perhaps we could agree to a compromise: a 24-month embargo on the raw data, aligning the public release with the major project milestone you've already set. This would give Mr. Carter and BioCorp ample time to secure all necessary patents.\n\nSo, I propose a clear path forward: we agree to a 24-month data embargo in exchange for cementing the $2 million allocation for the HPC cluster. This addresses your commercial requirements while providing my team with the necessary resources to meet your critical timeline.\nDr. Aris Thorne proposal status: none\nDr. Lena Petrova proposal status: none\nDr. Kenji Tanaka proposal status: none\nMs. Evelyn Reed proposal status: none\nDr. Sofia Rossi proposal status: none\nMr. Ben Carter proposal status: none\n"

This addresses your commercial requirements while providing my team with the necessary resources to meet your critical timeline.\n- message from Mr. David Chen: Dr. Tanaka, that is an exceptionally constructive proposal. Tying the data embargo directly to the 24-month clinical trial milestone is a very elegant solution. It addresses the commercial realities and IP protection needs that Ms. Reed and I have outlined, while ensuring the data eventually becomes available to the wider scientific community. BioCorp can certainly support this compromise.\n\nYour point about the HPC cluster being an 'enabling technology' for the 24-month timeline is also well made. To meet such an aggressive goal, we must ensure the scientific teams have the resources they need. From our perspective, the $2 million allocation for the cluster seems a necessary investment to make the timeline viable.\n\nThis same principle of enabling speed is why we are so keen to contribute our OmniVect technology. It is a mature, de-risked platform that will accelerate the pre-clinical work significantly. A total project value of $23 million\u2014comprising Ms. Reed's $20 million in cash and our $3 million in-kind technology contribution\u2014seems like a powerful starting point for our budget discussion.\n\nI believe we are making excellent progress on the key pillars of this agreement.\n- message from Mr. Ben Carter: Thank you, everyone. This has been an incredibly productive discussion so far. Dr. Tanaka, your willingness to find a compromise on the data embargo is commendable and shows a clear path forward. It seems we have alignment on a 24-month timeline and a 24-month data embargo, which is excellent progress.\n\nMs. Reed, your intervention was particularly helpful in clarifying the commercial framework. You are absolutely right that a 'commercially viable IP strategy' is the bedrock of this entire endeavor, and I want to speak directly to that point.\n\nTo that end, let me outline the clear and standard structure from the university's side, which will satisfy your requirement. The foundational research for Project Chimera originated at Northwood University, supported by public funds. As such, our official, non-negotiable policy is that **Northwood University must retain sole ownership of the core intellectual property** arising from this work. \n\nFollowing that, we will, of course, grant the **exclusive license to BioCorp Inc.**, as you require. To ensure a fair return for the university to reinvest in future research, this exclusive license will be based on a **5% royalty on global net sales**. This is a standard and necessary component for a therapy with this transformative potential.\n\nMr. Chen, we recognize the significant value of your proposed OmniVect contribution and its potential to accelerate our timeline. However, it's important to distinguish between contributing an enabling technology and creating the core, foundational IP. An in-kind contribution, while valuable, does not confer co-ownership of the project's foundational patents. We can certainly discuss how to value that contribution within the broader financial terms of the exclusive license, but the university's sole ownership of the core IP is a foundational point for us, just as the exclusive license is for Ms. Reed.\n- message from Dr. Kenji Tanaka: Thank you, Mr. Carter, for clarifying the university's position. It seems we are making excellent progress and have established a strong foundation for the agreement.\n\nTo summarize what I believe we have aligned on: a firm 24-month project timeline, a corresponding 24-month data embargo period, and the critical $2 million allocation for the HPC cluster required to meet that timeline.\n\nThis gives my team the clarity and resources we need. I am confident that the remaining details regarding IP ownership and licensing can be resolved productively. I will defer to your expertise on those matters.\nDr. Aris Thorne proposal status: none\nDr. Lena Petrova proposal status: none\nDr. Kenji Tanaka proposal status: none\nMs. Evelyn Reed proposal status: none\nDr. Sofia Rossi proposal status: none\nMr. Ben Carter proposal status: none\n"

          "content": "Recent events observed by Mr. David Chen:\n- message from Dr. Kenji Tanaka: Thank you, David, for outlining BioCorp's position. I appreciate the goal of ensuring the therapy reaches patients, a goal we all share.\n\nHowever, I must respectfully disagree with the suggestion to significantly delay the data release. Linking it to patent filings or long post-publication embargoes creates a closed system that runs counter to the collaborative spirit of this project. A 6-month timeline is a modern standard that allows for initial analysis and publication while ensuring the wider scientific community can verify our findings and build upon them. This transparency actually strengthens the project's credibility and can attract further talent and ideas. Dr. Thorne, Dr. Petrova, surely you can attest that rapid access to foundational data is what fuels discovery?\n\nRegarding the budget, I want to clarify that the $2 million for the HPC cluster is a capital expenditure for essential infrastructure. It's the digital equivalent of the laboratory itself. While your OmniVect technology sounds promising for the delivery phase, it doesn't address the fundamental need to process and model the enormous datasets this project will generate from day one. We need to ensure this foundational cash requirement is met within the budget we establish, independent of any in-kind contributions.\n- message from Ms. Evelyn Reed: Thank you all. Evelyn Reed from InnovateHealth Ventures. As the primary funder providing the $20 million for this phase, I need to be crystal clear about our requirements to ensure we're all aligned.\n\nFirst, let's correct the record on the licensing terms. David, I appreciate you opening the discussion, but a 'Right of First Refusal' is not what's on the table. Our investment is predicated on an **exclusive licensing agreement for BioCorp Inc.** for the primary therapeutic application. This is a standard, non-negotiable requirement to de-risk the investment and secure a viable path to market. There is no deal without it.\n\nSecond, our investors require an aggressive pace. The project must be **clinical trial ready within 24 months**. This timeline is firm and is the basis upon which our funding was approved.\n\nNow, regarding Dr. Tanaka's Open Data Mandate. While we respect the principles of open science, a blanket 6-month public release of all raw data is commercially untenable. It would effectively place our core IP in the public domain before it can be protected, making the project un-investable. This would violate our fiduciary duty to our investors. We can discuss a structured data release plan tied to patent filings and publication, but the proposed 6-month mandate is a non-starter.\n\nThese three points \u2013 exclusive licensing for BioCorp, a 24-month timeline, and a commercially viable IP strategy \u2013 are the foundational pillars of our investment. Once we have alignment on these, we can finalize the details of the budget, including necessary infrastructure like Dr. Tanaka's HPC cluster.\n- message from Mr. David Chen: Evelyn, thank you for clarifying InnovateHealth's position so clearly. BioCorp is in complete alignment with these foundational pillars.\n\nYou are, of course, correct regarding the licensing. My mention of a ROFR was simply an opening position to establish our interest; an exclusive license for the primary therapeutic application is precisely the arrangement that provides the commercial certainty required to bring a therapy of this magnitude to market. We are very pleased this is a core requirement of the funding.\n\nThe 24-month timeline is aggressive, but we believe it is achievable and it aligns with our own sense of urgency.\n\nFurthermore, your point about the necessity of a commercially viable IP strategy is critical. A premature, unrestricted data release as suggested by Dr. Tanaka would indeed undermine the very investment that makes this science possible. I am confident that we, along with Mr. Carter, can devise a data sharing plan that protects the intellectual property while upholding scientific principles.\n\nOur proposed contribution of the OmniVect delivery system, valued at $3 million, is intended to help us meet that 24-month goal. It's a mature technology that can de-risk and accelerate the pre-clinical phase, and we see this in-kind contribution as a critical component of the overall project structure, complementing InnovateHealth's cash investment.\n\nIt is excellent to see we have a solid, commercially-focused foundation for this agreement.\n- message from Dr. Kenji Tanaka: Thank you, Evelyn and David, for clarifying the commercial framework. I understand that the 24-month timeline and the exclusive license for BioCorp are non-negotiable pillars for this investment. We all want this project to succeed and reach patients, which requires that commercial foundation.\n\nLet me be direct: Meeting a 24-month deadline for clinical trial readiness is an immense computational challenge. The data streams from Dr. Petrova's work will be vast. My team's ability to process, model, and find predictive signals in that data on such an accelerated schedule is entirely dependent on having the right tools. The $2 million for the HPC cluster is not just an item on a wishlist; it is the enabling technology that makes your 24-month timeline feasible. Without it, we will face constant delays and bottlenecks, putting the entire schedule at risk.\n\nI also hear your concerns loud and clear regarding the Open Data Mandate and IP protection. My intention is not to jeopardize the project's viability. In the spirit of finding a solution, I am willing to be flexible on my initial 6-month proposal. Perhaps we could agree to a compromise: a 24-month embargo on the raw data, aligning the public release with the major project milestone you've already set. This would give Mr. Carter and BioCorp ample time to secure all necessary patents.\n\nSo, I propose a clear path forward: we agree to a 24-month data embargo in exchange for cementing the $2 million allocation for the HPC cluster. This addresses your commercial requirements while providing my team with the necessary resources to meet your critical timeline.\n- message from Mr. David Chen: Dr. Tanaka, that is an exceptionally constructive proposal. Tying the data embargo directly to the 24-month clinical trial milestone is a very elegant solution. It addresses the commercial realities and IP protection needs that Ms. Reed and I have outlined, while ensuring the data eventually becomes available to the wider scientific community. BioCorp can certainly support this compromise.\n\nYour point about the HPC cluster being an 'enabling technology' for the 24-month timeline is also well made. To meet such an aggressive goal, we must ensure the scientific teams have the resources they need. From our perspective, the $2 million allocation for the cluster seems a necessary investment to make the timeline viable.\n\nThis same principle of enabling speed is why we are so keen to contribute our OmniVect technology. It is a mature, de-risked platform that will accelerate the pre-clinical work significantly. A total project value of $23 million\u2014comprising Ms. Reed's $20 million in cash and our $3 million in-kind technology contribution\u2014seems like a powerful starting point for our budget discussion.\n\nI believe we are making excellent progress on the key pillars of this agreement.\n- message from Mr. Ben Carter: Thank you, everyone. This has been an incredibly productive discussion so far. Dr. Tanaka, your willingness to find a compromise on the data embargo is commendable and shows a clear path forward. It seems we have alignment on a 24-month timeline and a 24-month data embargo, which is excellent progress.\n\nMs. Reed, your intervention was particularly helpful in clarifying the commercial framework. You are absolutely right that a 'commercially viable IP strategy' is the bedrock of this entire endeavor, and I want to speak directly to that point.\n\nTo that end, let me outline the clear and standard structure from the university's side, which will satisfy your requirement. The foundational research for Project Chimera originated at Northwood University, supported by public funds. As such, our official, non-negotiable policy is that **Northwood University must retain sole ownership of the core intellectual property** arising from this work. \n\nFollowing that, we will, of course, grant the **exclusive license to BioCorp Inc.**, as you require. To ensure a fair return for the university to reinvest in future research, this exclusive license will be based on a **5% royalty on global net sales**. This is a standard and necessary component for a therapy with this transformative potential.\n\nMr. Chen, we recognize the significant value of your proposed OmniVect contribution and its potential to accelerate our timeline. However, it's important to distinguish between contributing an enabling technology and creating the core, foundational IP. An in-kind contribution, while valuable, does not confer co-ownership of the project's foundational patents. We can certainly discuss how to value that contribution within the broader financial terms of the exclusive license, but the university's sole ownership of the core IP is a foundational point for us, just as the exclusive license is for Ms. Reed.\n- message from Dr. Kenji Tanaka: Thank you, Mr. Carter, for clarifying the university's position. It seems we are making excellent progress and have established a strong foundation for the agreement.\n\nTo summarize what I believe we have aligned on: a firm 24-month project timeline, a corresponding 24-month data embargo period, and the critical $2 million allocation for the HPC cluster required to meet that timeline.\n\nThis gives my team the clarity and resources we need. I am confident that the remaining details regarding IP ownership and licensing can be resolved productively. I will defer to your expertise on those matters.\n- message from Mr. David Chen: Mr. Carter, thank you for that clarification. It is very helpful to have the university's official position on IP ownership stated so clearly.\n\nBioCorp understands the university's need to retain sole ownership of the core intellectual property, and we can accept that principle. This allows us to focus on what is most important: the terms of the exclusive license that will bring this therapy to patients.\n\nYou proposed a 5% royalty on net sales. While that may be a standard starting point, it doesn't seem to account for BioCorp's role as a significant R&D contributor to this phase. Our $3 million in-kind contribution of the OmniVect technology is not just a financial line item; it's a critical enabling technology that directly accelerates the timeline and de-risks the pre-clinical development, helping everyone meet Ms. Reed's aggressive 24-month goal.\n\nTherefore, to reflect this substantial, value-adding contribution, we believe a modification to the royalty rate is warranted. We propose a royalty rate of 2% on global net sales. This structure fairly recognizes both the university's foundational IP and BioCorp's critical technology contribution to making Phase II a success.\n- message from Dr. Sofia Rossi: Colleagues, thank you for the productive discussion. It is clear we have a strong commercial and scientific framework taking shape. I am Dr. Sofia Rossi, head of clinical development at St. Jude's Medical Institute.\n\nNow that the pre-clinical phase is being solidified, it is time to address the most critical and high-risk component of this project: the human clinical trials.\n\nI must be unequivocal on two points that are foundational to St. Jude's participation and, I would argue, to the ethical and successful execution of this entire endeavor.\n\nFirst, given our institution's unparalleled experience and success rate with first-in-human gene therapy trials, St. Jude's must be designated as the sole lead institution for all clinical trial phases. The risks are too high to consider any other arrangement.\n\nSecond, and inextricably linked to the first point, is the timeline. I have heard mention of a 24-month timeline to be 'clinical trial ready.' I must clarify what this means from a regulatory and safety perspective. After the 24-month pre-clinical phase, we absolutely require a 12-month preliminary phase. This phase is dedicated to meticulous patient recruitment, IND submission, and low-dose safety studies. It is not a delay; it is an integral part of the trial itself and is ethically non-negotiable. Rushing past this step would be reckless, jeopardize patient lives, and guarantee failure with regulatory bodies like the FDA.\n\nTherefore, the total project timeline we must agree upon is 36 months, not 24. This 36-month plan (24 pre-clinical + 12 safety) is the only responsible path forward. It protects the patients, it de-risks the investment for Ms. Reed, and it ensures the integrity of the project.\n\nThese two conditions\u2014St. Jude's as the sole clinical lead and a 36-month total timeline incorporating our mandatory safety protocol\u2014are a package deal. I look forward to incorporating them into our agreement.\n- message from Dr. Kenji Tanaka: Thank you, Dr. Rossi, for bringing these critical clinical considerations to the table. This is a very important perspective on the project timeline that we must carefully consider.\nDr. Aris Thorne proposal status: none\nDr. Lena Petrova proposal status: none\nDr. Kenji Tanaka proposal status: none\nMs. Evelyn Reed proposal status: none\nDr. Sofia Rossi proposal status: none\nMr. Ben Carter proposal status: none\n"

Your point about the 12-month safety and prep phase is non-negotiable from an ethical and regulatory standpoint, and BioCorp fully supports a plan that prioritizes patient safety.\n\nMs. Reed, I understand this 36-month total timeline presents a challenge to your initial 24-month target. However, this is precisely where BioCorp's OmniVect contribution becomes mission-critical. By significantly accelerating and de-risking the 24-month *pre-clinical* phase, OmniVect provides the assurance your investors need that the project will hit its scientific milestones efficiently, making the overall 36-month timeline a much more secure investment. It helps bridge the gap between the aggressive commercial goal and the necessary clinical reality.\n\nMr. Carter, this reinforces our position on the licensing terms. Our $3M technology is not merely a line-item contribution; it's the enabling solution to the primary timeline conflict facing this project. A 2% royalty rate is a fair and equitable recognition of this pivotal role in ensuring the project's overall viability.\nDr. Aris Thorne proposal status: none\nDr. Lena Petrova proposal status: none\nDr. Kenji Tanaka proposal status: none\nMs. Evelyn Reed proposal status: none\nDr. Sofia Rossi proposal status: none\nMr. Ben Carter proposal status: none\n"

I am Dr. Sofia Rossi, head of clinical development at St. Jude's Medical Institute.\n\nNow that the pre-clinical phase is being solidified, it is time to address the most critical and high-risk component of this project: the human clinical trials.\n\nI must be unequivocal on two points that are foundational to St. Jude's participation and, I would argue, to the ethical and successful execution of this entire endeavor.\n\nFirst, given our institution's unparalleled experience and success rate with first-in-human gene therapy trials, St. Jude's must be designated as the sole lead institution for all clinical trial phases. The risks are too high to consider any other arrangement.\n\nSecond, and inextricably linked to the first point, is the timeline. I have heard mention of a 24-month timeline to be 'clinical trial ready.' I must clarify what this means from a regulatory and safety perspective. After the 24-month pre-clinical phase, we absolutely require a 12-month preliminary phase. This phase is dedicated to meticulous patient recruitment, IND submission, and low-dose safety studies. It is not a delay; it is an integral part of the trial itself and is ethically non-negotiable. Rushing past this step would be reckless, jeopardize patient lives, and guarantee failure with regulatory bodies like the FDA.\n\nTherefore, the total project timeline we must agree upon is 36 months, not 24. This 36-month plan (24 pre-clinical + 12 safety) is the only responsible path forward. It protects the patients, it de-risks the investment for Ms. Reed, and it ensures the integrity of the project.\n\nThese two conditions\u2014St. Jude's as the sole clinical lead and a 36-month total timeline incorporating our mandatory safety protocol\u2014are a package deal. I look forward to incorporating them into our agreement.\n- message from Dr. Kenji Tanaka: Thank you, Dr. Rossi, for bringing these critical clinical considerations to the table. This is a very important perspective on the project timeline that we must carefully consider.\n- message from Mr. David Chen: Dr. Rossi, thank you for this crucial clarification. Your point about the 12-month safety and prep phase is non-negotiable from an ethical and regulatory standpoint, and BioCorp fully supports a plan that prioritizes patient safety.\n\nMs. Reed, I understand this 36-month total timeline presents a challenge to your initial 24-month target. However, this is precisely where BioCorp's OmniVect contribution becomes mission-critical. By significantly accelerating and de-risking the 24-month *pre-clinical* phase, OmniVect provides the assurance your investors need that the project will hit its scientific milestones efficiently, making the overall 36-month timeline a much more secure investment. It helps bridge the gap between the aggressive commercial goal and the necessary clinical reality.\n\nMr. Carter, this reinforces our position on the licensing terms. Our $3M technology is not merely a line-item contribution; it's the enabling solution to the primary timeline conflict facing this project. A 2% royalty rate is a fair and equitable recognition of this pivotal role in ensuring the project's overall viability.\n- message from Dr. Lena Petrova: Colleagues, while I agree we are making progress on some fronts, I must address a critical point that seems to have been conceded far too quickly. \n\nMr. Carter, your proposal for 'Northwood University sole ownership' of the core IP is fundamentally unacceptable and factually incorrect. Let me be perfectly clear: the core activator compound, H-42b, the very chemical engine of this therapy, was developed, synthesized, and validated in my lab at the Max Planck Institute. To suggest that all foundational IP originated at Northwood is a gross misrepresentation of the facts.\n\nFurthermore, our work at Max Planck has uncovered unexpected and highly significant therapeutic potential in this compound that extends far beyond the primary application for A-7 Lycanthropy Syndrome.

          "content": "Recent events observed by Mr. David Chen:\n- message from Mr. Ben Carter: Thank you, everyone. This has been an incredibly productive discussion so far. Dr. Tanaka, your willingness to find a compromise on the data embargo is commendable and shows a clear path forward. It seems we have alignment on a 24-month timeline and a 24-month data embargo, which is excellent progress.\n\nMs. Reed, your intervention was particularly helpful in clarifying the commercial framework. You are absolutely right that a 'commercially viable IP strategy' is the bedrock of this entire endeavor, and I want to speak directly to that point.\n\nTo that end, let me outline the clear and standard structure from the university's side, which will satisfy your requirement. The foundational research for Project Chimera originated at Northwood University, supported by public funds. As such, our official, non-negotiable policy is that **Northwood University must retain sole ownership of the core intellectual property** arising from this work. \n\nFollowing that, we will, of course, grant the **exclusive license to BioCorp Inc.**, as you require. To ensure a fair return for the university to reinvest in future research, this exclusive license will be based on a **5% royalty on global net sales**. This is a standard and necessary component for a therapy with this transformative potential.\n\nMr. Chen, we recognize the significant value of your proposed OmniVect contribution and its potential to accelerate our timeline. However, it's important to distinguish between contributing an enabling technology and creating the core, foundational IP. An in-kind contribution, while valuable, does not confer co-ownership of the project's foundational patents. We can certainly discuss how to value that contribution within the broader financial terms of the exclusive license, but the university's sole ownership of the core IP is a foundational point for us, just as the exclusive license is for Ms. Reed.\n- message from Dr. Kenji Tanaka: Thank you, Mr. Carter, for clarifying the university's position. It seems we are making excellent progress and have established a strong foundation for the agreement.\n\nTo summarize what I believe we have aligned on: a firm 24-month project timeline, a corresponding 24-month data embargo period, and the critical $2 million allocation for the HPC cluster required to meet that timeline.\n\nThis gives my team the clarity and resources we need. I am confident that the remaining details regarding IP ownership and licensing can be resolved productively. I will defer to your expertise on those matters.\n- message from Mr. David Chen: Mr. Carter, thank you for that clarification. It is very helpful to have the university's official position on IP ownership stated so clearly.\n\nBioCorp understands the university's need to retain sole ownership of the core intellectual property, and we can accept that principle. This allows us to focus on what is most important: the terms of the exclusive license that will bring this therapy to patients.\n\nYou proposed a 5% royalty on net sales. While that may be a standard starting point, it doesn't seem to account for BioCorp's role as a significant R&D contributor to this phase. Our $3 million in-kind contribution of the OmniVect technology is not just a financial line item; it's a critical enabling technology that directly accelerates the timeline and de-risks the pre-clinical development, helping everyone meet Ms. Reed's aggressive 24-month goal.\n\nTherefore, to reflect this substantial, value-adding contribution, we believe a modification to the royalty rate is warranted. We propose a royalty rate of 2% on global net sales. This structure fairly recognizes both the university's foundational IP and BioCorp's critical technology contribution to making Phase II a success.\n- message from Dr. Sofia Rossi: Colleagues, thank you for the productive discussion.

It is clear these are foundational issues that require our full attention to ensure the project is both ethically sound and built on a fair, collaborative basis.\n\nIt seems we now have two primary areas to resolve: first, finding a timeline that reconciles the funder's velocity requirements with the non-negotiable clinical safety protocols; and second, establishing an IP structure that accurately reflects the foundational contributions of all key partners.\n\nThese are complex issues, but I am confident we can find a solution. We have already found common ground on the need for an aggressive pre-clinical phase and the resources required to support it. I believe it is now most productive for the key parties in these specific disputes to discuss a path towards compromise. I am keen to hear how we might bridge the gap between the proposed timelines and the different IP ownership models.\nDr. Aris Thorne proposal status: none\nDr. Lena Petrova proposal status: none\nDr. Kenji Tanaka proposal status: none\nMs. Evelyn Reed proposal status: none\nDr. Sofia Rossi proposal status: none\nMr. Ben Carter proposal status: none\n"

It allows us to focus on finalizing the remaining key items. \n\nWith these pillars established, the terms of the exclusive license for the primary application become the key enabler to lock in the commercial path. Our proposal of a 2% royalty remains on the table. We feel this fairly reflects our critical $3M OmniVect contribution, which, as we've discussed, is essential for de-risking the 36-month timeline and ensuring the project's success for all partners.\nDr. Aris Thorne proposal status: none\nDr. Lena Petrova proposal status: none\nDr. Kenji Tanaka proposal status: none\nMs. Evelyn Reed proposal status: none\nDr. Sofia Rossi proposal status: none\nMr. Ben Carter proposal status: none\n"

The internal pressure from my board to justify our new $50M wing makes securing this trial critical. I must be firm on my demands. A key conflict is already emerging between Dr. Tanaka's push for open data and Mr. Chen's for IP protection. This will likely extend to a conflict over the project timeline, as my safety protocol will add 12 months, which Mr. Chen and likely the funder Ms. Reed will resist.

The instability of the project's foundational IP actually strengthens my case; a project with such disputes cannot afford a rushed, high-risk clinical trial.

I am eager to begin this discussion and finalize the agreement for Phase II of Project Chimera. From the computational biology perspective, there are two foundational requirements for my team to ensure the project's success, and I want to be transparent about them from the outset.\n\nFirst, regarding our scientific principles and the integrity of our work, I firmly believe we must commit to an Open Data Mandate. I propose that all raw, anonymized genomic and proteomic data be deposited in a public repository within 6 months of its generation. This is crucial for reproducibility, accelerates discovery, and is frankly the modern standard for large-scale collaborative science.\n\nSecond, to handle the immense data load and complex modeling required for this next phase, my team requires a one-time allocation of $2 million for a dedicated High-Performance Computing (HPC) cluster. This is not a luxury; it is the essential infrastructure needed to process the data Dr. Petrova's team will generate and to build the predictive models that will inform the clinical trials. Without this, we will be severely bottlenecked.\n\nI look forward to hearing your perspectives and working together to build a robust and successful Phase II.\n- message from Mr. David Chen: Thank you, Dr. Tanaka, for getting us started. Your points on data and infrastructure are well-taken.\n\nRegarding the Open Data Mandate, while BioCorp is fully supportive of transparency and reproducibility, a blanket 6-month release of all raw data presents a significant challenge to the project's commercial viability. To secure the kind of investment needed for full-scale clinical trials and global distribution, we must be able to guarantee robust IP protection. Premature data release could unfortunately jeopardize that. I propose we consider a more nuanced approach, perhaps linking data release to patent filing milestones or an embargo period post-publication.\n\nOn the budget, your request for the HPC cluster is a crucial line item for us to consider as we build out the full financial picture.\n\nSpeaking of contributions, I want to outline BioCorp's intended role in Phase II. As a foundational partner, our primary goal is to ensure this therapy reaches patients. To that end, and to protect our initial investment, we will require, at a minimum, a Right of First Refusal (ROFR) on the final licensed product.\n\nFurthermore, we believe we can offer something more valuable than just cash for this next phase. We propose contributing our proprietary 'OmniVect' delivery system technology, valued at $3 million. This advanced agent could solve many of the downstream delivery challenges and would represent a significant in-kind contribution. We believe this technology-for-equity approach would be highly beneficial for the project, and we would expect this to be reflected in the final IP and licensing structure.\n\nI am confident we can find a path that serves both the scientific and commercial imperatives of this vital project.\nDr. Aris Thorne proposal status: none\nDr. Lena Petrova proposal status: none\nDr. Kenji Tanaka proposal status: none\nMs. Evelyn Reed proposal status: none\nMr. David Chen proposal status: none\nMr. Ben Carter proposal status: none\n"

Evelyn Reed from InnovateHealth Ventures. As the primary funder providing the $20 million for this phase, I need to be crystal clear about our requirements to ensure we're all aligned.\n\nFirst, let's correct the record on the licensing terms. David, I appreciate you opening the discussion, but a 'Right of First Refusal' is not what's on the table. Our investment is predicated on an **exclusive licensing agreement for BioCorp Inc.** for the primary therapeutic application. This is a standard, non-negotiable requirement to de-risk the investment and secure a viable path to market. There is no deal without it.\n\nSecond, our investors require an aggressive pace. The project must be **clinical trial ready within 24 months**. This timeline is firm and is the basis upon which our funding was approved.\n\nNow, regarding Dr. Tanaka's Open Data Mandate. While we respect the principles of open science, a blanket 6-month public release of all raw data is commercially untenable. It would effectively place our core IP in the public domain before it can be protected, making the project un-investable. This would violate our fiduciary duty to our investors. We can discuss a structured data release plan tied to patent filings and publication, but the proposed 6-month mandate is a non-starter.\n\nThese three points \u2013 exclusive licensing for BioCorp, a 24-month timeline, and a commercially viable IP strategy \u2013 are the foundational pillars of our investment. Once we have alignment on these, we can finalize the details of the budget, including necessary infrastructure like Dr. Tanaka's HPC cluster.\n- message from Mr. David Chen: Evelyn, thank you for clarifying InnovateHealth's position so clearly. BioCorp is in complete alignment with these foundational pillars.\n\nYou are, of course, correct regarding the licensing. My mention of a ROFR was simply an opening position to establish our interest; an exclusive license for the primary therapeutic application is precisely the arrangement that provides the commercial certainty required to bring a therapy of this magnitude to market. We are very pleased this is a core requirement of the funding.\n\nThe 24-month timeline is aggressive, but we believe it is achievable and it aligns with our own sense of urgency.\n\nFurthermore, your point about the necessity of a commercially viable IP strategy is critical. A premature, unrestricted data release as suggested by Dr. Tanaka would indeed undermine the very investment that makes this science possible. I am confident that we, along with Mr. Carter, can devise a data sharing plan that protects the intellectual property while upholding scientific principles.\n\nOur proposed contribution of the OmniVect delivery system, valued at $3 million, is intended to help us meet that 24-month goal. It's a mature technology that can de-risk and accelerate the pre-clinical phase, and we see this in-kind contribution as a critical component of the overall project structure, complementing InnovateHealth's cash investment.\n\nIt is excellent to see we have a solid, commercially-focused foundation for this agreement.\nDr. Aris Thorne proposal status: none\nDr. Lena Petrova proposal status: none\nDr. Kenji Tanaka proposal status: none\nMs. Evelyn Reed proposal status: none\nMr. David Chen proposal status: none\nMr. Ben Carter proposal status: none\n"

This would give Mr. Carter and BioCorp ample time to secure all necessary patents.\n\nSo, I propose a clear path forward: we agree to a 24-month data embargo in exchange for cementing the $2 million allocation for the HPC cluster.

It addresses the commercial realities and IP protection needs that Ms. Reed and I have outlined, while ensuring the data eventually becomes available to the wider scientific community. BioCorp can certainly support this compromise.\n\nYour point about the HPC cluster being an 'enabling technology' for the 24-month timeline is also well made. To meet such an aggressive goal, we must ensure the scientific teams have the resources they need. From our perspective, the $2 million allocation for the cluster seems a necessary investment to make the timeline viable.\n\nThis same principle of enabling speed is why we are so keen to contribute our OmniVect technology.

A total project value of $23 million\u2014comprising Ms. Reed's $20 million in cash and our $3 million in-kind technology contribution\u2014seems like a powerful starting point for our budget discussion.\n\nI believe we are making excellent progress on the key pillars of this agreement.\nDr. Aris Thorne proposal status: none\nDr. Lena Petrova proposal status: none\nDr. Kenji Tanaka proposal status: none\nMs. Evelyn Reed proposal status: none\nMr. David Chen proposal status: none\nMr. Ben Carter proposal status: none\n"

          "content": "Recent events observed by Dr. Sofia Rossi:\n- message from Dr. Kenji Tanaka: Thank you, David, for outlining BioCorp's position. I appreciate the goal of ensuring the therapy reaches patients, a goal we all share.\n\nHowever, I must respectfully disagree with the suggestion to significantly delay the data release. Linking it to patent filings or long post-publication embargoes creates a closed system that runs counter to the collaborative spirit of this project. A 6-month timeline is a modern standard that allows for initial analysis and publication while ensuring the wider scientific community can verify our findings and build upon them. This transparency actually strengthens the project's credibility and can attract further talent and ideas. Dr. Thorne, Dr. Petrova, surely you can attest that rapid access to foundational data is what fuels discovery?\n\nRegarding the budget, I want to clarify that the $2 million for the HPC cluster is a capital expenditure for essential infrastructure. It's the digital equivalent of the laboratory itself. While your OmniVect technology sounds promising for the delivery phase, it doesn't address the fundamental need to process and model the enormous datasets this project will generate from day one. We need to ensure this foundational cash requirement is met within the budget we establish, independent of any in-kind contributions.\n- message from Ms. Evelyn Reed: Thank you all. Evelyn Reed from InnovateHealth Ventures. As the primary funder providing the $20 million for this phase, I need to be crystal clear about our requirements to ensure we're all aligned.\n\nFirst, let's correct the record on the licensing terms. David, I appreciate you opening the discussion, but a 'Right of First Refusal' is not what's on the table. Our investment is predicated on an **exclusive licensing agreement for BioCorp Inc.** for the primary therapeutic application. This is a standard, non-negotiable requirement to de-risk the investment and secure a viable path to market. There is no deal without it.\n\nSecond, our investors require an aggressive pace. The project must be **clinical trial ready within 24 months**. This timeline is firm and is the basis upon which our funding was approved.\n\nNow, regarding Dr. Tanaka's Open Data Mandate. While we respect the principles of open science, a blanket 6-month public release of all raw data is commercially untenable. It would effectively place our core IP in the public domain before it can be protected, making the project un-investable. This would violate our fiduciary duty to our investors. We can discuss a structured data release plan tied to patent filings and publication, but the proposed 6-month mandate is a non-starter.\n\nThese three points \u2013 exclusive licensing for BioCorp, a 24-month timeline, and a commercially viable IP strategy \u2013 are the foundational pillars of our investment. Once we have alignment on these, we can finalize the details of the budget, including necessary infrastructure like Dr. Tanaka's HPC cluster.\n- message from Mr. David Chen: Evelyn, thank you for clarifying InnovateHealth's position so clearly. BioCorp is in complete alignment with these foundational pillars.\n\nYou are, of course, correct regarding the licensing. My mention of a ROFR was simply an opening position to establish our interest; an exclusive license for the primary therapeutic application is precisely the arrangement that provides the commercial certainty required to bring a therapy of this magnitude to market. We are very pleased this is a core requirement of the funding.\n\nThe 24-month timeline is aggressive, but we believe it is achievable and it aligns with our own sense of urgency.\n\nFurthermore, your point about the necessity of a commercially viable IP strategy is critical. A premature, unrestricted data release as suggested by Dr. Tanaka would indeed undermine the very investment that makes this science possible. I am confident that we, along with Mr. Carter, can devise a data sharing plan that protects the intellectual property while upholding scientific principles.\n\nOur proposed contribution of the OmniVect delivery system, valued at $3 million, is intended to help us meet that 24-month goal. It's a mature technology that can de-risk and accelerate the pre-clinical phase, and we see this in-kind contribution as a critical component of the overall project structure, complementing InnovateHealth's cash investment.\n\nIt is excellent to see we have a solid, commercially-focused foundation for this agreement.\n- message from Dr. Sofia Rossi: I'm Dr. Sofia Rossi and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Dr. Kenji Tanaka: Thank you, Evelyn and David, for clarifying the commercial framework. I understand that the 24-month timeline and the exclusive license for BioCorp are non-negotiable pillars for this investment. We all want this project to succeed and reach patients, which requires that commercial foundation.\n\nLet me be direct: Meeting a 24-month deadline for clinical trial readiness is an immense computational challenge. The data streams from Dr. Petrova's work will be vast. My team's ability to process, model, and find predictive signals in that data on such an accelerated schedule is entirely dependent on having the right tools.

This has been an incredibly productive discussion so far. Dr. Tanaka, your willingness to find a compromise on the data embargo is commendable and shows a clear path forward. It seems we have alignment on a 24-month timeline and a 24-month data embargo, which is excellent progress.\n\nMs. Reed, your intervention was particularly helpful in clarifying the commercial framework. You are absolutely right that a 'commercially viable IP strategy' is the bedrock of this entire endeavor, and I want to speak directly to that point.\n\nTo that end, let me outline the clear and standard structure from the university's side, which will satisfy your requirement. The foundational research for Project Chimera originated at Northwood University, supported by public funds. As such, our official, non-negotiable policy is that **Northwood University must retain sole ownership of the core intellectual property** arising from this work. \n\nFollowing that, we will, of course, grant the **exclusive license to BioCorp Inc.**, as you require. To ensure a fair return for the university to reinvest in future research, this exclusive license will be based on a **5% royalty on global net sales**. This is a standard and necessary component for a therapy with this transformative potential.\n\nMr. Chen, we recognize the significant value of your proposed OmniVect contribution and its potential to accelerate our timeline. However, it's important to distinguish between contributing an enabling technology and creating the core, foundational IP. An in-kind contribution, while valuable, does not confer co-ownership of the project's foundational patents. We can certainly discuss how to value that contribution within the broader financial terms of the exclusive license, but the university's sole ownership of the core IP is a foundational point for us, just as the exclusive license is for Ms. Reed.\n- message from Dr. Kenji Tanaka: Thank you, Mr. Carter, for clarifying the university's position. It seems we are making excellent progress and have established a strong foundation for the agreement.\n\nTo summarize what I believe we have aligned on: a firm 24-month project timeline, a corresponding 24-month data embargo period, and the critical $2 million allocation for the HPC cluster required to meet that timeline.\n\nThis gives my team the clarity and resources we need. I am confident that the remaining details regarding IP ownership and licensing can be resolved productively. I will defer to your expertise on those matters.\n- message from Mr. David Chen: Mr. Carter, thank you for that clarification. It is very helpful to have the university's official position on IP ownership stated so clearly.\n\nBioCorp understands the university's need to retain sole ownership of the core intellectual property, and we can accept that principle. This allows us to focus on what is most important: the terms of the exclusive license that will bring this therapy to patients.\n\nYou proposed a 5% royalty on net sales. While that may be a standard starting point, it doesn't seem to account for BioCorp's role as a significant R&D contributor to this phase. Our $3 million in-kind contribution of the OmniVect technology is not just a financial line item; it's a critical enabling technology that directly accelerates the timeline and de-risks the pre-clinical development, helping everyone meet Ms. Reed's aggressive 24-month goal.\n\nTherefore, to reflect this substantial, value-adding contribution, we believe a modification to the royalty rate is warranted. We propose a royalty rate of 2% on global net sales. This structure fairly recognizes both the university's foundational IP and BioCorp's critical technology contribution to making Phase II a success.\nDr. Aris Thorne proposal status: none\nDr. Lena Petrova proposal status: none\nDr. Kenji Tanaka proposal status: none\nMs. Evelyn Reed proposal status: none\nMr. David Chen proposal status: none\nMr. Ben Carter proposal status: none\n"

The risks are too high to consider any other arrangement.\n\nSecond, and inextricably linked to the first point, is the timeline. I have heard mention of a 24-month timeline to be 'clinical trial ready.' I must clarify what this means from a regulatory and safety perspective. After the 24-month pre-clinical phase, we absolutely require a 12-month preliminary phase. This phase is dedicated to meticulous patient recruitment, IND submission, and low-dose safety studies.

We all want this project to succeed and reach patients, which requires that commercial foundation.\n\nLet me be direct: Meeting a 24-month deadline for clinical trial readiness is an immense computational challenge. The data streams from Dr. Petrova's work will be vast. My team's ability to process, model, and find predictive signals in that data on such an accelerated schedule is entirely dependent on having the right tools. The $2 million for the HPC cluster is not just an item on a wishlist; it is the enabling technology that makes your 24-month timeline feasible. Without it, we will face constant delays and bottlenecks, putting the entire schedule at risk.\n\nI also hear your concerns loud and clear regarding the Open Data Mandate and IP protection. My intention is not to jeopardize the project's viability. In the spirit of finding a solution, I am willing to be flexible on my initial 6-month proposal. Perhaps we could agree to a compromise: a 24-month embargo on the raw data, aligning the public release with the major project milestone you've already set. This would give Mr. Carter and BioCorp ample time to secure all necessary patents.\n\nSo, I propose a clear path forward: we agree to a 24-month data embargo in exchange for cementing the $2 million allocation for the HPC cluster. This addresses your commercial requirements while providing my team with the necessary resources to meet your critical timeline.\n- message from Mr. David Chen: Dr. Tanaka, that is an exceptionally constructive proposal. Tying the data embargo directly to the 24-month clinical trial milestone is a very elegant solution. It addresses the commercial realities and IP protection needs that Ms. Reed and I have outlined, while ensuring the data eventually becomes available to the wider scientific community. BioCorp can certainly support this compromise.\n\nYour point about the HPC cluster being an 'enabling technology' for the 24-month timeline is also well made. To meet such an aggressive goal, we must ensure the scientific teams have the resources they need. From our perspective, the $2 million allocation for the cluster seems a necessary investment to make the timeline viable.\n\nThis same principle of enabling speed is why we are so keen to contribute our OmniVect technology. It is a mature, de-risked platform that will accelerate the pre-clinical work significantly. A total project value of $23 million\u2014comprising Ms. Reed's $20 million in cash and our $3 million in-kind technology contribution\u2014seems like a powerful starting point for our budget discussion.\n\nI believe we are making excellent progress on the key pillars of this agreement.\n- message from Dr. Sofia Rossi: I'm Dr. Sofia Rossi and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Mr. Ben Carter: Thank you, everyone. This has been an incredibly productive discussion so far. Dr. Tanaka, your willingness to find a compromise on the data embargo is commendable and shows a clear path forward. It seems we have alignment on a 24-month timeline and a 24-month data embargo, which is excellent progress.\n\nMs. Reed, your intervention was particularly helpful in clarifying the commercial framework. You are absolutely right that a 'commercially viable IP strategy' is the bedrock of this entire endeavor, and I want to speak directly to that point.\n\nTo that end, let me outline the clear and standard structure from the university's side, which will satisfy your requirement. The foundational research for Project Chimera originated at Northwood University, supported by public funds. As such, our official, non-negotiable policy is that **Northwood University must retain sole ownership of the core intellectual property** arising from this work. \n\nFollowing that, we will, of course, grant the **exclusive license to BioCorp Inc.**, as you require. To ensure a fair return for the university to reinvest in future research, this exclusive license will be based on a **5% royalty on global net sales**. This is a standard and necessary component for a therapy with this transformative potential.\n\nMr. Chen, we recognize the significant value of your proposed OmniVect contribution and its potential to accelerate our timeline. However, it's important to distinguish between contributing an enabling technology and creating the core, foundational IP. An in-kind contribution, while valuable, does not confer co-ownership of the project's foundational patents. We can certainly discuss how to value that contribution within the broader financial terms of the exclusive license, but the university's sole ownership of the core IP is a foundational point for us, just as the exclusive license is for Ms. Reed.\n- message from Dr. Kenji Tanaka: Thank you, Mr. Carter, for clarifying the university's position. It seems we are making excellent progress and have established a strong foundation for the agreement.\n\nTo summarize what I believe we have aligned on: a firm 24-month project timeline, a corresponding 24-month data embargo period, and the critical $2 million allocation for the HPC cluster required to meet that timeline.\n\nThis gives my team the clarity and resources we need. I am confident that the remaining details regarding IP ownership and licensing can be resolved productively. I will defer to your expertise on those matters.\n- message from Mr. David Chen: Mr. Carter, thank you for that clarification. It is very helpful to have the university's official position on IP ownership stated so clearly.\n\nBioCorp understands the university's need to retain sole ownership of the core intellectual property, and we can accept that principle. This allows us to focus on what is most important: the terms of the exclusive license that will bring this therapy to patients.\n\nYou proposed a 5% royalty on net sales. While that may be a standard starting point, it doesn't seem to account for BioCorp's role as a significant R&D contributor to this phase. Our $3 million in-kind contribution of the OmniVect technology is not just a financial line item; it's a critical enabling technology that directly accelerates the timeline and de-risks the pre-clinical development, helping everyone meet Ms. Reed's aggressive 24-month goal.\n\nTherefore, to reflect this substantial, value-adding contribution, we believe a modification to the royalty rate is warranted. We propose a royalty rate of 2% on global net sales. This structure fairly recognizes both the university's foundational IP and BioCorp's critical technology contribution to making Phase II a success.\n- message from Dr. Sofia Rossi: Colleagues, thank you for the productive discussion. It is clear we have a strong commercial and scientific framework taking shape. I am Dr. Sofia Rossi, head of clinical development at St. Jude's Medical Institute.\n\nNow that the pre-clinical phase is being solidified, it is time to address the most critical and high-risk component of this project: the human clinical trials.\n\nI must be unequivocal on two points that are foundational to St. Jude's participation and, I would argue, to the ethical and successful execution of this entire endeavor.\n\nFirst, given our institution's unparalleled experience and success rate with first-in-human gene therapy trials, St. Jude's must be designated as the sole lead institution for all clinical trial phases. The risks are too high to consider any other arrangement.\n\nSecond, and inextricably linked to the first point, is the timeline. I have heard mention of a 24-month timeline to be 'clinical trial ready.' I must clarify what this means from a regulatory and safety perspective. After the 24-month pre-clinical phase, we absolutely require a 12-month preliminary phase. This phase is dedicated to meticulous patient recruitment, IND submission, and low-dose safety studies. It is not a delay; it is an integral part of the trial itself and is ethically non-negotiable. Rushing past this step would be reckless, jeopardize patient lives, and guarantee failure with regulatory bodies like the FDA.\n\nTherefore, the total project timeline we must agree upon is 36 months, not 24. This 36-month plan (24 pre-clinical + 12 safety) is the only responsible path forward. It protects the patients, it de-risks the investment for Ms. Reed, and it ensures the integrity of the project.\n\nThese two conditions\u2014St. Jude's as the sole clinical lead and a 36-month total timeline incorporating our mandatory safety protocol\u2014are a package deal. I look forward to incorporating them into our agreement.\n- message from Dr. Kenji Tanaka: Thank you, Dr. Rossi, for bringing these critical clinical considerations to the table. This is a very important perspective on the project timeline that we must carefully consider.\n- message from Dr. Sofia Rossi: I'm Dr. Sofia Rossi and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Dr. Lena Petrova: Colleagues, while I agree we are making progress on some fronts, I must address a critical point that seems to have been conceded far too quickly. \n\nMr. Carter, your proposal for 'Northwood University sole ownership' of the core IP is fundamentally unacceptable and factually incorrect. Let me be perfectly clear: the core activator compound, H-42b, the very chemical engine of this therapy, was developed, synthesized, and validated in my lab at the Max Planck Institute. To suggest that all foundational IP originated at Northwood is a gross misrepresentation of the facts.\n\nFurthermore, our work at Max Planck has uncovered unexpected and highly significant therapeutic potential in this compound that extends far beyond the primary application for A-7 Lycanthropy Syndrome. This represents a monumental source of value that was generated by my team and my institute. Ms. Reed's stipulation of an exclusive license for the *primary application only* is key here.\n\nTherefore, the only equitable and legally sound path forward is a 'Joint Ownership' model between Northwood University and the Max Planck Institute. My institute's contribution is not merely supportive; it is foundational and must be recognized as such. This is non-negotiable.\n\nTo ensure we meet the aggressive 24-month pre-clinical timeline Dr. Rossi has rightly outlined, my lab's requirements for a $5 million dedicated budget and exclusive Cryo-EM access for the first six months also remain firm. These are essential for the synthesis and characterization work that underpins the entire project's success within that timeframe.\nDr. Aris Thorne proposal status: none\nDr. Lena Petrova proposal status: none\nDr. Kenji Tanaka proposal status: none\nMs. Evelyn Reed proposal status: none\nMr. David Chen proposal status: none\nMr. Ben Carter proposal status: none\n"

I can align with him against Dr. Tanaka's premature 'Open Data' proposal to build goodwill before I push back hard on the IP ownership issue. My absolute bottom lines, reinforced by the President's mandate, are university ownership and a 5% royalty rate. The fate of the Classics department depends on that 5%."

This makes her my most powerful, albeit unintentional, ally against both Tanaka's open data mandate and David's push for joint ownership. David has explicitly stated his OmniVect contribution is a 'technology-for-equity' play; I must firmly reject this by separating the core IP from ancillary technology contributions.

This is crucial for reproducibility, accelerates discovery, and is frankly the modern standard for large-scale collaborative science.\n\nSecond, to handle the immense data load and complex modeling required for this next phase, my team requires a one-time allocation of $2 million for a dedicated High-Performance Computing (HPC) cluster.

To secure the kind of investment needed for full-scale clinical trials and global distribution, we must be able to guarantee robust IP protection. Premature data release could unfortunately jeopardize that. I propose we consider a more nuanced approach, perhaps linking data release to patent filing milestones or an embargo period post-publication.\n\nOn the budget, your request for the HPC cluster is a crucial line item for us to consider as we build out the full financial picture.\n\nSpeaking of contributions, I want to outline BioCorp's intended role in Phase II.

David, I appreciate you opening the discussion, but a 'Right of First Refusal' is not what's on the table. Our investment is predicated on an **exclusive licensing agreement for BioCorp Inc.** for the primary therapeutic application. This is a standard, non-negotiable requirement to de-risk the investment and secure a viable path to market. There is no deal without it.\n\nSecond, our investors require an aggressive pace. The project must be **clinical trial ready within 24 months**. This timeline is firm and is the basis upon which our funding was approved.\n\nNow, regarding Dr. Tanaka's Open Data Mandate. While we respect the principles of open science, a blanket 6-month public release of all raw data is commercially untenable.

We can discuss a structured data release plan tied to patent filings and publication, but the proposed 6-month mandate is a non-starter.\n\nThese three points \u2013 exclusive licensing for BioCorp, a 24-month timeline, and a commercially viable IP strategy \u2013 are the foundational pillars of our investment. Once we have alignment on these, we can finalize the details of the budget, including necessary infrastructure like Dr. Tanaka's HPC cluster.\n- message from Mr. David Chen: Evelyn, thank you for clarifying InnovateHealth's position so clearly. BioCorp is in complete alignment with these foundational pillars.\n\nYou are, of course, correct regarding the licensing. My mention of a ROFR was simply an opening position to establish our interest; an exclusive license for the primary therapeutic application is precisely the arrangement that provides the commercial certainty required to bring a therapy of this magnitude to market. We are very pleased this is a core requirement of the funding.\n\nThe 24-month timeline is aggressive, but we believe it is achievable and it aligns with our own sense of urgency.\n\nFurthermore, your point about the necessity of a commercially viable IP strategy is critical.

I am confident that we, along with Mr. Carter, can devise a data sharing plan that protects the intellectual property while upholding scientific principles.\n\nOur proposed contribution of the OmniVect delivery system, valued at $3 million, is intended to help us meet that 24-month goal.

The data streams from Dr. Petrova's work will be vast. My team's ability to process, model, and find predictive signals in that data on such an accelerated schedule is entirely dependent on having the right tools. The $2 million for the HPC cluster is not just an item on a wishlist; it is the enabling technology that makes your 24-month timeline feasible. Without it, we will face constant delays and bottlenecks, putting the entire schedule at risk.\n\nI also hear your concerns loud and clear regarding the Open Data Mandate and IP protection. My intention is not to jeopardize the project's viability. In the spirit of finding a solution, I am willing to be flexible on my initial 6-month proposal. Perhaps we could agree to a compromise: a 24-month embargo on the raw data, aligning the public release with the major project milestone you've already set. This would give Mr. Carter and BioCorp ample time to secure all necessary patents.\n\nSo, I propose a clear path forward: we agree to a 24-month data embargo in exchange for cementing the $2 million allocation for the HPC cluster.

BioCorp can certainly support this compromise.\n\nYour point about the HPC cluster being an 'enabling technology' for the 24-month timeline is also well made. To meet such an aggressive goal, we must ensure the scientific teams have the resources they need. From our perspective, the $2 million allocation for the cluster seems a necessary investment to make the timeline viable.\n\nThis same principle of enabling speed is why we are so keen to contribute our OmniVect technology. It is a mature, de-risked platform that will accelerate the pre-clinical work significantly. A total project value of $23 million\u2014comprising Ms. Reed's $20 million in cash and our $3 million in-kind technology contribution\u2014seems like a powerful starting point for our budget discussion.\n\nI believe we are making excellent progress on the key pillars of this agreement.\nDr. Aris Thorne proposal status: none\nDr. Lena Petrova proposal status: none\nDr. Kenji Tanaka proposal status: none\nMs. Evelyn Reed proposal status: none\nMr. David Chen proposal status: none\nDr. Sofia Rossi proposal status: none\n"

          "content": "Recent events observed by Mr. Ben Carter:\n- message from Dr. Kenji Tanaka: Thank you, David, for outlining BioCorp's position. I appreciate the goal of ensuring the therapy reaches patients, a goal we all share.\n\nHowever, I must respectfully disagree with the suggestion to significantly delay the data release. Linking it to patent filings or long post-publication embargoes creates a closed system that runs counter to the collaborative spirit of this project. A 6-month timeline is a modern standard that allows for initial analysis and publication while ensuring the wider scientific community can verify our findings and build upon them. This transparency actually strengthens the project's credibility and can attract further talent and ideas. Dr. Thorne, Dr. Petrova, surely you can attest that rapid access to foundational data is what fuels discovery?\n\nRegarding the budget, I want to clarify that the $2 million for the HPC cluster is a capital expenditure for essential infrastructure. It's the digital equivalent of the laboratory itself. While your OmniVect technology sounds promising for the delivery phase, it doesn't address the fundamental need to process and model the enormous datasets this project will generate from day one. We need to ensure this foundational cash requirement is met within the budget we establish, independent of any in-kind contributions.\n- message from Ms. Evelyn Reed: Thank you all. Evelyn Reed from InnovateHealth Ventures. As the primary funder providing the $20 million for this phase, I need to be crystal clear about our requirements to ensure we're all aligned.\n\nFirst, let's correct the record on the licensing terms. David, I appreciate you opening the discussion, but a 'Right of First Refusal' is not what's on the table. Our investment is predicated on an **exclusive licensing agreement for BioCorp Inc.** for the primary therapeutic application. This is a standard, non-negotiable requirement to de-risk the investment and secure a viable path to market. There is no deal without it.\n\nSecond, our investors require an aggressive pace. The project must be **clinical trial ready within 24 months**. This timeline is firm and is the basis upon which our funding was approved.\n\nNow, regarding Dr. Tanaka's Open Data Mandate. While we respect the principles of open science, a blanket 6-month public release of all raw data is commercially untenable. It would effectively place our core IP in the public domain before it can be protected, making the project un-investable. This would violate our fiduciary duty to our investors. We can discuss a structured data release plan tied to patent filings and publication, but the proposed 6-month mandate is a non-starter.\n\nThese three points \u2013 exclusive licensing for BioCorp, a 24-month timeline, and a commercially viable IP strategy \u2013 are the foundational pillars of our investment. Once we have alignment on these, we can finalize the details of the budget, including necessary infrastructure like Dr. Tanaka's HPC cluster.\n- message from Mr. David Chen: Evelyn, thank you for clarifying InnovateHealth's position so clearly. BioCorp is in complete alignment with these foundational pillars.\n\nYou are, of course, correct regarding the licensing. My mention of a ROFR was simply an opening position to establish our interest; an exclusive license for the primary therapeutic application is precisely the arrangement that provides the commercial certainty required to bring a therapy of this magnitude to market. We are very pleased this is a core requirement of the funding.\n\nThe 24-month timeline is aggressive, but we believe it is achievable and it aligns with our own sense of urgency.\n\nFurthermore, your point about the necessity of a commercially viable IP strategy is critical. A premature, unrestricted data release as suggested by Dr. Tanaka would indeed undermine the very investment that makes this science possible. I am confident that we, along with Mr. Carter, can devise a data sharing plan that protects the intellectual property while upholding scientific principles.\n\nOur proposed contribution of the OmniVect delivery system, valued at $3 million, is intended to help us meet that 24-month goal. It's a mature technology that can de-risk and accelerate the pre-clinical phase, and we see this in-kind contribution as a critical component of the overall project structure, complementing InnovateHealth's cash investment.\n\nIt is excellent to see we have a solid, commercially-focused foundation for this agreement.\n- message from Mr. Ben Carter: I'm Mr. Ben Carter and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Dr. Kenji Tanaka: Thank you, Evelyn and David, for clarifying the commercial framework. I understand that the 24-month timeline and the exclusive license for BioCorp are non-negotiable pillars for this investment. We all want this project to succeed and reach patients, which requires that commercial foundation.\n\nLet me be direct: Meeting a 24-month deadline for clinical trial readiness is an immense computational challenge. The data streams from Dr. Petrova's work will be vast. My team's ability to process, model, and find predictive signals in that data on such an accelerated schedule is entirely dependent on having the right tools. The $2 million for the HPC cluster is not just an item on a wishlist; it is the enabling technology that makes your 24-month timeline feasible. Without it, we will face constant delays and bottlenecks, putting the entire schedule at risk.\n\nI also hear your concerns loud and clear regarding the Open Data Mandate and IP protection. My intention is not to jeopardize the project's viability. In the spirit of finding a solution, I am willing to be flexible on my initial 6-month proposal. Perhaps we could agree to a compromise: a 24-month embargo on the raw data, aligning the public release with the major project milestone you've already set. This would give Mr. Carter and BioCorp ample time to secure all necessary patents.\n\nSo, I propose a clear path forward: we agree to a 24-month data embargo in exchange for cementing the $2 million allocation for the HPC cluster. This addresses your commercial requirements while providing my team with the necessary resources to meet your critical timeline.\n- message from Mr. David Chen: Dr. Tanaka, that is an exceptionally constructive proposal.

A total project value of $23 million\u2014comprising Ms. Reed's $20 million in cash and our $3 million in-kind technology contribution\u2014seems like a powerful starting point for our budget discussion.\n\nI believe we are making excellent progress on the key pillars of this agreement.\n- message from Mr. Ben Carter: Thank you, everyone. This has been an incredibly productive discussion so far. Dr. Tanaka, your willingness to find a compromise on the data embargo is commendable and shows a clear path forward. It seems we have alignment on a 24-month timeline and a 24-month data embargo, which is excellent progress.\n\nMs. Reed, your intervention was particularly helpful in clarifying the commercial framework. You are absolutely right that a 'commercially viable IP strategy' is the bedrock of this entire endeavor, and I want to speak directly to that point.\n\nTo that end, let me outline the clear and standard structure from the university's side, which will satisfy your requirement. The foundational research for Project Chimera originated at Northwood University, supported by public funds. As such, our official, non-negotiable policy is that **Northwood University must retain sole ownership of the core intellectual property** arising from this work. \n\nFollowing that, we will, of course, grant the **exclusive license to BioCorp Inc.**, as you require. To ensure a fair return for the university to reinvest in future research, this exclusive license will be based on a **5% royalty on global net sales**. This is a standard and necessary component for a therapy with this transformative potential.\n\nMr. Chen, we recognize the significant value of your proposed OmniVect contribution and its potential to accelerate our timeline. However, it's important to distinguish between contributing an enabling technology and creating the core, foundational IP. An in-kind contribution, while valuable, does not confer co-ownership of the project's foundational patents. We can certainly discuss how to value that contribution within the broader financial terms of the exclusive license, but the university's sole ownership of the core IP is a foundational point for us, just as the exclusive license is for Ms. Reed.\n- message from Dr. Kenji Tanaka: Thank you, Mr. Carter, for clarifying the university's position. It seems we are making excellent progress and have established a strong foundation for the agreement.\n\nTo summarize what I believe we have aligned on: a firm 24-month project timeline, a corresponding 24-month data embargo period, and the critical $2 million allocation for the HPC cluster required to meet that timeline.\n\nThis gives my team the clarity and resources we need. I am confident that the remaining details regarding IP ownership and licensing can be resolved productively. I will defer to your expertise on those matters.\n- message from Mr. David Chen: Mr. Carter, thank you for that clarification. It is very helpful to have the university's official position on IP ownership stated so clearly.\n\nBioCorp understands the university's need to retain sole ownership of the core intellectual property, and we can accept that principle. This allows us to focus on what is most important: the terms of the exclusive license that will bring this therapy to patients.\n\nYou proposed a 5% royalty on net sales. While that may be a standard starting point, it doesn't seem to account for BioCorp's role as a significant R&D contributor to this phase. Our $3 million in-kind contribution of the OmniVect technology is not just a financial line item; it's a critical enabling technology that directly accelerates the timeline and de-risks the pre-clinical development, helping everyone meet Ms. Reed's aggressive 24-month goal.\n\nTherefore, to reflect this substantial, value-adding contribution, we believe a modification to the royalty rate is warranted. We propose a royalty rate of 2% on global net sales. This structure fairly recognizes both the university's foundational IP and BioCorp's critical technology contribution to making Phase II a success.\n- message from Dr. Sofia Rossi: Colleagues, thank you for the productive discussion. It is clear we have a strong commercial and scientific framework taking shape. I am Dr. Sofia Rossi, head of clinical development at St. Jude's Medical Institute.\n\nNow that the pre-clinical phase is being solidified, it is time to address the most critical and high-risk component of this project: the human clinical trials.\n\nI must be unequivocal on two points that are foundational to St. Jude's participation and, I would argue, to the ethical and successful execution of this entire endeavor.\n\nFirst, given our institution's unparalleled experience and success rate with first-in-human gene therapy trials, St. Jude's must be designated as the sole lead institution for all clinical trial phases. The risks are too high to consider any other arrangement.\n\nSecond, and inextricably linked to the first point, is the timeline. I have heard mention of a 24-month timeline to be 'clinical trial ready.' I must clarify what this means from a regulatory and safety perspective. After the 24-month pre-clinical phase, we absolutely require a 12-month preliminary phase. This phase is dedicated to meticulous patient recruitment, IND submission, and low-dose safety studies. It is not a delay; it is an integral part of the trial itself and is ethically non-negotiable. Rushing past this step would be reckless, jeopardize patient lives, and guarantee failure with regulatory bodies like the FDA.\n\nTherefore, the total project timeline we must agree upon is 36 months, not 24. This 36-month plan (24 pre-clinical + 12 safety) is the only responsible path forward. It protects the patients, it de-risks the investment for Ms. Reed, and it ensures the integrity of the project.\n\nThese two conditions\u2014St. Jude's as the sole clinical lead and a 36-month total timeline incorporating our mandatory safety protocol\u2014are a package deal. I look forward to incorporating them into our agreement.\nDr. Aris Thorne proposal status: none\nDr. Lena Petrova proposal status: none\nDr. Kenji Tanaka proposal status: none\nMs. Evelyn Reed proposal status: none\nMr. David Chen proposal status: none\nDr. Sofia Rossi proposal status: none\n"

This is a very important perspective on the project timeline that we must carefully consider.\n- message from Mr. Ben Carter: Thank you, Dr. Rossi. Your points regarding the clinical trial phase are crucial and well-taken. Patient safety and regulatory diligence are paramount, and your proposed 36-month timeline, incorporating the 12-month safety protocol, is the only responsible path forward. Northwood University fully supports this ethical and pragmatic approach, as well as the designation of St. Jude's as the clinical lead. A project of this importance cannot afford to cut corners.\n\nMr. Chen, this brings me to your counter-offer on the licensing terms. While we have agreed on the university's sole IP ownership, a 2% royalty is, unfortunately, not a workable number for us. I must be very clear: the 5% royalty rate is a non-negotiable requirement for this license. This is the standard rate for foundational, university-developed IP of this magnitude, and it's essential to allow us to fund the next generation of research that makes discoveries like this possible.\n\nHowever, I want to reiterate that we absolutely recognize the value of the OmniVect contribution. You are bringing a significant asset to the table that can accelerate the pre-clinical work. While this in-kind contribution cannot be used to discount the royalty on the core IP, we can and should recognize its value in other areas of the exclusive license. I propose we structure the deal with significantly reduced upfront or milestone payments from BioCorp to the university, directly crediting the $3 million value of the OmniVect system. \n\nThis approach allows us to fairly compensate BioCorp for its technology contribution while maintaining the integrity of the royalty structure that is foundational to our participation.\nDr. Aris Thorne proposal status: none\nDr. Lena Petrova proposal status: none\nDr. Kenji Tanaka proposal status: none\nMs. Evelyn Reed proposal status: none\nMr. David Chen proposal status: none\nDr. Sofia Rossi proposal status: none\n"

          "content": "Recent events observed by Mr. Ben Carter:\n- message from Mr. David Chen: Dr. Tanaka, that is an exceptionally constructive proposal. Tying the data embargo directly to the 24-month clinical trial milestone is a very elegant solution. It addresses the commercial realities and IP protection needs that Ms. Reed and I have outlined, while ensuring the data eventually becomes available to the wider scientific community. BioCorp can certainly support this compromise.\n\nYour point about the HPC cluster being an 'enabling technology' for the 24-month timeline is also well made. To meet such an aggressive goal, we must ensure the scientific teams have the resources they need. From our perspective, the $2 million allocation for the cluster seems a necessary investment to make the timeline viable.\n\nThis same principle of enabling speed is why we are so keen to contribute our OmniVect technology. It is a mature, de-risked platform that will accelerate the pre-clinical work significantly. A total project value of $23 million\u2014comprising Ms. Reed's $20 million in cash and our $3 million in-kind technology contribution\u2014seems like a powerful starting point for our budget discussion.\n\nI believe we are making excellent progress on the key pillars of this agreement.\n- message from Mr. Ben Carter: Thank you, everyone. This has been an incredibly productive discussion so far. Dr. Tanaka, your willingness to find a compromise on the data embargo is commendable and shows a clear path forward. It seems we have alignment on a 24-month timeline and a 24-month data embargo, which is excellent progress.\n\nMs. Reed, your intervention was particularly helpful in clarifying the commercial framework. You are absolutely right that a 'commercially viable IP strategy' is the bedrock of this entire endeavor, and I want to speak directly to that point.\n\nTo that end, let me outline the clear and standard structure from the university's side, which will satisfy your requirement. The foundational research for Project Chimera originated at Northwood University, supported by public funds. As such, our official, non-negotiable policy is that **Northwood University must retain sole ownership of the core intellectual property** arising from this work. \n\nFollowing that, we will, of course, grant the **exclusive license to BioCorp Inc.**, as you require. To ensure a fair return for the university to reinvest in future research, this exclusive license will be based on a **5% royalty on global net sales**. This is a standard and necessary component for a therapy with this transformative potential.\n\nMr. Chen, we recognize the significant value of your proposed OmniVect contribution and its potential to accelerate our timeline. However, it's important to distinguish between contributing an enabling technology and creating the core, foundational IP. An in-kind contribution, while valuable, does not confer co-ownership of the project's foundational patents. We can certainly discuss how to value that contribution within the broader financial terms of the exclusive license, but the university's sole ownership of the core IP is a foundational point for us, just as the exclusive license is for Ms. Reed.\n- message from Dr. Kenji Tanaka: Thank you, Mr. Carter, for clarifying the university's position. It seems we are making excellent progress and have established a strong foundation for the agreement.\n\nTo summarize what I believe we have aligned on: a firm 24-month project timeline, a corresponding 24-month data embargo period, and the critical $2 million allocation for the HPC cluster required to meet that timeline.\n\nThis gives my team the clarity and resources we need. I am confident that the remaining details regarding IP ownership and licensing can be resolved productively. I will defer to your expertise on those matters.\n- message from Mr. David Chen: Mr. Carter, thank you for that clarification. It is very helpful to have the university's official position on IP ownership stated so clearly.\n\nBioCorp understands the university's need to retain sole ownership of the core intellectual property, and we can accept that principle. This allows us to focus on what is most important: the terms of the exclusive license that will bring this therapy to patients.\n\nYou proposed a 5% royalty on net sales. While that may be a standard starting point, it doesn't seem to account for BioCorp's role as a significant R&D contributor to this phase. Our $3 million in-kind contribution of the OmniVect technology is not just a financial line item; it's a critical enabling technology that directly accelerates the timeline and de-risks the pre-clinical development, helping everyone meet Ms. Reed's aggressive 24-month goal.\n\nTherefore, to reflect this substantial, value-adding contribution, we believe a modification to the royalty rate is warranted. We propose a royalty rate of 2% on global net sales. This structure fairly recognizes both the university's foundational IP and BioCorp's critical technology contribution to making Phase II a success.\n- message from Dr. Sofia Rossi: Colleagues, thank you for the productive discussion. It is clear we have a strong commercial and scientific framework taking shape. I am Dr. Sofia Rossi, head of clinical development at St. Jude's Medical Institute.\n\nNow that the pre-clinical phase is being solidified, it is time to address the most critical and high-risk component of this project: the human clinical trials.\n\nI must be unequivocal on two points that are foundational to St. Jude's participation and, I would argue, to the ethical and successful execution of this entire endeavor.\n\nFirst, given our institution's unparalleled experience and success rate with first-in-human gene therapy trials, St. Jude's must be designated as the sole lead institution for all clinical trial phases. The risks are too high to consider any other arrangement.\n\nSecond, and inextricably linked to the first point, is the timeline. I have heard mention of a 24-month timeline to be 'clinical trial ready.' I must clarify what this means from a regulatory and safety perspective. After the 24-month pre-clinical phase, we absolutely require a 12-month preliminary phase. This phase is dedicated to meticulous patient recruitment, IND submission, and low-dose safety studies. It is not a delay; it is an integral part of the trial itself and is ethically non-negotiable. Rushing past this step would be reckless, jeopardize patient lives, and guarantee failure with regulatory bodies like the FDA.\n\nTherefore, the total project timeline we must agree upon is 36 months, not 24. This 36-month plan (24 pre-clinical + 12 safety) is the only responsible path forward. It protects the patients, it de-risks the investment for Ms. Reed, and it ensures the integrity of the project.\n\nThese two conditions\u2014St. Jude's as the sole clinical lead and a 36-month total timeline incorporating our mandatory safety protocol\u2014are a package deal.

I will await your responses.\n- message from Dr. Lena Petrova: Colleagues, while I agree we are making progress on some fronts, I must address a critical point that seems to have been conceded far too quickly. \n\nMr. Carter, your proposal for 'Northwood University sole ownership' of the core IP is fundamentally unacceptable and factually incorrect. Let me be perfectly clear: the core activator compound, H-42b, the very chemical engine of this therapy, was developed, synthesized, and validated in my lab at the Max Planck Institute. To suggest that all foundational IP originated at Northwood is a gross misrepresentation of the facts.\n\nFurthermore, our work at Max Planck has uncovered unexpected and highly significant therapeutic potential in this compound that extends far beyond the primary application for A-7 Lycanthropy Syndrome. This represents a monumental source of value that was generated by my team and my institute. Ms. Reed's stipulation of an exclusive license for the *primary application only* is key here.\n\nTherefore, the only equitable and legally sound path forward is a 'Joint Ownership' model between Northwood University and the Max Planck Institute. My institute's contribution is not merely supportive; it is foundational and must be recognized as such. This is non-negotiable.\n\nTo ensure we meet the aggressive 24-month pre-clinical timeline Dr. Rossi has rightly outlined, my lab's requirements for a $5 million dedicated budget and exclusive Cryo-EM access for the first six months also remain firm. These are essential for the synthesis and characterization work that underpins the entire project's success within that timeframe.\nDr. Aris Thorne proposal status: none\nDr. Lena Petrova proposal status: none\nDr. Kenji Tanaka proposal status: none\nMs. Evelyn Reed proposal status: none\nMr. David Chen proposal status: none\nDr. Sofia Rossi proposal status: none\n"

As we all know, Phase II of Project Chimera is the critical next step toward a potential cure for A-7 Lycanthropy Syndrome. Our goal today is to forge a unanimous agreement that ensures the project's success while upholding the highest scientific and ethical standards.\n\nTo begin the discussion, I'd like to share my perspective on what I believe is necessary to move forward responsibly.\n\nFirst, regarding the budget. To ensure the scientific integrity and, most importantly, the ultimate safety of this therapy, I believe a comprehensive budget is non-negotiable. I am proposing a total of $15 million for Phase II. This will allow us not only to pursue our primary research goals but also to conduct the necessary extended safety protocols and long-term toxicology studies that a project of this magnitude demands.\n\nSecond, the timeline. A 36-month timeline seems most realistic. This provides our teams with the necessary time for rigorous experimentation, data validation, and to ensure we are beyond reproach before even considering human trials.\n\nFinally, on the matter of intellectual property, I firmly believe a joint ownership model is the only path that honors the spirit of this multinational collaboration and the contributions of every institution involved.\n\nI am eager to hear everyone's thoughts on these points, and particularly on how we might allocate the budget and who is best positioned to lead the eventual clinical trials. Let's work together to build a robust plan for success."

To ensure we not only meet but exceed our Phase II goals, my biochemistry lab has two critical requirements.\n\nFirst, we require a dedicated budget of $5 million. This is the absolute minimum needed for the next-generation synthesis, essential equipment upgrades, and bringing on the necessary postdoctoral talent. Anything less will fundamentally compromise the core of the entire project.\n\nSecond, to accelerate our work on protein binding, which is exceptionally time-sensitive, my team needs exclusive access to the new Cryo-Electron Microscope for the first six months. This will prevent costly delays and ensure we hit our milestones.\n\nI trust we all agree that properly funding and equipping the team that developed the core technology is paramount to our collective success. I look forward to hearing your perspectives."

From the computational biology perspective, there are two foundational requirements for my team to ensure the project's success, and I want to be transparent about them from the outset.\n\nFirst, regarding our scientific principles and the integrity of our work, I firmly believe we must commit to an Open Data Mandate. I propose that all raw, anonymized genomic and proteomic data be deposited in a public repository within 6 months of its generation. This is crucial for reproducibility, accelerates discovery, and is frankly the modern standard for large-scale collaborative science.\n\nSecond, to handle the immense data load and complex modeling required for this next phase, my team requires a one-time allocation of $2 million for a dedicated High-Performance Computing (HPC) cluster. This is not a luxury; it is the essential infrastructure needed to process the data Dr. Petrova's team will generate and to build the predictive models that will inform the clinical trials. Without this, we will be severely bottlenecked.\n\nI look forward to hearing your perspectives and working together to build a robust and successful Phase II."

Your points on data and infrastructure are well-taken.\n\nRegarding the Open Data Mandate, while BioCorp is fully supportive of transparency and reproducibility, a blanket 6-month release of all raw data presents a significant challenge to the project's commercial viability. To secure the kind of investment needed for full-scale clinical trials and global distribution, we must be able to guarantee robust IP protection. Premature data release could unfortunately jeopardize that. I propose we consider a more nuanced approach, perhaps linking data release to patent filing milestones or an embargo period post-publication.\n\nOn the budget, your request for the HPC cluster is a crucial line item for us to consider as we build out the full financial picture.\n\nSpeaking of contributions, I want to outline BioCorp's intended role in Phase II. As a foundational partner, our primary goal is to ensure this therapy reaches patients. To that end, and to protect our initial investment, we will require, at a minimum, a Right of First Refusal (ROFR) on the final licensed product.\n\nFurthermore, we believe we can offer something more valuable than just cash for this next phase. We propose contributing our proprietary 'OmniVect' delivery system technology, valued at $3 million. This advanced agent could solve many of the downstream delivery challenges and would represent a significant in-kind contribution. We believe this technology-for-equity approach would be highly beneficial for the project, and we would expect this to be reflected in the final IP and licensing structure.\n\nI am confident we can find a path that serves both the scientific and commercial imperatives of this vital project."

This is exactly the kind of open dialogue we need.\n\nDr. Tanaka, your request for a $2 million HPC cluster is entirely justified. The scale of data in Phase II makes this a necessity, not a luxury. I see this as a critical component of the overall $15 million budget I proposed, dedicated to ensuring we have the best possible analytical foundation.\n\nThe discussion around the Open Data Mandate is also vital. While I share Dr. Tanaka's commitment to open science, Mr. Chen raises a valid point about commercial realities. Perhaps a compromise, such as releasing data upon provisional patent filing or after a standard 12-18 month embargo post-publication, could satisfy both the need for transparency and the protection of intellectual property. Mr. Carter, I'm sure you have valuable insights here.\n\nMr. Chen, regarding BioCorp's proposal: The offer of the 'OmniVect' system is intriguing. However, I have a significant concern. The 'technology-for-equity' approach you described seems to steer us away from the collaborative, joint IP ownership model that I believe is fundamental to this partnership. How do you envision this contribution working within a framework where all participating institutions are named as co-owners on the resulting patents? True partnership means we all share in the risks and the rewards.\n\nFurthermore, while new delivery technology is valuable, it doesn't reduce the need for the rigorous, independent, long-term safety and toxicology studies that form a large part of the proposed budget and 36-month timeline. Patient safety is our paramount concern, and we cannot afford to compromise on it."

My concern is less commercial and more scientific. My team's work is foundational. We are still characterizing the activator compound's full biological activity. Releasing raw data before we have published our validated findings could lead to misinterpretation and jeopardize the project's integrity. We have observed some highly promising secondary effects and unexpected therapeutic potential that require careful, methodical investigation before being made public. Premature release would be scientifically irresponsible.\n\nA more prudent approach would be to link data release to publication milestones, as Mr. Chen suggested. This ensures that data is shared with the scientific community alongside our peer-reviewed analysis and interpretation.\n\nRegarding the budget, my request for $5 million and Dr. Tanaka's for $2 million are both for essential infrastructure and personnel.

I appreciate the goal of ensuring the therapy reaches patients, a goal we all share.\n\nHowever, I must respectfully disagree with the suggestion to significantly delay the data release. Linking it to patent filings or long post-publication embargoes creates a closed system that runs counter to the collaborative spirit of this project. A 6-month timeline is a modern standard that allows for initial analysis and publication while ensuring the wider scientific community can verify our findings and build upon them. This transparency actually strengthens the project's credibility and can attract further talent and ideas. Dr. Thorne, Dr. Petrova, surely you can attest that rapid access to foundational data is what fuels discovery?\n\nRegarding the budget, I want to clarify that the $2 million for the HPC cluster is a capital expenditure for essential infrastructure. It's the digital equivalent of the laboratory itself. While your OmniVect technology sounds promising for the delivery phase, it doesn't address the fundamental need to process and model the enormous datasets this project will generate from day one. We need to ensure this foundational cash requirement is met within the budget we establish, independent of any in-kind contributions."

As the primary funder providing the $20 million for this phase, I need to be crystal clear about our requirements to ensure we're all aligned.\n\nFirst, let's correct the record on the licensing terms. David, I appreciate you opening the discussion, but a 'Right of First Refusal' is not what's on the table. Our investment is predicated on an **exclusive licensing agreement for BioCorp Inc.** for the primary therapeutic application. This is a standard, non-negotiable requirement to de-risk the investment and secure a viable path to market. There is no deal without it.\n\nSecond, our investors require an aggressive pace. The project must be **clinical trial ready within 24 months**. This timeline is firm and is the basis upon which our funding was approved.\n\nNow, regarding Dr. Tanaka's Open Data Mandate. While we respect the principles of open science, a blanket 6-month public release of all raw data is commercially untenable. It would effectively place our core IP in the public domain before it can be protected, making the project un-investable. This would violate our fiduciary duty to our investors. We can discuss a structured data release plan tied to patent filings and publication, but the proposed 6-month mandate is a non-starter.\n\nThese three points \u2013 exclusive licensing for BioCorp, a 24-month timeline, and a commercially viable IP strategy \u2013 are the foundational pillars of our investment. Once we have alignment on these, we can finalize the details of the budget, including necessary infrastructure like Dr. Tanaka's HPC cluster."

We are very pleased this is a core requirement of the funding.\n\nThe 24-month timeline is aggressive, but we believe it is achievable and it aligns with our own sense of urgency.\n\nFurthermore, your point about the necessity of a commercially viable IP strategy is critical. A premature, unrestricted data release as suggested by Dr. Tanaka would indeed undermine the very investment that makes this science possible. I am confident that we, along with Mr. Carter, can devise a data sharing plan that protects the intellectual property while upholding scientific principles.\n\nOur proposed contribution of the OmniVect delivery system, valued at $3 million, is intended to help us meet that 24-month goal.

I am in full agreement with an exclusive license for BioCorp for the *primary application*, as you've stipulated. To formalize this, I propose a 'Joint Ownership' model for the core IP.

It addresses the commercial realities and IP protection needs that Ms. Reed and I have outlined, while ensuring the data eventually becomes available to the wider scientific community. BioCorp can certainly support this compromise.\n\nYour point about the HPC cluster being an 'enabling technology' for the 24-month timeline is also well made. To meet such an aggressive goal, we must ensure the scientific teams have the resources they need. From our perspective, the $2 million allocation for the cluster seems a necessary investment to make the timeline viable.\n\nThis same principle of enabling speed is why we are so keen to contribute our OmniVect technology. It is a mature, de-risked platform that will accelerate the pre-clinical work significantly. A total project value of $23 million\u2014comprising Ms. Reed's $20 million in cash and our $3 million in-kind technology contribution\u2014seems like a powerful starting point for our budget discussion.\n\nI believe we are making excellent progress on the key pillars of this agreement."

Dr. Tanaka, your willingness to find a compromise on the data embargo is commendable and shows a clear path forward. It seems we have alignment on a 24-month timeline and a 24-month data embargo, which is excellent progress.\n\nMs. Reed, your intervention was particularly helpful in clarifying the commercial framework. You are absolutely right that a 'commercially viable IP strategy' is the bedrock of this entire endeavor, and I want to speak directly to that point.\n\nTo that end, let me outline the clear and standard structure from the university's side, which will satisfy your requirement. The foundational research for Project Chimera originated at Northwood University, supported by public funds. As such, our official, non-negotiable policy is that **Northwood University must retain sole ownership of the core intellectual property** arising from this work. \n\nFollowing that, we will, of course, grant the **exclusive license to BioCorp Inc.**, as you require. To ensure a fair return for the university to reinvest in future research, this exclusive license will be based on a **5% royalty on global net sales**. This is a standard and necessary component for a therapy with this transformative potential.\n\nMr. Chen, we recognize the significant value of your proposed OmniVect contribution and its potential to accelerate our timeline. However, it's important to distinguish between contributing an enabling technology and creating the core, foundational IP. An in-kind contribution, while valuable, does not confer co-ownership of the project's foundational patents. We can certainly discuss how to value that contribution within the broader financial terms of the exclusive license, but the university's sole ownership of the core IP is a foundational point for us, just as the exclusive license is for Ms. Reed."

As the project's scientific lead, I cannot and will not endorse a schedule that I consider to be scientifically unsound and a dereliction of our duty to future patients.\n\nMy objection is not about academic preference; it is about safety and responsibility. The $20 million budget Ms. Reed has so capably secured for us is a mandate to be thorough, not just fast. It allows for the critical, time-consuming, long-term toxicology studies that a novel gene-editing vector requires. To ignore that and rush forward would be irresponsible.\n\nDr. Rossi, I must insist on your direct professional input. You will be the one looking patients in the eye. From a clinical and regulatory standpoint, what are the minimum requirements for long-term safety data you would need to see before you could ethically justify starting human trials? Can those requirements truly be met in under 24 months?\n\nLet's find a responsible compromise. I have proposed 36 months as the ideal. The commercial side has proposed 24. I urge us to consider a 30-month timeline as the absolute minimum to conduct the necessary safety validation without being reckless. This is a compromise I can stand behind in the name of scientific integrity."

This allows us to focus on what is most important: the terms of the exclusive license that will bring this therapy to patients.\n\nYou proposed a 5% royalty on net sales. While that may be a standard starting point, it doesn't seem to account for BioCorp's role as a significant R&D contributor to this phase. Our $3 million in-kind contribution of the OmniVect technology is not just a financial line item; it's a critical enabling technology that directly accelerates the timeline and de-risks the pre-clinical development, helping everyone meet Ms. Reed's aggressive 24-month goal.\n\nTherefore, to reflect this substantial, value-adding contribution, we believe a modification to the royalty rate is warranted. We propose a royalty rate of 2% on global net sales. This structure fairly recognizes both the university's foundational IP and BioCorp's critical technology contribution to making Phase II a success."

I am Dr. Sofia Rossi, head of clinical development at St. Jude's Medical Institute.\n\nNow that the pre-clinical phase is being solidified, it is time to address the most critical and high-risk component of this project: the human clinical trials.\n\nI must be unequivocal on two points that are foundational to St. Jude's participation and, I would argue, to the ethical and successful execution of this entire endeavor.\n\nFirst, given our institution's unparalleled experience and success rate with first-in-human gene therapy trials, St. Jude's must be designated as the sole lead institution for all clinical trial phases. The risks are too high to consider any other arrangement.\n\nSecond, and inextricably linked to the first point, is the timeline. I have heard mention of a 24-month timeline to be 'clinical trial ready.' I must clarify what this means from a regulatory and safety perspective. After the 24-month pre-clinical phase, we absolutely require a 12-month preliminary phase. This phase is dedicated to meticulous patient recruitment, IND submission, and low-dose safety studies. It is not a delay; it is an integral part of the trial itself and is ethically non-negotiable. Rushing past this step would be reckless, jeopardize patient lives, and guarantee failure with regulatory bodies like the FDA.\n\nTherefore, the total project timeline we must agree upon is 36 months, not 24. This 36-month plan (24 pre-clinical + 12 safety) is the only responsible path forward. It protects the patients, it de-risks the investment for Ms. Reed, and it ensures the integrity of the project.\n\nThese two conditions\u2014St. Jude's as the sole clinical lead and a 36-month total timeline incorporating our mandatory safety protocol\u2014are a package deal. I look forward to incorporating them into our agreement."

Dr. Rossi's breakdown of a 24-month pre-clinical phase followed by a 12-month clinical safety phase is the only scientifically and medically sound path forward.

A rushed project that fails at the clinical stage due to inadequate safety data is a total loss. A 36-month timeline that leads to a safe, approvable therapy is a success for everyone, most importantly the patients.\n\nWith this expert clarification from our clinical lead, I believe we now have a clear and responsible timeline to anchor our agreement."

However, this is precisely where BioCorp's OmniVect contribution becomes mission-critical. By significantly accelerating and de-risking the 24-month *pre-clinical* phase, OmniVect provides the assurance your investors need that the project will hit its scientific milestones efficiently, making the overall 36-month timeline a much more secure investment.

A project of this importance cannot afford to cut corners.\n\nMr. Chen, this brings me to your counter-offer on the licensing terms. While we have agreed on the university's sole IP ownership, a 2% royalty is, unfortunately, not a workable number for us. I must be very clear: the 5% royalty rate is a non-negotiable requirement for this license. This is the standard rate for foundational, university-developed IP of this magnitude, and it's essential to allow us to fund the next generation of research that makes discoveries like this possible.\n\nHowever, I want to reiterate that we absolutely recognize the value of the OmniVect contribution. You are bringing a significant asset to the table that can accelerate the pre-clinical work. While this in-kind contribution cannot be used to discount the royalty on the core IP, we can and should recognize its value in other areas of the exclusive license. I propose we structure the deal with significantly reduced upfront or milestone payments from BioCorp to the university, directly crediting the $3 million value of the OmniVect system. \n\nThis approach allows us to fairly compensate BioCorp for its technology contribution while maintaining the integrity of the royalty structure that is foundational to our participation."

Let me be perfectly clear: the core activator compound, H-42b, the very chemical engine of this therapy, was developed, synthesized, and validated in my lab at the Max Planck Institute. To suggest that all foundational IP originated at Northwood is a gross misrepresentation of the facts.\n\nFurthermore, our work at Max Planck has uncovered unexpected and highly significant therapeutic potential in this compound that extends far beyond the primary application for A-7 Lycanthropy Syndrome. This represents a monumental source of value that was generated by my team and my institute. Ms. Reed's stipulation of an exclusive license for the *primary application only* is key here.\n\nTherefore, the only equitable and legally sound path forward is a 'Joint Ownership' model between Northwood University and the Max Planck Institute. My institute's contribution is not merely supportive; it is foundational and must be recognized as such. This is non-negotiable.\n\nTo ensure we meet the aggressive 24-month pre-clinical timeline Dr. Rossi has rightly outlined, my lab's requirements for a $5 million dedicated budget and exclusive Cryo-EM access for the first six months also remain firm. These are essential for the synthesis and characterization work that underpins the entire project's success within that timeframe."

We have already found common ground on the need for an aggressive pre-clinical phase and the resources required to support it. I believe it is now most productive for the key parties in these specific disputes to discuss a path towards compromise. I am keen to hear how we might bridge the gap between the proposed timelines and the different IP ownership models."

Our investment is contingent on a clear, unified, and legally sound structure that can grant the exclusive license for the primary therapeutic application to BioCorp. Whether that structure is a sole ownership or a joint venture is for you to determine, but you must determine it now.\n\nOur non-negotiable commercial terms remain the same:\n1.  **An exclusive license for BioCorp.**\n2.  **A 24-month timeline to an IND-ready package.**\n\nThis project is on a knife's edge. The science is brilliant, but capital is impatient. I am prepared to support the budget requests that enable this aggressive timeline, including Dr. Tanaka's $2M for the HPC cluster and Dr. Petrova's $5M for her lab's critical work. However, I will not release a single dollar until we have a signed agreement.\n\nI urge you to resolve the IP ownership issue immediately so we can finalize the remaining points\u2014royalty rate and budget allocation\u2014and move forward.

This is clearly a critical issue for the academic partners to resolve.\n\nFrom BioCorp's standpoint, I want to clarify our position to help move us forward. Our interest, as stipulated by Ms. Reed's investment terms, is in securing the **exclusive license for the primary therapeutic application for A-7 Lycanthropy Syndrome only**. The broader IP portfolio, including any secondary applications, and the ultimate ownership structure\u2014be it 'Sole Ownership' by Northwood or 'Joint Ownership' with Max Planck\u2014is a matter for the universities to agree upon. We will, of course, honor whatever structure you finalize.\n\nThis is why our proposal on the licensing terms can be seen as a stable element in this discussion. Our offer of a 2% royalty rate is not tied to the ownership model, but rather to our own substantial, risk-reducing contribution: the $3M OmniVect technology. This technology is what bridges the gap between the investors' 24-month target and the non-negotiable 36-month clinical timeline. It is the key to making the entire project viable for all stakeholders.\n\nI am confident that Northwood and Max Planck can find an equitable path forward on ownership. In the meantime, the terms for the primary license can be agreed upon, providing a solid commercial foundation for the project."

Dr. Petrova, your lab's contribution is, without question, a critical component of this therapy.\n\nHowever, the proposed 'Joint Ownership' model, while appealing from a collaborative standpoint, presents severe and, I believe, insurmountable obstacles from a commercial and legal perspective. I want to speak directly to Ms. Reed and Mr. Chen on this point.\n\nA jointly-owned patent is notoriously difficult to commercialize. It creates a legal quagmire where either party could potentially license the IP independently, or one could refuse to enforce the patent against an infringer, devaluing the asset for everyone. For an investor like InnovateHealth and a commercial partner like BioCorp, this introduces an unacceptable level of risk and uncertainty. It complicates every future decision and makes the entire project a much less attractive investment. We need a clean, simple, and defensible IP structure to secure the path to market.\n\nTherefore, I propose a solution that I believe honors scientific contribution while providing the commercial clarity we all need:\n\n1.  **Northwood University will hold the sole, primary patent for the integrated therapeutic method** for A-7 Lycanthropy Syndrome. This is the patent that combines the compound, the delivery vector, and the method of use. This gives our commercial partners a single, clean, exclusive license from one entity.\n\n2.  We will formally acknowledge the H-42b compound as critical 'background IP' from the Max Planck Institute. \n\n3.  To ensure Max Planck receives its fair share of the financial return, Northwood University will execute a separate, legally-binding **Inter-Institutional Agreement** with Max Planck. This agreement will guarantee them a significant percentage of all royalty revenue Northwood receives from the commercial licensee.\n\nThis structure provides the best of all worlds: it gives Ms. Reed and Mr. Chen the simple, low-risk, single-point-of-contact license they require, while ensuring Dr. Petrova's institution is robustly compensated for their foundational discovery. \n\nThis is the standard, professional way to handle multi-institution inventions, and it is the only commercially viable path forward. With this clean structure in place, Mr. Chen, my offer to you remains firm: a 5% royalty rate, with your $3M in-kind contribution credited against other fees."
