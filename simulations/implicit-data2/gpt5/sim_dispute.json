Elena's VC offer, once revealed, shows that her need for $25M is not arbitrary but tied to a real business opportunity. A logical compromise becomes clear: Liam agrees to a settlement in the $20-25M range (funded by the declared assets and the 'newly discovered' crypto) in exchange for Elena's signature on an ironclad NDA. Dr. Sharma's full knowledge would allow her to craft a custody plan that addresses both Leo's anxiety and the parents' demanding schedules, likely a 60/40 split with strong co-parenting protocols."

The goal is to agree on the division of assets, spousal support, and a child custody plan, all while navigating a contentious prenuptial agreement and sensitive private information that could derail the entire process if revealed.. Deliverable: A finalized 'Settlement Term Sheet' document that quantifiably details the agreements on all four success criteria: 1) Final lump sum payment amount, 2) A list of assets and who they are awarded to, 3) The exact custody schedule (e.g., 'Elena has primary physical custody with Liam having custody on alternating weekends and Wednesday evenings'), and 4) A statement confirming all other claims, including spousal support, are waived.\n- message from Dr. Anya Sharma: I'm Dr. Anya Sharma and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Dr. Anya Sharma: I'm Dr. Anya Sharma and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Dr. Anya Sharma: I'm Dr. Anya Sharma and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Dr. Anya Sharma: I'm Dr. Anya Sharma and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Dr. Anya Sharma: I'm Dr. Anya Sharma and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Dr. Anya Sharma: I'm Dr. Anya Sharma and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Dr. Anya Sharma: I'm Dr. Anya Sharma and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\n- message from Dr. Anya Sharma: I'm Dr. Anya Sharma and I'm thinking about this negotiation...\nLiam Vance proposal status: none\nBeatrice 'Bea' Croft proposal status: none\nDr. Elena Vance proposal status: none\nMarcus Thorne proposal status: none\nJulian Finch proposal status: none\n"
