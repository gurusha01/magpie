Marcus's (Stalwart CEO) need for a smooth succession can be traded for Aris's (InnovateNext CEO) desire for a high-status role that is not the top job. Kenji's (CTO) need for a large budget to fix the tech debt can be justified to David (Chairman) as a necessary investment to secure the deal's long-term value and fend off the raider.
