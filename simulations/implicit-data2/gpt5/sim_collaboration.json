If the timeline is purely commercially driven (e.g., 'get to market in 4 years no matter what'), he will be very unhappy. A milestone-driven timeline where he has advisory control is acceptable. A timeline where he has final say on scientific safety protocols would make him very happy. Utility: +2 for full scientific control over milestones, 0 for advisory role, -2 for a rigid, commercially-driven timeline.",

The therapy was highly effective for the other 95%. He has not yet replicated these findings and fears revealing them prematurely could kill the entire project and tarnish his reputation. He can only share vague concerns about 'needing to investigate specific patient subpopulations' without revealing the data.

He will secretly push for a trial design that includes robust genetic screening and monitoring for neuroinflammation, even if it adds cost and time. If a deal is signed that includes a mandatory, funded screening protocol for this specific marker, his utility is +2.

He argues BioGen's proprietary delivery platform is essential for the project's success and warrants an equal stake. Utility: +2 for a >=40% stake in a JV, +1 for a 20-39% stake, -1 for a simple fee-for-service contract, -2 for being cut out completely.",
