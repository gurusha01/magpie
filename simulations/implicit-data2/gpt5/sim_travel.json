The plan must cover the venue, schedule, security protocols, and budget. The negotiation is complicated by conflicting priorities, severe budget constraints, unshared intelligence on security threats, and clandestine political objectives that could derail the entire summit if mishandled.",

Task: A group of six stakeholders must negotiate and finalize a comprehensive plan for a secret, two-day diplomatic summit between the United States and the Republic of Kasnia, to be held in the neutral city of Valta, Sonderland. The plan must cover the venue, schedule, security protocols, and budget. The negotiation is complicated by conflicting priorities, severe budget constraints, unshared intelligence on security threats, and clandestine political objectives that could derail the entire summit if mishandled.. Deliverable: A single, finalized 'Memorandum of Understanding for Summit Logistics and Security' document, co-signed by all six parties, detailing the venue, schedule, budget, and security arrangements."
