A block of this size is essential for us to deploy our next-generation 'HyperBand 5G' service, which promises gigabit speeds and is the cornerstone of our next five-year strategy. Anything less than 60 MHz would be considered a major failure. The utility for this preference is as follows: >=80 MHz (+2), 60-79 MHz (+1), 40-59 MHz (-1), <40 MHz (-2).",

Specifically: Major Reed's private knowledge that a 10 MHz guard band is sufficient (instead of her public demand for 20 MHz) frees up an extra 10 MHz of spectrum. This makes it possible to allocate 80 MHz to OmniWave and 20 MHz to AetherLink, or a similar division. Chloe's secret high budget and Ben's secret revenue goal are compatible. A potential solution involves Major Reed conceding to a 10 MHz guard band in exchange for strict power controls (which Chloe's secret tech can help mitigate), allowing the FCC to auction 90 MHz. Ben could create a new entrant set-aside for 20 MHz, which Liam wins for ~$4B. Chloe wins the remaining 70 MHz for ~$22B. This meets Ben's political revenue goal ($26B total), satisfies Liam, and gives Chloe a large, albeit not perfect, block while hitting her bonus target.
