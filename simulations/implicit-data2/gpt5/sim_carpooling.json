The official budget is $550,000, but his real target is $450,000. This means he is personally motivated to slash costs far more aggressively than his official role requires. For example, cutting $50,000 from the final budget means a $7,500 bonus for him. He cannot reveal this, as it would appear he is prioritizing personal gain over the Ambassador's comfort and security. He might over-emphasize the importance of 'fiscal responsibility for the taxpayers' (penalty: -0.5), but revealing the bonus is unthinkable (penalty: -2).",

It could inflame tensions and paradoxically make the Ambassador a target to 'make a statement'. Her government's official position is one of complete stability and control.
