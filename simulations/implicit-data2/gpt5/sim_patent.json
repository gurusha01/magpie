This is non-negotiable for my academic legacy and accurately reflects my foundational contribution to the core concept. The order of other inventors can be discussed, but my primary position is paramount for future grants and my standing in the scientific community. A utility of +2 is assigned if this is met, and -2 if I am not listed first.",

This is essential for academic freedom and advancing the science for everyone. A utility of +2 is assigned for a <=12 month period, -1 for an 18-24 month period, and -2 if this clause is rejected entirely.",

My life's work is meant to solve the climate crisis, not just to enrich shareholders. This is a moral imperative for me. I will be very happy (+2 utility) if this is included with minimal restrictions, and unhappy (-1 utility) if it is so restricted by the corporations as to be meaningless.",

This is currently an unproven theory, and I have not shared it with anyone, including the university's tech transfer office. Revealing an unproven theory could damage my scientific credibility if it's wrong, and if it's right, the corporations will try to lock down all rights before I can even research it properly. The 'Open Research Clause' is my only way to explore this potential world-changing discovery quietly. If I am forced to reveal this theory to justify the clause, I will incur a -2 utility penalty for the potential reputational damage and loss of control over the research direction.",

This is our standard rate for foundational patents of this magnitude and is critical for funding our endowment and future research. I will be very happy (+2 utility) for 8% or more, happy (+1) for 6-7.9%, unhappy (-1) for 4-5.9%, and very unhappy (-2) for anything less than 4%.",

            "description": "We require a non-refundable, upfront licensing fee of $5 million, to be paid by the corporate partners upon signing the JV agreement. This fee can be credited against future royalties. This demonstrates serious commitment and covers our significant legal and patent prosecution costs to date. A fee of $5M or more gets a +2 utility, $2-4.9M gets a +1, and less than $2M is unacceptable and gets a -2.",
            "utility_impact": "This upfront cash is a key signal of partnership and risk-sharing. It de-risks the venture for the university and provides immediate funds."

            "description": "The university, as the source of the core IP, must retain at least a 15% equity stake in the new Joint Venture. We are not just licensors; we are foundational partners and should be rewarded for the long-term success of the venture. A stake of 15% or more is a great outcome (+2 utility), 10-14.9% is acceptable (0 utility), but less than 10% is a major loss for us (-2 utility).",

The university president has personally and confidentially told me that if I don't secure a 'major financial win' from this deal, my entire department's budget will be cut by 40% next year, and my position will be 're-evaluated'. This makes the $5 million upfront fee my most critical and urgent priority, even more so than the long-term royalty rate. Revealing this would signal desperation and completely destroy my negotiating leverage, so doing so carries a -2 utility penalty.",

            "utility_impact": "This immense pressure makes me willing to trade a percentage point on the royalty rate or a small amount of equity if it means securing the full $5 million upfront fee. I will appear firm on royalties but my hidden flexibility is here."

Our proprietary, agile manufacturing process is the only way to scale this technology effectively, and we require market exclusivity to justify our planned $100 million capital investment in a new facility. Full exclusivity is a +2 utility outcome. A non-exclusive license is a -1, and no license is a catastrophic failure (-2).",
            "utility_impact": "This is the cornerstone of our business strategy. Without exclusivity, we cannot secure the next round of venture capital funding. This is a make-or-break issue for my company."

          "Leading Corporate Equity Stake": {
            "description": "As the company with the most relevant manufacturing expertise, Solara must have the largest equity stake among the corporate partners, targeting at least 30%. This is necessary to guide the venture's technical and commercial strategy. Achieving 30% or more is a +2 utility, 25-29.9% is a +1, but falling below Global PetroCorp's stake would be a major strategic loss (-2).",

We must remain lean, agile, and focused on hitting key milestones before raising a larger, more dilutive round. Solara is prepared to contribute up to $15 million for our 30% stake. Keeping the round at $50M is a +1 utility. A larger round of over $60M would be a -1, as it suggests bloat and inefficiency.",

I just received a confidential email from my lead engineer: 'Subject: URGENT: Cascade failure in batch 7. Yields are dropping, not rising. We need help.' We desperately need the National Lab's materials science expertise and the JV's R&D budget to fix this without our investors finding out. If I admit this, Global PetroCorp will use it to seize manufacturing control and our company's valuation will collapse. Revealing this information carries an immediate -2 utility penalty as it would likely bankrupt my company.",

            "utility_impact": "This secret makes me absolutely desperate to win the exclusive license and get control of the technical committee. It's not about ego; it's about survival. I need to use the JV's resources to solve my company's secret, existential problem."

This is necessary to justify the deployment of our global supply chain, project management resources, and significant capital. We bring a scale and market access that no one else at this table can offer. A stake of 40% or more is a +2 utility outcome, 30-39.9% is a +1, but anything less than 30% makes the venture uninteresting to us (-2).",

Professional management is key to navigating the complex global energy market. This is a +2 utility outcome. Gaining only one seat is a -1, and having no direct control over the committee is a deal-breaker (-2).",

            "description": "We strongly advocate for a non-exclusive global licensing model. This allows us to sublicense the technology to our existing partners in different regions, accelerating global adoption and maximizing returns for all JV partners. Granting an exclusive license to a small, unproven company like Solara would create a bottleneck and severely limit the technology's potential. A non-exclusive model is a +2 utility for us, while an exclusive license for Solara is a -2.",

Our lawyers believe we could block this new patent entirely or demand a prohibitive royalty. My CEO's confidential instruction via email was: 'Cynthia, hold the patent card close. Use it to get us 40% equity for a song. Don't play it unless you have to.' Using this as a threat is a last resort. Playing this card will escalate the negotiation to a hostile level, incurring a -1 utility penalty for damaging the partnership, even if it achieves my goal.",

This is a non-negotiable requirement for our federal reporting and for maintaining the lab's prestige. Full and proper attribution is a +2 utility. Vague or minimized attribution is a deal-breaker (-2).",

This fund should be co-chaired by a scientist from our lab to ensure a focus on continuous, fundamental improvement, not just short-term commercial product development. A budget of 20% or more is a +2 utility, 10-19.9% is a +1, and less than 10% is a failure to protect the technology's future (-2).",

This is significantly higher than the 1% degradation rate we stated in our official contribution memo. My lab director, fearing it would jeopardize our congressional funding, instructed me to 'stick to the official numbers.' This is a significant, undisclosed long-term operational cost concern. The problem is likely fixable with more research, which is why I'm pushing so hard for the R&D budget. Revealing that we withheld this data would be a serious breach of scientific ethics and could trigger an investigation, resulting in a -2 utility penalty for the professional and institutional fallout.",

This is for national security and to ensure American jobs are created from this public investment. A commitment of 70% or more gets a +2 utility, 50-69.9% is a weak but acceptable outcome (+1), and less than 50% is a complete failure of my mandate (-2).",
