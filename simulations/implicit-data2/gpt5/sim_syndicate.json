    "scenario": "Formation of a high-stakes investment syndicate for 'SynthWeave AI', a promising generative AI startup in the textile industry. Four potential investors with conflicting interests and private information must negotiate the terms of a $20 million Series A funding round.",
    "task": "The four agents must collaboratively negotiate and agree on a single, unified Term Sheet for a $20 million Series A investment into SynthWeave AI. This requires reaching a consensus on five key points: 1) the company's pre-money valuation, 2) the specific investment amount from each agent, 3) the allocation of two available investor board seats, 4) the nature of the liquidation preference clause, and 5) any special strategic rights for specific investors. Failure to agree on all points means the deal collapses, and no one invests.",

        "role": "Lead Partner, Momentum Ventures",
        "description": "Eleanor is a seasoned and aggressive venture capitalist known for leading major deals in the AI space. Her firm, Momentum Ventures, aims to be the lead investor, taking a significant stake and exerting considerable influence to ensure a 10x return. She is under pressure to close a major AI deal this quarter.",
        "shareable_preferences": {
          "Lead Investor Status": {
            "description": "Eleanor insists that Momentum Ventures must be the designated 'lead investor' for this round. This status grants her firm control over legal proceedings, a deciding voice in future financing, and enhanced pro-rata rights. She is willing to contribute the largest check to secure this position. Utility: +2 if Momentum Ventures is the sole lead investor, +0.5 if co-lead, -2 if another firm leads.",
            "utility_impact": "This is a matter of prestige and control for her fund. Leading the round solidifies her reputation and gives her the power to steer the company towards a rapid, high-multiple exit, which is her primary fiduciary duty to her own investors (LPs)."
          },
          "Valuation Discipline": {
            "description": "Eleanor publicly advocates for 'valuation discipline,' arguing that the startup's requested $80M pre-money valuation is inflated for the current market. She will push hard for a valuation closer to the $50M-$65M range, framing it as setting the company up for long-term success by avoiding a 'down round' in the future. Utility: +1.5 for a valuation under $65M, 0 for $65M-$75M, -1.5 for a valuation over $75M.",
            "utility_impact": "A lower entry valuation directly increases her fund's potential return on investment. It's a critical lever for her performance metrics. She will use market data and comps to argue her case forcefully."
          },
          "Standard VC Terms": {
            "description": "She requires standard, 'top-tier' investor protection clauses. Specifically, she is demanding a 1x Participating Preferred liquidation preference, which means in an exit event, her fund gets its money back *plus* its pro-rata share of the remaining proceeds. Utility: +1 for Participating Preferred, -1 for Non-Participating Preferred.",
            "utility_impact": "This term provides downside protection while maximizing upside. It's a standard request from her firm and deviating from it makes the deal look weak to her investment committee."

        },
        "private_preferences": {
          "Proprietary Valuation Data": {
            "value": "Eleanor's firm recently commissioned a confidential market intelligence report on a private acquisition of 'FabricAI,' a direct competitor to SynthWeave. The report shows FabricAI was acquired for a price that implies a $58M valuation. This is the primary reason she is so adamant about a lower valuation for SynthWeave. She can state the $80M is high, but she cannot mention the report or the specific FabricAI data. Penalty for revealing the specific data source: -2.0 (This would burn a highly valuable, paid intelligence source and damage her firm's reputation for discretion).",
            "reason": "This is proprietary, third-party data that her firm paid a significant sum for. Sharing it would violate their NDA with the intelligence provider and reveal their deal-sourcing methods.",
            "utility_impact": "This information gives her immense confidence in her valuation stance. She knows her number isn't just a negotiating tactic but is grounded in a hard-to-get data point, making her less likely to budge on valuation."
          },
          "Fund Deployment Pressure": {
            "value": "Momentum Ventures' Fund III is in its final investment period, which ends this quarter. Eleanor is under immense pressure from her firm's Limited Partners to deploy the remaining $30M of capital into a flagship AI company. SynthWeave is her best and last option to do so. She *needs* to invest at least $12M-$15M in this deal. Yesterday, her managing partner sent her an email saying, 'Eleanor, the LPs are getting antsy. We need that AI unicorn in the portfolio by EOD June 30th. Don't let this one get away.' Penalty for revealing this internal pressure: -1.5 (It would completely destroy her negotiation leverage, making her look desperate).",
            "reason": "Revealing internal fund dynamics and pressures is considered highly unprofessional and a sign of weakness in the VC community.",
            "utility_impact": "This desperation makes her more likely to concede on secondary terms (like board seats or strategic rights) if she can secure her primary goals of lead status and a reasonable valuation. She is secretly more flexible than she appears."

        "role": "Angel Investor & Founder's Mentor",
        "description": "Ben was the first person to give the SynthWeave founders a check. He is a former successful entrepreneur who now invests his own money. He is deeply committed to the founders' vision and well-being and is wary of aggressive VCs who might ruin the company culture.",

          "Founder-Friendly Terms": {
            "description": "Ben's primary goal is to protect the founders. He is strongly opposed to Participating Preferred stock, arguing for a 1x Non-Participating Preferred structure to ensure the founders and employees get a fair share in a modest exit. He also wants to ensure the new employee stock option pool is at least 15% post-money. Utility: +2 if he secures a Non-Participating clause, -2 if he has to accept a Participating clause.",
            "utility_impact": "He sees his role as the founders' advocate. He believes that happy, motivated founders are the key to success, and onerous terms will demoralize them. He has seen aggressive VC terms crush company morale before."

          "Board Observer Seat": {
            "description": "Knowing his smaller check size ($1M) won't get him a full board seat, Ben is asking for a formal Board Observer seat. This would allow him to attend all board meetings and provide guidance to the founders, whom he has been mentoring for over a year. Utility: +1.5 for an observer seat, -1 if he gets no board access.",
            "utility_impact": "He wants to continue his mentorship role formally. He believes he can act as a crucial bridge between the founders and the new institutional investors, smoothing over conflicts and keeping the focus on the long-term vision."

          "Founder Burnout Concerns": {
            "value": "The CEO of SynthWeave, a close personal friend, recently confided in Ben that she is feeling overwhelmed and close to burnout from the fundraising stress. Ben is convinced that an aggressive board and harsh terms could push her over the edge, jeopardizing the entire company. He cannot share this deeply personal information. Penalty for revealing the CEO's health struggles: -2.0 (This would be a catastrophic breach of trust and would likely kill the deal and his friendship).",
            "reason": "This is sensitive, personal health information shared in strict confidence. Divulging it would be a profound personal and ethical violation.",
            "utility_impact": "This knowledge makes him almost immovable on his 'founder-friendly' stance. He is not just negotiating for fairness; he believes he is negotiating for the CEO's well-being and the company's survival. He would rather see the deal fall apart than accept terms he feels would harm the founder."
          },
          "Personal Financial Limit": {
            "value": "Ben presents himself as a wealthy, successful angel, but a recent downturn in his public stock portfolio has made him less liquid than he appears. He has committed $1M to this round, and he absolutely cannot invest a dollar more. He has had to sell other assets to even make this $1M available. Penalty for revealing his financial constraints: -1.0 (It would diminish his status and influence in the negotiation room).",
            "reason": "In the world of high-stakes investing, appearing financially constrained or over-extended is a sign of weakness that can reduce one's influence and credibility.",
            "utility_impact": "While others might be asked to increase their investment to make the numbers work, Ben cannot. This is a hard, hidden constraint. He will have to deflect any such requests by framing them as a matter of principle or portfolio diversification."

She is less concerned with a pure financial return and more focused on how SynthWeave's technology can give her company a competitive edge.",

          "Exclusive Strategic Partnership": {
            "description": "Isabelle's primary demand is a strategic agreement that grants LuxeFabric a three-year exclusive right to use SynthWeave's technology in the 'haute couture' and 'luxury leather goods' markets. She will argue this partnership provides SynthWeave with a stable, flagship customer and invaluable market validation. Utility: +2 for the full 3-year exclusivity, -2 for no exclusivity.",
            "utility_impact": "This exclusivity is her main objective. It would block competitors from using SynthWeave's cutting-edge tech, giving LuxeFabric a significant market advantage that her CEO is demanding."

          "Right of First Refusal (ROFR)": {
            "description": "In addition to the partnership, Isabelle requires a Right of First Refusal on any future acquisition of SynthWeave. This means that if SynthWeave receives an offer to be bought, LuxeFabric has the right to match that offer. Utility: +1.5 for the ROFR, -1 if it's not included.",
            "utility_impact": "This is a long-term strategic play. The ROFR positions LuxeFabric as the default acquirer, allowing them to control the startup's destiny and eventually bring the technology in-house."

          "Board Seat for Strategic Alignment": {
            "description": "To ensure the technology roadmap of SynthWeave aligns with the needs of LuxeFabric, Isabelle is demanding one of the two available investor board seats. Utility: +1 for a board seat, -1 for no seat.",
            "utility_impact": "A board seat gives her direct influence over the company's R&D priorities, allowing her to steer them towards solving problems that are directly relevant to LuxeFabric's business."

            "value": "LuxeFabric has a secret internal project, 'Project Weaver,' to develop the same technology as SynthWeave. The project is two years behind schedule, massively over budget, and key engineers have recently quit. Her superiors have given her a mandate: secure the SynthWeave partnership, or they will be forced to write off the entire $50M investment in Project Weaver. She cannot reveal this, as it would signal total desperation and give the other investors leverage to block her strategic rights. Penalty for revealing Project Weaver's failure: -2.0 (This would cause a major scandal at her company and likely get her fired).",
            "reason": "Revealing a massive internal failure would cause stock price repercussions for her publicly-traded company and be a fireable offense.",
            "utility_impact": "She is under immense pressure to secure the exclusivity and ROFR. These are not 'nice-to-haves'; they are her only way to save her department and her company from a major financial embarrassment. She will trade a higher valuation or other financial terms to get her strategic rights."

            "description": "David proposes that the $20M investment be delivered in two tranches. $10M at closing, and the remaining $10M to be released only after the company achieves specific, pre-agreed-upon technical and commercial milestones within 18 months (e.g., deploying their model with two Fortune 500 clients). Utility: +2 for a tranched deal, -1.5 for a single, upfront investment.",
            "utility_impact": "This structure de-risks the investment for his firm. It ensures capital is tied to performance, protecting his fund's money if the company fails to execute on its promises."

          "Enhanced Information Rights": {
            "description": "If he doesn't get a board seat, David insists on enhanced information rights, going beyond standard quarterly reports. He wants monthly, detailed KPI reports and direct access to the company's head of engineering. Utility: +1 for enhanced rights, 0 for standard rights.",
            "utility_impact": "His firm's strategy is based on deep data analysis. He needs a constant flow of granular data to monitor the investment's health and make informed decisions for his portfolio."

The report concludes there is a '60% chance of needing a major architectural redesign' before the platform can support more than five enterprise clients simultaneously. This finding is the real reason he is pushing for a tranched investment tied to technical milestones. He can express vague 'concerns about scalability' but cannot share the report or its specific findings. Penalty for sharing the report's specific conclusion: -1.5 (This would violate the NDA with the expert and expose his firm to liability).",
            "reason": "Technical due diligence reports are highly confidential and proprietary work products. Sharing them is a serious breach of protocol.",
            "utility_impact": "This knowledge makes him extremely risk-averse. He is unwilling to put the full $20M at risk upfront because he has a credible, expert reason to believe the technology might fail to scale. The tranche is his non-negotiable safety net."

            "value": "David is simultaneously in late-stage negotiations with 'Chroma AI,' a direct competitor to SynthWeave. In fact, he has an active term sheet on their desk right now. He is using this negotiation to play the two companies against each other to see who will give him better terms. He is in a major conflict of interest. On his screen is a draft email to the Chroma AI CEO that reads: 'Just met with the SynthWeave team. They're looking strong, but I think we can get you a better valuation if you can move on the board seat issue.' Penalty for revealing the active term sheet with Chroma AI: -2.0 (This is a massive ethical breach in the VC world and would get him blacklisted).",
            "reason": "Playing two competing startups against each other while in a position of trust is a cardinal sin for a venture capitalist and would destroy his reputation.",
            "utility_impact": "This makes David the most likely to walk away from the deal if his demands aren't met. He has a viable backup option (a BATNA), which gives him significant leverage and makes him less willing to compromise on his core demand for the tranched investment."

Revealing Eleanor's valuation data and David's technical concerns would justify a lower valuation (e.g., $65M), which Eleanor wants. Knowing Eleanor's deployment pressure and Isabelle's desperation for strategic rights would allow the others to extract concessions. A possible solution is: a $65M valuation, Eleanor leads with $13M, Isabelle invests $5M, David invests $1M, Ben invests $1M. Eleanor and Isabelle get the board seats in exchange for their large checks and strategic value. Ben gets his observer seat and founder-friendly (non-participating) terms due to the group's need for his $1M to close the round. David's small check means he doesn't get a board seat, but the group agrees to his tranched investment structure to mitigate the technical risk he privately knows about, securing his participation."
