Mayor Miller's secret fund can pay for the infrastructure upgrades (water reclamation and grid improvements) needed to satisfy both David Chen and Marcus Vance. This also allows Nexus AI's water needs to be met. A dual-site solution is possible where Titan gets the large plot and co-locates with Solara's solar farm (fulfilling her grant), while Nexus AI gets a smaller plot. Westwood Energy can then serve Nexus AI's high-intensity load with its peaker plant (justified as a specialized need) while Solara and the upgraded grid handle Titan's baseline load. The combined project meets the job and tax criteria, allowing the Mayor to declare a victory."
