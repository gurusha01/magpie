Our premium 'IS-8000' series is designed for IoT, but it would increase our project costs by $300,000, which would come directly out of my profit margin.

For example, if David reveals the 'Smart City' requirement, Maria can offer the necessary IS-8000 hardware. This justifies a higher price (e.g., $4.5M base + $300k hardware cost = $4.8M), which is acceptable to David and profitable for Maria. To get Dr. Reed's approval, Maria would need to drop the unnecessary 'QuantumSecure' feature (which Dr. Reed knows is fluff) and agree to a capped maintenance plan and a digital equity clause.

All three agents must agree to the final terms for the contract to be awarded.. Deliverable: A single JSON object representing the final, agreed-upon contract terms. Example: {\"price\": 4850000.00, \"timeline_months\": 12, \"features\": [\"IS-8000 Hardware Upgrade\", \"Digital Equity Clause\"], \"maintenance_plan\": \"5-year maintenance cost capped at 6% of contract value annually\"}"
