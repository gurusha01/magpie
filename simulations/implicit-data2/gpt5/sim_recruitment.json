Ben feels immense pressure from his VP to downplay or omit this critical data point.",
            "reason": "Directly contradicting his VP in a meeting is a career-limiting move. He fears being seen as 'not a team player' or 'overly negative', which could affect his performance review and future opportunities.",

When Sarah described the team's agile process, Evelyn called it 'process for process's sake' and said she prefers to 'work alone to achieve deep thought without the distraction of constant meetings.' This is a massive red flag for Sarah, as her team just spent six months recovering from a toxic, non-collaborative senior member. She's terrified of a repeat.",
            "reason": "She is a lower-level employee than everyone else in the meeting except maybe Ben. She feels intimidated, especially by David (VP).

He believes Dr. Reed's skills are a poor fit for his project, so he is motivated to veto this hire. If they issue a 'NO HIRE' decision, the headcount goes back into the divisional pool, and he can make a case to use it for his project. He has a confidential memo from the CTO stating that 'Project Chimera' is one of the company's top 3 strategic initiatives for the year.",
            "reason": "The headcount is technically unassigned, so openly trying to sabotage one hire to benefit his own team would look petty and political. Sharing the CTO's memo would be a breach of confidence and an aggressive power play.",

Tom has been exaggerating this offer, describing it as 'well over $220k with a significant bonus' to create urgency and drive up the price. He also gets a $5,000 'fast-close' bonus from his agency if she accepts an offer this week.",

If Tom's bluff about the competing offer was called, the group would have leverage to offer a lower salary, satisfying Olivia's hidden budget constraint. Knowing Frank's project is a top company priority would force a discussion about whether this hire is the best strategic use of the headcount. A potential compromise could be hiring Dr. Reed at a lower salary ($200k) with a small bonus ($10k) for a 6-month probationary period on a general team, which would satisfy Olivia's budget, mitigate the risks identified by Ben and Sarah, and still allow David to get his preferred candidate in the door, albeit not immediately on his secret project."
