    "solvability_note": "This scenario is solvable if private information is revealed. The discovery of the $800M required for the geological redesign (from Dr. Aris Thorne) makes the initial budget and profit goals of Elena Vance and Julian Croft impossible. This forces a major re-evaluation. Revealing Julian's personal land ownership and cost-cutting plans would discredit him, forcing Azure Power to accept a much lower profit margin and cover the redesign cost. Revealing the government's credit risk (from Elena Vance) creates a hard ceiling on public spending. This combination of facts forces the dam's capacity to be lowered to reduce cost, which could then satisfy Chayton Hinto's need to protect the sacred site. A smaller, safer, and less profitable dam becomes the only viable compromise that prevents total project failure for the government agents and avoids the worst outcomes for the opposition."
