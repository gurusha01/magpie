  "task": "A coalition of non-profits has secured a total budget of $250,000 for their joint 'Healthy Futures' initiative, aimed at promoting youth mental wellness. The four key stakeholders must collaboratively decide on the 6-month project calendar (July-December 2024). The core negotiation points are: 1) The official public launch date of the campaign. 2) The date for the high-stakes annual donor gala. 3) The specific allocation of the $250,000 budget across marketing, program activities, and administrative overhead.",

She argues that this allows for proper user testing of materials, adequate time for quality assurance, and prevents a stressful 'crunch' period for her team. An earlier launch would require significant overtime and rushing key deliverables.",
          "utility_impact": "Launch Date: A launch in October gets a utility of +2. A launch in late September is a +0. A launch in early September is a -2, as she knows it will severely strain her team and likely lead to mistakes."

She has managed enough projects to know that unexpected costs always arise (e.g., vendor price increases, software license needs), and without this buffer, any small problem could derail the entire project timeline.",
          "utility_impact": "Contingency Fund: A fund of $20,000 or more gets a utility of +1. A fund between $10,000 and $19,999 is a 0. A fund below $10,000 is a -1, as she feels it's fiscally irresponsible."

The email read: 'Maya, this is difficult to write, but I've accepted a position elsewhere... my last day will be June 28th.' Maya has not informed anyone yet. She knows that hiring and onboarding a qualified replacement will take at least 6-8 weeks. This makes delivering high-quality, final marketing assets for a launch before mid-October functionally impossible.",

She will therefore resist an early September launch at all costs, using vague terms like 'resource constraints' and 'quality assurance timelines' without revealing the specific, critical staffing gap."

David revealing the potential $50,000 grant for workshops incentivizes everyone to support Ben's preference, as the new money can be used to fund Chloe's revised (non-digital) marketing plan. A compromise exists where the launch is in mid-October, Chloe pivots to a PR and event-based marketing strategy funded by the new grant, the workshops are scheduled, and the gala happens in December."
