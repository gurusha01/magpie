This scientific justification would be more palatable to Chen than arbitrary 'cherry-picking.' Jenkins' need for insured patients could be met by framing the requirement as 'patients must have a documented ability to comply with long-term follow-up,' which correlates strongly with insurance without being explicitly discriminatory. Thorne's need to include his specific patient could be addressed by tailoring the 'liver mets' exclusion to be 'no active or progressing liver metastases,' potentially allowing his patient if the spots are minor and stable. Acknowledging these hidden drivers allows for a protocol that is scientifically sound, safe, and financially/regulatorily viable, meeting the core needs of all parties even if it doesn't match their initial public positions."
