His target price is $250,000 per 1,000-unit pallet. He can argue that this price is essential for funding future research.",
          "utility_impact": "Achieving a price of $250k/pallet or more would be a major success (+2). A price between $220k-$249k is a good outcome (+1). A price of $200k-$219k is considered the break-even point and is neutral (0). A price of $180k-$199k is disappointing and reflects poorly on his performance (-1). Anything below $180k is unacceptable and would require board-level justification (-2)."

          "utility_impact": "A commitment of 20,000 units/month or more is ideal (+2). 15,000-19,999 units is acceptable (+1). 10,000-14,999 units is the absolute minimum he can accept without re-evaluating the partnership (0). Anything less than 10,000 units is a poor deal (-1 to -2)."

          "utility_impact": "Strict adherence to the -75\u00b0C to -65\u00b0C range with full liability on the logistics partner is the only acceptable outcome (+2). Any negotiation that shifts liability back to PharmaCorp or widens the temperature range is highly undesirable (-1 to -2)."

This is due to a competitor's drug unexpectedly failing its final trial, causing PharmaCorp to overproduce in anticipation of a market fight. This surplus is currently costing the company $80,000 per day in specialized ultra-cold storage fees. This morning, Aris received a high-priority email from the CFO with the subject 'URGENT: CryoVax Inventory Crisis' stating, 'Aris, we need this product moved. We are projected to write off over $30M if this batch expires. Do what you have to do.' Sharing the existence of the surplus would crater his price negotiating power (penalty: -2). Hinting at a 'limited-time supply initiative' to encourage a quick deal might be a risky strategy (penalty: -1).",

He is secretly willing to accept a much lower price (even as low as $170k) if it means moving the entire surplus stock quickly. The pressure of the ticking clock is his primary, unstated driver."

CryoVax-S is stable at a standard freezer temperature of -20\u00b0C, making it dramatically cheaper to ship and store. This will render the current ultra-cold formulation obsolete. The project is codenamed 'Project Thaw' internally. Sharing this information would make it impossible to sign any long-term contracts for the current, difficult-to-handle version. (penalty: -2).",

The specified -75\u00b0C is dangerously close to this limit. Revealing this would instantly lose them the contract and cause a major scandal (penalty: -2). Suggesting a 'slightly wider operational temperature band for improved efficiency,' like -70\u00b0C to -60\u00b0C, is a tactic she might use, but it's a risky lie (penalty: -1 if questioned deeply).",
          "reason": "Admitting to such a critical infrastructure vulnerability would destroy their reputation as a reliable ultra-cold logistics provider and lead to immediate contract termination and potential lawsuits.",

She needs the high-margin revenue from this specific contract to get board approval for the pay rise and avert the strike, which would cripple her entire regional operation. Revealing the strike threat would signal operational instability and make clients unwilling to sign long-term contracts (penalty: -2).",
          "reason": "Information about a potential labor strike signals unreliability and would cause any potential client to hesitate in signing a critical supply chain contract.",

Ben has a hard, non-negotiable cap of $3.5 million per month for the total CryoVax contract (price x volume). This figure is his absolute limit.
