Three parties have promising but incomplete solutions. The agents must negotiate and agree on the distribution of the prize money, the structure of intellectual property (IP) ownership, the funding and timeline for future clinical trials, and a strategy for patient access and drug pricing.

A utility of +2 is achieved if I am the sole lead inventor and my lab gets a dedicated research budget of $5M from the prize. +1 for co-lead inventor status with veto power on research direction. 0 for a simple shared IP agreement. -1 if my lab is relegated to a contractor role. -2 if InnovatePharma absorbs all IP without acknowledging my foundational contribution.",

Ben Carter's and Lena Petrova's desperation makes them more likely to accept a lower but still profitable acquisition offer from Marcus Vance, who can afford to be generous if he knows it's the only way to get a 'fast-tracked' drug. Julian Croft's leverage can secure a price cap, which Marcus may concede in exchange for the massive overall value of the deal."
