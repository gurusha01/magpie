The deal is worth approximately $2 million per year for Apex, but it is strictly contingent on the site being delivered 'pad-ready' (flat, stable, accessible) within 24 months. If the plan involves creating varied terrain like hills or wetlands, the deal is off. I cannot reveal the existence of SunVolt or this deal due to a strict NDA.",

Admitting to any widespread contamination or agreeing to extensive, unscheduled soil testing in that quadrant could jeopardize the settlement, transforming it from a potential $500k payout into a $10M+ class-action lawsuit. I can argue against 'unnecessary testing' on the basis of cost, but I cannot reveal the true legal and contamination risk.",

This bonus is a significant part of my expected annual income.",

The data is inadmissible and I cannot mention its existence. If I do, the data will be thrown out, the tech could face legal trouble, and I would face a serious internal investigation for using un-vetted data.",

I have some leeway, but if this negotiation stalls and becomes a public fight, my career progression will be stalled.",

Lena's knowledge of contamination, if she can force new testing, would make David's cheap 'cap and cover' plan non-compliant and legally risky, jeopardizing the solar deal's timeline and stability requirements. This forces Apex to consider a more expensive, thorough cleanup. David's budget crisis can then be solved by Maria revealing her $3 million grant, which bridges the financial gap to afford the full ecological restoration. In exchange for avoiding a lawsuit and gaining positive PR, Apex can agree to the park concept. The final agreement would be a publicly-accessible ecological park with a wetland center, funded by a combination of Apex's increased (but legally necessary) budget and the Conservancy's grant, satisfying the core goals of all three parties."
