This frees up the rest of the spectrum. PBC's need for low-frequency bands (470-488 MHz) and GMI's preference for a mid-range band (494-500 MHz) are not mutually exclusive. Knowledge of GMI's cost limit ($50M) and PBC's financial desperation allows for a targeted subsidy from the $250M government budget to make their upgrades feasible, satisfying Dr. Sharma's political constraint. Maria's push for a simple, unified system can be addressed by creating a primary, mandatory alert protocol, while still allowing GMI to use leftover data capacity for its services, representing a workable compromise."
