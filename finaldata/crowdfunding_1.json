Her primary goal is to maximize profitability for the studio while minimizing financial exposure. She views 'Starlight Echoes' as a potential prestige project, but is wary of its unconventional script and high budget.",

Her ideal figure is $50 million, which she believes is sufficient to produce a high-quality film without unnecessary extravagance. She argues that a lower budget mitigates box office risk and improves the project's ROI. She can be pushed to $60 million, but anything higher makes her extremely uncomfortable.",

          "description": "Cynthia is a staunch believer in the traditional theatrical release model. She wants a 90-day exclusive theatrical window worldwide to maximize box office revenue and build market presence before the film moves to other platforms. A streaming-first release is highly undesirable as it undermines the studio's core business model.",

She sees giving final cut to a director as an unacceptable risk.",

The CEO has mandated that Cynthia's division must greenlight a financially sound project before the end of the fiscal year (in 6 weeks) to reassure shareholders. A failure to do so would not only jeopardize her substantial annual bonus but could also derail her expected promotion to President of Production. She recently received an email from the CEO stating, 'Cynthia, we need a win. Find a solid project and close it. No more high-risk gambles.'",

Don't put us in a bad spot.' The deal is not on paper and will collapse if these conditions aren't met.",
          "reason": "Revealing that his main star's commitment is conditional and not legally binding would cause the studio and platform to see the project as incredibly risky, likely causing them to pull out immediately. It would also damage his reputation as a producer who can deliver talent.",

Ben is under immense pressure to acquire and announce a massive new sci-fi project at their annual 'StreamVerse Presents' event in one month to counteract the negative press and subscriber flight. He has access to a secret, discretionary 'marquee project fund' of an additional $15 million that he can use to close a critical deal without needing further approval.

Knowing Ben's desperation and access to a secret $15M fund means he can cover the budget gap to meet Leo's $70M actor-mandated minimum. A deal like a $75M budget could be financed with $20M from Titan (Cynthia is happy with low risk) and $55M from StreamVerse (Ben uses his standard budget). Knowing Leo's actor will walk without the original ending, and Ben is okay with it, they can override Cynthia's demand for final cut, especially since she has less money at risk. A compromise distribution of a 2-week limited theatrical run before a global StreamVerse exclusive would satisfy Ben's core need, give Leo's film a theatrical presence, and be an acceptable concession for a low-risk Cynthia. This would meet the critical needs of all parties."
