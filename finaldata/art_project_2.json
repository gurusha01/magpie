He prefers materials like polished granite, stainless steel, and pre-cast concrete over materials like Corten steel (which can stain surrounding pavement) or complex electronics that require specialized technicians. A plan with costs under 1% is a +2 utility for him. A plan between 1-2% is +1. Anything between 2-3% is a -1, and a plan with projected costs over 3% ($36,000/year) is a non-starter and a -2 utility.",

Achieving this 60/40 split gives him a +2 utility. A 50/50 split is acceptable (+1), but if the art component exceeds 50% of the total budget, his utility drops to -1, as he sees it as fiscally irresponsible.",

Its maintenance costs have hit $80k a year. If the Gateway project has long-term costs exceeding 2% of its budget, it will kill your promotion and be a black mark on my legacy. Do not let that happen.' Revealing the personal career threat would be a -2 penalty for appearing self-serving. Revealing only that his department is under general pressure to reduce maintenance costs is a minor -0.5 penalty.",

She believes this is the minimum required for a truly world-class installation. Securing $720k or more for the art is a +2 utility. Getting between $600k-$719k is +1.

The foundation's chair told her in a private meeting, 'Maria, we see this as the test case. If you deliver a bland, safe project, the endowment is off the table.' Sharing this information would cause widespread panic among local arts groups and give the Langford Foundation immense, inappropriate leverage over a public project. Revealing the ultimatum would be a -3 penalty. Hinting at a 'major funding opportunity' tied to the project is a -1 penalty.",

Securing the full $650k is a +2 utility. Anything between $600k-$649k is a +1, requiring him to make minor cuts.

She is concerned that the runoff from Julian's proposed Corten steel sculpture will permanently stain these lighter-colored, porous materials. Getting her material choices approved is a +2 utility. A compromise using less-stainable materials like granite is +1. Having to design around the staining issue with extensive drainage and sacrificial surfaces is a -1.",

The current foundation cannot support that concentrated load. Reinforcing it would require deep pilings and would cost an estimated $150,000, which would have to come out of her firm's budget or be added to the project, causing a major overage. Revealing this now would make her firm look incompetent for missing it in their initial bid and could jeopardize their contract. The penalty for revealing this major oversight would be -3. She is trying to solve the problem by advocating for a lighter or more distributed artwork that doesn't require the costly reinforcement.",

Their lawyer has sent a formal letter to Ben stating they are prepared to file an injunction to halt construction and launch a negative PR campaign, citing light pollution ordinances, if 'any artwork with active, bright, or flashing illumination' is approved. Ben's mandate from this group is to kill the light sculpture concept by any means necessary, without revealing the threat.
