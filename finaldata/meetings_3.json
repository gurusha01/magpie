  "task": "A crisis response meeting has been called for the top leadership of 'Innovate Tomorrow', a mid-sized tech company. Their flagship social networking app, 'ConnectSphere', has suffered a major data breach, exfiltrating the personal data and private messages of millions of users. The breach was discovered 36 hours ago. The media is not yet aware, but a prominent cybersecurity blogger has started asking pointed questions online. The leadership team must negotiate and unanimously agree on a comprehensive 'Crisis Response Plan' before the legally mandated 72-hour disclosure deadline expires.",

          "utility_impact": "Getting a budget over $7M for a strong response plan results in a utility of +2. A budget between $4M-$7M is a weak compromise, yielding a utility of -1. Anything less than $4M is a disaster in her eyes, resulting in a utility of -2."

If this email leaks, it proves she prioritized speed over security for personal gain. She can allude to 'aggressive launch targets' (penalty: -1), but sharing the email or the bonus amount is catastrophic (penalty: -2).",
