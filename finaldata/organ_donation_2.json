For his government, this agreement is a major public relations opportunity to showcase international cooperation and technological advancement. His primary mandate is to protect Aethelgard's interests, which he interprets as maximizing the benefit for Aethelgard's citizens while keeping government costs to a minimum.",

          "description": "Dr. Finch insists on a patient matching algorithm that gives preference to Aethelgard citizens. His proposed model is 'Aethelgard Priority': if a medically suitable Aethelgard citizen is on the waitlist, they receive an organ from an Aethelgard donor, even if a Borealis patient is a slightly better medical match (within a 5% compatibility margin). He argues this is essential for maintaining public support and securing government funding for the program. Getting this clause passed is his top priority (Utility: +2). A 50/50 split or 'Best Match First' model is highly undesirable (Utility: -2).",
          "utility_impact": "This is a non-negotiable starting point for him, as it was a direct order from the Minister of Health. He will frame this as a matter of national sovereignty and responsibility to his taxpayers. Failure to secure this would be seen as a major political failure."

He wants to see the total annual budget not exceed $8 million to avoid further parliamentary scrutiny. Securing a deal at or below a $3.2M contribution for Aethelgard would be a major success (Utility: +2). Contributing more than 50% ($5M on a $10M budget) would be a disaster for him (Utility: -2).",
          "utility_impact": "He will use budget constraints as a powerful lever, claiming his government's funds are limited. This allows him to push back against expensive proposals from other agents and steer the deal towards a structure that is financially and politically safe for him."

The report reveals that due to pressure to meet donation quotas, a systemic 'protocol deviation' occurred over the last six months, resulting in approximately 12% of donor serology (virology) screenings being rushed and improperly documented. While no adverse patient outcomes have been linked yet, the potential for transmitting diseases is a public health time bomb. His Minister has ordered him to 'make this problem disappear' by securing this deal, which will allow them to quietly implement stricter Borealis standards as a 'positive upgrade' without admitting the existing failure. Leaking the existence of a report on 'screening irregularities' carries a -1 utility penalty. Leaking the report's name (MH-734), the hospital (St. Jude's), or the 12% figure carries a catastrophic -2 penalty and would end his career.",

This technology costs approximately $50,000 per transit. She argues that this is the only way to guarantee organ quality over the distances involved and is the ethical choice. Securing this as the sole mandated protocol is a primary goal (Utility: +2). Using standard cooler-on-ice methods for any organs is unacceptable (Utility: -2).",

Dr. Petrova advocates for a purely medical 'Best Match First' algorithm, where the organ always goes to the patient with the highest compatibility score and medical urgency, regardless of nationality. She believes this is the only ethically defensible position. Securing this principle is critical for her and her institute's values (Utility: +2). Any form of national preference is a major ethical breach in her eyes (Utility: -2).",

A major philanthropic grant they depended on was unexpectedly withdrawn last month, leaving a $4 million annual deficit. Without a significant new source of funding or patient volume, the BTI will face severe cutbacks, including the potential closure of its pediatric transplant wing, within 12 months. This cross-border agreement, with its associated government funding and increased patient volume (which brings revenue), is a financial lifeline. Admitting they are desperate for funds would cripple her negotiating power (penalty: -1). Revealing the exact $4M deficit or the risk to the pediatric wing would be devastating to morale and their reputation (penalty: -2).",
          "reason": "Public knowledge of the institute's financial instability would cause a loss of donor confidence, staff departures, and could jeopardize their accreditation.",

She needs the deal to pass, which might make her more receptive to finding a creative solution if she feels a total impasse is imminent.

The committee must have the authority to conduct unannounced inspections of facilities in both countries and review all patient/donor records.

If she makes a formal accusation and is wrong, the GHJF could be sued for defamation, and her professional credibility would be shattered. She needs to find a way to get Dr. Finch to reveal something or get her independent oversight committee established so she can investigate legally. Making a public accusation without proof carries a -2 utility penalty. Hinting broadly about 'rumors of quality control issues' is a risky gambit but carries a lower penalty (-1).",

He will strongly advocate for the cost-effectiveness of the Standard Tier, suggesting it be used for 'most cases', with the Premium Tier reserved for 'extreme circumstances'.

We are not capable of flying a single LifeBox mission.' His company is too deep in debt to afford this repair without first securing this contract's revenue stream. His high price of $60k/transit for the 'Premium Tier' is designed to make the $15k 'Standard Tier' seem like an irresistible bargain.

This exposes Mr. Thorne's inability to provide the premium service required for the now-critical quality oversight. The money saved by not paying for Thorne's fraudulent 'Premium Tier' can be reallocated to fund Ms. Rossi's independent oversight committee and the BTI's quality control program. This allows Finch to solve his scandal quietly, Petrova to save her institute financially, Rossi to get the ethical oversight she demands, and Thorne to still secure a smaller, but honest and profitable, contract for his Standard Tier logistics. This transforms the negotiation from a zero-sum conflict to a collaborative problem-solving exercise."
