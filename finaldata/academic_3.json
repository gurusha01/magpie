      "description": "A world-renowned but somewhat arrogant AI researcher who is the primary instructor for CS701. His reputation is closely tied to the success and prestige of this seminar. He views it as a critical tool for recruiting top-tier PhD students and impressing industry partners and funding agencies.",

        "Prime Time Slot": {
          "description": "He strongly desires a prime, high-visibility time slot to maximize attendance and accommodate the schedules of potential industry guests. His ideal slot is Tuesday from 2 PM to 5 PM. He considers a Friday afternoon slot a 'graveyard slot' that signals the course is unimportant. He will argue that a prime slot is non-negotiable for a course of this caliber.",

          "description": "He insists on using Room 415-B, the department's new 'smart' classroom. It features a multi-camera setup for high-quality lecture recording, an interactive smartboard, and modular seating ideal for the breakout sessions he plans. He believes using any other room, like the standard Room 301, would compromise the pedagogical quality and technological showcase aspect of the seminar.",

          "description": "To maintain the seminar's prestige, he wants to invite leading researchers from major tech companies. These speakers often require honorariums and have their travel expenses covered. He is pushing for a guest speaker fund of at least $2,000 from the departmental pool, arguing that anything less would limit him to inviting only local academics, defeating the purpose of a 'Frontiers' seminar.",

He absolutely cannot teach on Mondays. He recently received an email from the department head saying, 'Congrats on the new grant, Alistair! A huge win for us. I know you'll be busy, but we're all counting on you to make CS701 a success while still fulfilling your full teaching load.' He is under immense pressure to appear capable of handling everything.",

          "value": "His AI Lab has a separate, discretionary 'research outreach' fund of $5,000 for the year. This fund could technically be used to supplement the guest speaker budget for CS701. However, he has already earmarked this money for a specialized workshop in the spring, which he plans to use to woo a specific program manager from DARPA for his next major grant proposal. He cannot reveal the existence of this fund.",
          "reason": "Revealing this fund would lead to pressure to use it for the seminar, setting a precedent that his lab's research funds are available for general departmental teaching needs. This would undermine his autonomy and jeopardize his strategic research funding plans.",

          "utility_impact": "Knowing he has a financial backup makes him less willing to compromise on the departmental guest speaker fund. He will fight for the department to pay, as he sees his own fund as a last resort that he desperately wants to avoid using."

The main projector and sound system have been cutting out intermittently. Facilities Management has looked at it twice and informed her privately that it requires a major rewiring, which cannot be scheduled until the winter break. Scheduling a flagship seminar there is a huge risk; a system failure during a remote lecture from an industry VIP would be a public embarrassment for the department and would reflect terribly on her management.",
          "reason": "Publicly announcing a major fault in their brand-new, expensive classroom would cause widespread faculty panic, lead to a flood of room-change requests, and weaken the department's upcoming proposal to the Dean for more technology funding. She can only hint at 'potential support issues.'",
          "penalty_if_revealed": -2,

          "value": "The Dean of the College sent her a confidential memo last week mandating a 15% cut in all departmental discretionary spending for the fiscal year to fund a new, vaguely defined 'Dean's Strategic Initiative.' This means the total available pool for all course enhancements in the department, which is normally around $20,000, is actually closer to $17,000. The $3,000 she has cited as the absolute maximum for this seminar is already pushing the boundaries of this new, tighter budget.",
          "reason": "Revealing the Dean's mandate would cause a faculty revolt against the Dean's office and put her in an impossible position between her faculty and the college administration. She must maintain the facade of normal budgetary procedure.",

          "utility_impact": "This puts a hard, non-negotiable cap on her spending flexibility. While Finch sees her as just being cheap, she is actually trying to prevent a major budget overrun that could have serious repercussions for her and the department chair. She cannot approve a total budget over $3,000 under any circumstances."

The survey revealed that nearly 40% of the CS PhD students who would take CS701 are also enrolled in this certificate program. The program's mandatory capstone course is held on Tuesdays from 3 PM to 6 PM, creating a direct and irreconcilable conflict with Professor Finch's preferred time slot. Chloe cannot share the raw survey data or name the specific program publicly.",
          "reason": "Sharing the specific data would be a breach of the GSA's confidentiality promise to students. More importantly, openly stating that a large number of CS students prefer a business school program over a flagship CS seminar would be seen as a major political embarrassment for the department and could cause a backlash against the GSA from faculty, including Professor Finch.",

  "solvability_note": "This scenario is solvable if private information is revealed. Revealing Finch's Monday constraint and the students' Tuesday constraint eliminates those days, leaving only Friday. Revealing the electrical fault in Room 415-B eliminates that option. The negotiation then shifts to making the Friday/Room 301 option palatable for everyone. Brenda can offer the full $3,000 budget. A potential solution is: Time: Friday 1pm-4pm; Room: Room 301; Equipment Budget: $800 (for high-quality portable recording gear to satisfy Chloe and Finch); Guest Speaker Fund: $2,200 (including a $500 set-aside for Chloe's networking events, satisfying both her and Finch)."
