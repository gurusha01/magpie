      "description": "A 30-year veteran of the utility industry, Eleanor is pragmatic, risk-averse, and primarily focused on maintaining grid stability and DPL's profitability. Her responsibility is to the grid's reliability and her shareholders. She views rapid, large-scale changes as inherently risky.",

        "Transmission Route Selection": {
          "description": "Eleanor strongly advocates for 'Route A'. While it is the most expensive option at $1.2B due to challenging terrain, it bypasses densely populated areas and is located in a corridor with historically low instances of extreme weather events. She argues that long-term reliability is worth the upfront investment. Utility: +2 for Route A, -1 for Route B ($1.0B), -2 for Route C ($800M).",
          "utility_impact": "This is her highest priority. Grid failure is her worst nightmare, both professionally and for the public. She will argue passionately that prioritizing cost over safety is a mistake that will cost far more in the long run."

        "Cost-Sharing Model": {
          "description": "Eleanor proposes a cost-sharing model where the financial burden is distributed. Her ideal split for the project is 40% government (REC), 30% utility (DPL), and 30% shared by the primary beneficiaries (Renewable Developers/Industry). She will frame this as a fair public-private partnership. Utility: +1 for any model where DPL pays \u2264 35%, -1 where DPL pays 36-45%, -2 where DPL pays > 45%.",
          "utility_impact": "Protecting DPL's financial health is a core part of her job. She needs to demonstrate to her board that this project is a sound investment, not a financial drain."

        "Phased Renewable Integration": {
          "description": "She insists on a cautious, phased approach to integrating renewable energy. She proposes an initial integration of no more than 15% of the new line's capacity from renewables, with a gradual increase of 2% per year. This, she argues, allows DPL to manage grid frequency and stability without investing in expensive battery storage systems immediately. Utility: +2 for \u2264 15% initial integration, 0 for 16-25%, -2 for > 25%.",
          "utility_impact": "She believes high penetration of intermittent renewables without massive investment in storage is a recipe for blackouts. She will use technical jargon to defend this position, emphasizing the need for 'system inertia' and 'voltage regulation'."

This substation lies directly on the proposed 'Route C'. The report, which she has on her encrypted laptop, states a 70% chance of catastrophic failure within 5 years from either a targeted cyber-attack or a Category-3 hurricane, which would cause a multi-state blackout for weeks. Sharing this specific report would trigger a federal investigation, cause public panic, and DPL's stock would collapse. Penalty: -2 for revealing the existence of 'Project Nightingale' or the specific substation vulnerability. -1 for vaguely alluding to 'unspecified, serious security concerns' regarding Route C.",
          "reason": "Revealing this information would cause mass panic, destroy public trust in DPL, and lead to immediate, crippling regulatory penalties and lawsuits. It is a career-ending, company-threatening secret.",

Her bonus is contingent on staying under this cap. Penalty: -1 for revealing the specific $400M cap, as it severely weakens her negotiating position on cost-sharing.",
          "reason": "Admitting to financial limitations would signal weakness to the regulator and other partners, inviting them to demand a larger contribution from DPL.",

This is due to 'QuantumLeap AI,' a massive tech firm, secretly planning to build three hyperscale data centers in the region. The current grid cannot support this, and failure to upgrade would mean losing the 5,000 high-paying jobs and billions in tax revenue. Penalty: -2 for revealing the company's name or the specific 25% demand figure. -1 for vaguely mentioning 'significant, classified future industrial demand'.",
          "reason": "The deal with QuantumLeap AI is under a strict NDA. A leak would kill the deal, causing a major economic and political disaster for the governor.",

However, the grant is strictly contingent on the finalized project plan including at least a 25% initial renewable energy integration and a guaranteed completion timeline of 5 years or less. Penalty: -1 for revealing the grant's existence too early. It's his ace in the hole, and revealing it prematurely weakens his ability to push others on cost and renewable targets.",
          "reason": "Using this as a negotiation tool too early would show his hand. He wants the other parties to commit to his goals *before* he solves their budget problems with it.",
          "utility_impact": "This grant gives him hidden flexibility. He can act as if the $1B budget is a hard cap, but knows he can introduce the $300M to make a more expensive project (like Route A) feasible, but only if he gets his renewable and timeline goals met."

Admitting this would trigger lawsuits from current customers, destroy her company's reputation, and violate covenants on her existing loans. Penalty: -2 for revealing the specific defect and 15% figure. -1 for admitting to 'minor potential for summer performance variability'.",
          "reason": "This is fraud. Admitting it would bankrupt the company and could lead to legal charges. She is desperate to hide it.",
