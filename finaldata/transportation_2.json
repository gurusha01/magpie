Understanding the critical medical needs from Coach Frank and Dr. Sharma makes the Munich stop and the on-board medical zone non-negotiable priorities. This information would lead the group to discard Isabelle's preferred airline (which likely can't accommodate the custom needs) and Liam's budget option. The optimal solution becomes a customized private charter flight. A charter can meet the specific schedule (Coach Frank), have a custom medical area (Dr. Sharma), allow for sponsor filming (Maria), provide extra space (Dr. Sharma), and be more cost-effective than booking 75 business class seats, thus satisfying David's real budget. Liam can broker this deal, forgoing his commission or loss-avoidance schemes for a standard, respectable profit."
