  "scenario": "Hurricane Cormorant Aftermath: Port Blossom Relief Coordination",
  "task": "A Category 4 hurricane, 'Cormorant,' has devastated the coastal state of Caladia, with the major hub of Port Blossom being the most affected area. Power is out, communication is sporadic, and the main port is partially blocked. Five key stakeholders must negotiate and agree upon a unified 'Port Blossom First 72-Hour Relief & Logistics Plan.' This plan must detail resource allocation, command structure, distribution priorities, and budget assignments for the critical initial response phase. The negotiation takes place in a makeshift command center with limited time and immense pressure to act.",

          "description": "Insists on a clear command structure where FEMA leads the coordination of all major logistical assets, including airlifts and heavy equipment. She argues this is essential for operational efficiency and to prevent duplicated efforts. She wants final sign-off on any resource deployment plan costing over $500,000. Utility: +2 if FEMA has final authority, -1 for a co-command structure with the state, -2 if a private or NGO entity is given primary logistical control.",
          "utility_impact": "This preference is central to her operational doctrine. A clear chain of command prevents chaos. A loss of federal control could lead to a disorganized response, which would reflect poorly on her and the agency, potentially endangering lives and wasting taxpayer money."

She is willing to negotiate the *timing* of the payment but not the 25% figure itself. Utility: +2 for a signed 25% agreement, +1 for 20%, -1 for 15%, -2 for any agreement below 15%.",

          "value": "During a previous flood response operation, Marcus Thorne went directly to the media to criticize FEMA's 'slow' response, which Anya felt was a political stunt that ignored logistical realities. She considers him a political opportunist who prioritizes optics over effective management. She privately believes he is incompetent to manage a large-scale distribution effort. Leaking this personal animosity would be highly unprofessional and undermine the entire collaborative effort. Penalty for revealing: -2.",
          "reason": "Maintaining professional decorum is paramount for a federal officer. Airing personal grievances would poison the negotiation and damage inter-agency relationships.",

Her current supervisor sent her a confidential email stating, 'Anya, this is your operation to prove yourself. A clean, under-budget response in Port Blossom will guarantee you the promotion. Avoid any negative press at all costs.' Revealing this would expose her motivations as career-driven rather than purely humanitarian. Penalty for revealing: -2.",
          "reason": "Revealing personal career ambitions in the midst of a disaster would damage her reputation as a dedicated public servant.",

He argues his teams have unparalleled local knowledge of roads, communities, and vulnerable populations. Utility: +2 if CEMA has sole control, 0 for a joint FEMA-CEMA operation, -2 if FEMA or an NGO takes the lead.",

He frames this as 'stabilizing economic centers'. Utility: +2 if these two are the top priority, -1 if they are treated equally with others, -2 if they are deprioritized.",

Utility: +2 if waived completely, -1 if reduced to 10%, -2 if held at 25%.",

This index identifies the low-income 'The Marshes' neighborhood and two specific migrant worker camps as the highest-need areas due to poor infrastructure and lack of resources. Utility: +2 if these areas are designated Priority 1, -1 if they are treated equally, -2 if they are deprioritized for political/economic zones.",

Knowing David's (SwiftHaul) crane is damaged, the group could agree to pay his premium for priority use of the functioning equipment while routing other aid via airlift, a role FEMA wants. Knowing Elena's (GAI) food is delayed, Marcus (CEMA) could handle initial food distribution using state resources in exchange for GAI focusing its earmarked funds on the migrant camps he was planning to ignore. The conflicting priorities can be woven into a functional compromise once the hidden constraints are understood."
