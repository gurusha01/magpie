A recent news report exposed alarmingly high student loan default rates, causing investor panic and attracting unwanted attention from government regulators.

  "task": "The six agents must negotiate and unanimously agree on the terms of a new 'Risk Mitigation & Platform Sustainability Framework.' This framework must be documented and signed by all parties. The negotiation must define three key pillars: 1) The Risk-Sharing Model: The exact percentage of default liability shared between investors, universities, and the platform itself. 2) The Data Transparency Protocol: The specific student and university data points that will be made available to investors. 3) The Platform Fee Structure: A revised fee model that can fund the new risk measures and ensure the platform's survival.",
