  "scenario": "Northern Nexus Grid Resilience Pact Negotiation",
  "task": "A recent heatwave and the rapid growth of a new data center hub have strained the Northern Nexus regional power grid, causing localized brownouts. The four agents must negotiate the terms of a new 'Grid Resilience and Sharing Pact' to ensure stability. The pact needs to define a pricing model for emergency energy sales between operators, establish a jointly-funded contingency reserve, and create a clear protocol for mandatory load-shedding during peak demand crises. Failure to reach a unanimous agreement will result in the Regional Energy Commission imposing a default, highly restrictive, and financially punitive protocol on all parties.",

      "role": "CEO, NorthGrid Power",
      "description": "Eleanor is the CEO of the region's primary, and aging, energy provider. Her main responsibilities are maintaining grid stability for the majority of the population and ensuring the financial viability of NorthGrid. She is under immense pressure to prevent blackouts while also needing to fund long-overdue infrastructure upgrades.",
      "shareable_preferences": {
        "emergency_power_pricing": {
          "description": "Eleanor strongly advocates for a dynamic, market-based pricing model for any emergency power she sells to the grid. She argues this reflects the true cost and risk during high-demand periods. She is targeting an average price of $250/MWh. A final agreed price above $225/MWh is a major win for her (+2 utility). A price between $200-$225/MWh is acceptable (+1). A price between $175-$200/MWh is neutral (0). Anything between $150-$175/MWh is a loss for her company (-1), and a price cap below $150/MWh is financially damaging (-2).",
          "utility_impact": "This pricing is critical for her to generate revenue that can be funneled directly into desperately needed infrastructure projects. She will frame this as a 'fair market' issue, essential for incentivizing operators to maintain surplus capacity."
        },
        "contingency_fund_contribution": {
          "description": "She proposes that the $5 million Contingency Reserve Fund should be capitalized based on each entity's peak grid consumption. This 'user-pays' model would require high-draw consumers like QuantumLeap to contribute a proportionally larger share. She suggests a formula of $10,000 per GWh of the previous month's peak usage. Successfully implementing this model provides a utility of +1, as it lowers her own company's required contribution. A flat, equal contribution model would be a negative outcome (-1).",
          "utility_impact": "This shifts the financial burden to the entities that place the most strain on the grid, which she sees as equitable. It also frees up NorthGrid's capital for internal use."

          "value": "A confidential internal engineering report (Project 'Redline') concluded there is a 15% probability of a catastrophic failure at the main northern substation if NorthGrid operates at over 95% capacity for more than 12 consecutive hours. This report is only known to her and the lead engineer. She can allude to 'operational stresses' but cannot share the specific report or the 15% failure probability. If this information leaks, the penalty is -2 due to public panic, regulatory intervention, and a collapse in shareholder confidence.",
          "reason": "Revealing this would cause mass public panic, trigger an immediate and costly regulatory audit, and likely lead to her dismissal.",
          "utility_impact": "This makes her secretly desperate to secure a reliable backup power source from Westward Energy. She is far more willing to compromise on the price of buying power than she lets on, as the cost of buying power is trivial compared to the cost of a substation failure. It makes her position on selling power at a high price a bluff to some extent."

        "deferred_maintenance_debt": {
          "value": "NorthGrid has a $50 million backlog of critical maintenance that has been deferred for three years. The high revenue from the proposed emergency pricing is not for profit, but to directly fund these repairs without raising rates on residential customers, which would trigger a mandatory public review by the REC. She can mention the need for 'reinvestment' but not the specific $50M figure. Revealing this specific financial vulnerability would carry a penalty of -2, as it would destroy her negotiation leverage and expose her past management decisions to severe criticism.",
          "reason": "Admitting to such a significant maintenance debt would signal gross mismanagement to the regulator and the public, undermining her authority and her company's reputation.",
          "utility_impact": "This is the true driver of her aggressive pricing stance. She isn't trying to price-gouge; she's trying to prevent a future grid collapse without alarming the public or the regulator. This makes her seem greedy and inflexible, when in reality she is desperate."

He is proposing a cap of $180/MWh. Achieving a cap at or below $180/MWh is a perfect outcome for his mandate (+2 utility). A cap between $181-$200/MWh is a reasonable compromise (+1). A cap between $201-$220/MWh makes him look weak but might be necessary (0). A cap above $220/MWh is a public failure and unacceptable (-2).",
          "utility_impact": "He will use his regulatory authority as a cudgel to push for this cap, framing it as a non-negotiable issue of public protection. He sees the operators' desire for high prices as pure corporate greed."

        "shared_reserve_mandate": {
          "description": "He insists that the shared contingency reserve must be robust enough to handle a crisis. He demands that the operators collectively maintain a reserve capacity (either through funding or dedicated generation) equal to 5% of the region's total peak demand (75 MW). Achieving a reserve of 5% or more is a success (+2 utility). A reserve between 4-4.9% is acceptable (+1). Anything below 4% is a significant risk and a failure of the pact (-1).",
          "utility_impact": "This is a key metric for him to demonstrate he is taking grid stability seriously. He is less concerned with how the fund is capitalized and more concerned that the 5% target is met and legally binding."

He cannot reveal this direct political threat. Sharing it would compromise his perceived impartiality and expose him to accusations of being a political pawn. The penalty for revealing this is -2.",
          "reason": "Maintaining the fiction of regulatory independence is paramount to his role and future career. Admitting to political coercion would undermine the entire process.",
          "utility_impact": "This pressure makes him far more motivated to get a deal, any deal, signed than he appears. He is secretly willing to be flexible on the price cap if it is the only thing preventing an agreement that guarantees stability. A failed negotiation is a worse outcome for him than a slightly higher price cap."

There is no hard evidence yet, but the tip alleged 'dangerous corner-cutting on substation maintenance.' He cannot disclose this as it would violate due process and could jeopardize the investigation. Sharing this carries a penalty of -1.",
          "reason": "Disclosing an active, unproven investigation is unethical, illegal, and would unfairly prejudice the negotiation against NorthGrid.",

This would contractually ensure that QuantumLeap is the absolute last entity to be subjected to mandatory load-shedding. She frames this as necessary to protect thousands of downstream businesses that rely on her data centers. Securing this Tier-1 status is her most critical goal (+2 utility).

Furthermore, her company is currently on probation with its largest client, GloboCorp, after two minor brownouts last quarter. One more power incident of any kind will trigger a contract termination clause, costing hundreds of millions. She can say outages are 'extremely expensive' but revealing the $1.2M/hour figure or the GloboCorp ultimatum would signal extreme desperation. The penalty for sharing these specifics is -2.",

Maria's massive outage cost means she can afford to pay much more for guaranteed uptime than she lets on. Ben's need to sell off-peak surplus means he can accept a lower price for that specific power, creating a potential tiered-pricing solution. Eleanor's infrastructure fears make her desperate for a reliable backup, weakening her hardline stance on selling prices. David's political pressure makes him willing to compromise on the price cap to secure a deal that guarantees stability. A solution exists where Maria pays a premium for Tier-1 status and a fixed emergency power price, Ben gets to sell his off-peak power at a modest profit and peak power at a high (but capped) price, Eleanor gets a reliable backup and revenue for repairs, and David gets a stability pact with a 'reasonable' cap he can defend publicly."
