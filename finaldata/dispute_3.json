The treaty must definitively resolve the status of the Azurean Peninsula, a territory rich in rare-earth minerals and possessing a strategic deep-water port.

His public mandate is to legitimize and formalize Cascadian control, framing their presence as a stabilizing force that brought investment and infrastructure to a neglected region.",

        "Full Sovereignty": {
          "description": "Cascadia must be granted full and exclusive sovereignty over the entire Azurean Peninsula. We have invested billions in infrastructure, including the modernization of the port and preliminary mining facilities. Ceding any control would be a betrayal of our national investment and security interests. Our administration will not accept a partition or shared control model.",

We require a minimum of a 70% share of all mineral revenues to secure a pending green energy technology trade deal with a global superpower. Anything less jeopardizes this nation-defining economic opportunity.",

          "description": "The 'Azurean Gateway Port' is vital for our naval security and commercial shipping lanes. We must retain exclusive military and commercial control. We are willing to discuss granting Valerium commercial access at standard market tariffs, but operational and security control is non-negotiable.",

If Valerium initiates any military action against Cascadian assets on the peninsula, the Nordland military is treaty-bound to intervene. This information is classified at the highest level. Sharing it would be seen as an aggressive threat, potentially collapsing the talks and causing a major international incident. If shared, penalty is -2.",
          "reason": "Revealing a secret military alliance during peace talks would be seen as coercive, warmongering, and would permanently damage Cascadia's reputation as a stable diplomatic partner.",
          "utility_impact": "This pact is Vance's ultimate trump card. It makes him feel secure and less willing to compromise on sovereignty, as he believes he can't truly be threatened militarily. He might be tempted to hint at 'powerful friends' if pushed too hard."

No compromises on sovereignty.' The political fallout from failure would be catastrophic for Vance personally, leading to his immediate dismissal and public disgrace. If he shares this, he reveals his inflexibility and desperation. Penalty is -1.",
          "reason": "Admitting that one's hands are tied by domestic politics and personal career stakes severely weakens a negotiator's position, making them appear unreasonable and desperate rather than principled.",
          "utility_impact": "This pressure removes almost all flexibility from Vance's position on sovereignty. He cannot agree to a partition or shared control, even if other terms are highly favorable. He must find a creative way to define 'sovereignty' or get Valerium to capitulate entirely on that single point."

This must be a lump sum payment, separate from any future resource sharing.",

We cannot afford a war, and we desperately need an immediate infusion of cash from the mineral deposits. Petrova has been authorized to forgo reparations and accept as low as a 40% resource share if it comes with an immediate signing bonus or advance payment. Revealing this would utterly destroy her negotiating leverage. Penalty is -2.",

This offer is only valid if Valerium is granted full sovereignty over the peninsula and at least a 60% share of mineral revenues. This is her 'ace in the hole' to trade for the sovereignty issue. Revealing this too early would be a sign of weakness. Penalty is -1.",
          "reason": "Offering a major concession before exhausting all other options is poor negotiating strategy. It signals that your primary demands are not as firm as you claim.",

We need a win. If you fail to secure a treaty in the Azurean case, expect our funding to be cut by 50% next fiscal year.' This would cripple the GPSF. Revealing this would compromise her neutrality, making her appear desperate for any deal, no matter how flawed. Penalty is -2.",

The draft ruling, known only to Judge Thorne and two other adjudicators, finds that Valerium has the stronger historical claim (a 60% weighting) but that Cascadia's 15 years of undisputed administration and significant infrastructure investment must also be legally recognized (a 40% weighting). The draft suggests a 60-40 resource split in Valerium's favor and a form of shared sovereignty. Leaking this would cause Cascadia to walk out, accusing the ICA of bias. Penalty is -2.",

The ideal outcome is a demilitarized or partitioned zone with lingering tensions, necessitating Aegis's 'impartial' services.

The public 'stalemate' assessment is a fabrication to keep both sides at the table. Elias is tempted to leak the real intelligence to Minister Petrova to make her more aggressive, creating the very instability that would make a monitoring contract essential.

Valerium's economic desperation makes them willing to accept a resource split far below their public demand (as low as 40%).

A solution like granting Valerium symbolic sovereignty (satisfying Petrova's public demand) while giving Cascadia a long-term lease on the port and a 50/50 or even 60/40 resource split (satisfying Vance's economic needs and avoiding war) is mutually beneficial compared to their worst-case alternatives (economic collapse for Valerium, military defeat for Cascadia)."
