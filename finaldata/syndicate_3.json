The goal is to negotiate and finalize a binding Term Sheet for the joint venture. This Term Sheet must define the capital contributions, equity splits, project scope, development timeline, and governance structure for the multi-phase, mixed-use development project.

      "name": "Marcus Thorne",
      "role": "Legacy Developer & Land Owner",
      "description": "Marcus is a 65-year-old, third-generation developer from Thorne Development. His firm owns 'The Foundry' site outright. He is known for high-quality, traditional luxury residential towers. He sees this project as his legacy and is deeply emotionally invested. His primary contribution to the syndicate is the land itself.",

        "Land Valuation and Equity": {
          "description": "Marcus firmly believes the land is worth at least $60 million and is contributing it to the syndicate in exchange for equity. He is targeting a 30% equity stake, reflecting this valuation and his role as the project visionary. He will be extremely unhappy with any valuation below $55M (which would equate to a ~27.5% stake) and considers a valuation below $50M a complete non-starter. A valuation of $60M or more (+2 utility) is his goal, $55M is neutral (0 utility), $52M is very disappointing (-1 utility), and below $50M is a deal-breaker (-2 utility).",
          "utility_impact": "This is Marcus's primary point of leverage. He will anchor the negotiation around a high land value, arguing that without his contribution, there is no project. He will be resistant to any independent appraisals that suggest a lower value."
        },
        "Project Scope and Vision": {
          "description": "He envisions 'The Thorne Tower,' a signature 50-story luxury condominium building, as the project's centerpiece, complemented by high-end retail. He wants to use his established architectural and construction partners. He is strongly against what he calls 'trendy, unproven' sustainable technologies or 'socially-engineered' mixed-income housing. A project centered on his vision is a +2 utility. A project that significantly incorporates ESG or affordable housing elements is a -1 utility. A project that abandons the luxury tower concept is a -2 utility.",
          "utility_impact": "He will push for aesthetic control and the use of his trusted, albeit expensive, partners. He sees this as a matter of brand integrity and ensuring a 'timeless' quality that will justify premium pricing."
        },
        "Development Timeline": {
          "description": "Marcus prefers a slow, meticulous, single-phase 48-month development timeline to ensure the highest quality and to allow the market to mature. He finds rushed timelines sloppy and detrimental to a luxury brand. A 48-month timeline is ideal (+2 utility). A 36-month timeline is an acceptable compromise (0 utility). A timeline under 30 months is considered reckless and unacceptable (-2 utility).",
          "utility_impact": "He will argue that quality cannot be rushed and will use his experience to cast doubt on the feasibility of faster timelines proposed by others."

          "value": "Marcus's official, private appraisal from a trusted firm valued the land at only $48 million. He has an email from his appraiser with the subject 'CONFIDENTIAL: 'The Foundry' Parcel Appraisal - Final Valuation' clearly stating this number. He knows he is inflating the value by 25%. Sharing the real appraisal would severely weaken his negotiating position and damage his reputation for integrity. Penalty for hinting at a lower value: -1. Penalty for revealing the $48M figure: -2.",
          "reason": "Revealing this would expose him as negotiating in bad faith and would drastically reduce his equity stake, costing him millions.",
          "utility_impact": "This makes him highly defensive about the land value. He might overcompensate by being overly aggressive or dismissive of others' valuation estimates, creating friction. He is terrified of being asked to produce his appraisal report."

She wants her firm to oversee construction and technology integration. Securing this role with clear authority is a +2 utility. Being a 'co-manager' with Marcus is acceptable (0 utility). Being relegated to a consultant role is a -2 utility.",

        "Development Methodology": {
          "description": "She proposes a phased, 30-month development timeline. Phase 1 would be a mid-rise residential building with co-working spaces, designed to generate revenue quickly. This would be followed by the main tower. A 30-month phased approach is ideal (+2 utility). A single-phase 36-month timeline is a reluctant compromise (-1 utility). Marcus's 48-month plan is a deal-breaker (-2 utility) as it's antithetical to her firm's entire model.",

She needs to either secure a firm commitment on 'The Foundry' syndicate within a week or walk away. She cannot reveal this deadline as it would give the other parties immense leverage to squeeze her on terms, knowing she's desperate for a quick decision. Penalty for revealing she has another offer: -1. Penalty for revealing the hard 10-day deadline: -2.",
          "reason": "Revealing a hard deadline signals desperation and gives the other side leverage to wait her out or offer her worse terms.",
          "utility_impact": "This hidden time pressure will make her seem pushy or impatient. She might be tempted to make concessions on other points (like equity) just to get the deal signed quickly, but she must mask the reason for her urgency."

        "Capital Stack Structure": {
          "description": "David requires a conservative capital structure with a maximum 50% Loan-to-Cost (LTC) ratio. This means at least 50% of the project cost must be funded with equity. He is willing to contribute up to $150 million in equity, but only in a 'preferred equity' position, meaning he gets paid back first. A 50% LTC with his preferred equity position is ideal (+2 utility). A 60% LTC is the absolute maximum he can consider (-1 utility). Anything higher is a violation of his fund's mandate (-2 utility).",
          "utility_impact": "He acts as the financial brake on the deal. He will demand exhaustive financial models and will be the most skeptical of optimistic revenue projections."

          "description": "He insists on a significant pre-leasing/pre-sale requirement for the residential and commercial spaces, demanding at least 40% of units/space be committed before construction on the main tower begins. This de-risks the project significantly. Achieving 40% pre-sales is a +2 utility. 30% is a compromise (0 utility). Below 25% is unacceptable (-2 utility).",

They are now under a strict internal mandate to only invest in 'Core' or 'Core-Plus' assets (low-risk, stable, completed properties). A ground-up development like this is technically 'Opportunistic' and outside his mandate. He has special, one-time permission from his CIO to pursue this deal because of its prime location, but he received an email from the CIO saying, 'David, don't make me regret this. If the risk profile on this ticks up even slightly, we are out.' He cannot share this as it would reveal his position is precarious and that his capital is not as guaranteed as he claims. Penalty for revealing the mandate issue: -2.",
          "reason": "Admitting his fund is bending its own rules would cause the other partners to question his commitment and the stability of his funding, potentially collapsing the deal.",

          "description": "Javi's fund is targeting a minimum 25% project-level IRR. To achieve this, he needs a fast timeline (24-30 months) and a quick exit (selling the asset within 5 years of completion). A 24-month timeline that models a >25% IRR is a +2 utility. A 30-month timeline is acceptable (0 utility). A 36-month timeline makes the IRR borderline (-1 utility), and a 48-month timeline makes the deal unworkable for his fund (-2 utility).",

          "description": "To boost returns, Javi insists on maximizing leverage. He wants a 70% Loan-to-Cost (LTC) financing structure. He has relationships with aggressive lenders who can provide this. A 70% LTC is his goal (+2 utility). He can live with 65% (0 utility), but a 60% LTC severely hurts his return profile (-1 utility), and David's proposed 50% is a non-starter (-2 utility).",

Javi is under immense pressure to deliver a quick, high-profile 'win' with this deal to show positive momentum for their upcoming fundraising round. He recently received a congratulatory email from his boss after securing this negotiation, which ended with 'PS: Don't mess this up. We need a 25% IRR on the board by Q3 next year.' Revealing this pressure would signal weakness and allow others to dismiss his aggressive tactics as desperation. Penalty for revealing this: -2.",
          "reason": "Admitting his fund is in trouble would cripple his negotiating leverage and reputation. In the cutthroat world of PE, perception is reality.",
          "utility_impact": "This pressure makes Javi's focus on IRR and speed non-negotiable. He may come across as arrogant or myopic, unable to see value beyond his financial model.

This is a non-negotiable mandate from his fund's charter. Achieving LEED Platinum is a +2 utility. LEED Gold is a disappointing compromise (-1 utility). Anything less is a deal-breaker (-2 utility). These features are estimated to add 8-10% to the total project cost.",

A 15% affordable housing component is his goal (+2 utility). 10% is an acceptable compromise (0 utility). Less than 5% is a failure of his mission (-2 utility).",

More importantly, he is driven by a deep-seated need to prove to his uncle Marcus that his modern, ESG-focused approach to development is not just 'hippie nonsense' but is financially superior and more relevant than Marcus's traditional methods. He once had a huge fight with Marcus who told him he would 'run his father's company into the ground.'

For instance, Marcus's actual land value ($48M) is much closer to what other parties would deem fair, allowing for a more reasonable equity split. Chloe's urgency for a quick deal means she might be flexible on her equity share in exchange for speed and the 'Development Manager' title. Javi's need for a 'win' might make him accept a slightly lower IRR if the deal closes fast and looks good on paper. David can be convinced if the additional cost of Aris's ESG features is offset by a stronger overall financial model and risk profile. The core conflict can be resolved through a compromise: a land valuation around $50-52M, a 36-month phased timeline, a 60% LTC, and a hybrid project scope that incorporates both luxury and LEED-certified elements."
