  "scenario": "The Starlight Foundation's annual gala features a high-stakes auction for the sole, original handwritten manuscript of 'The Crimson Hourglass,' the final, unpublished novel by the recently deceased and beloved author, Evelyn Reed. The auction takes an unconventional turn: instead of a simple highest-bid-wins, the top three bidders, whose final silent bids were extremely close, are brought into a private negotiation room. They must collectively decide who takes ownership of the manuscript and how their combined final donation will be structured. The foundation's goal is to maximize the total donation while ensuring a positive public narrative.",
  "task": "The three agents must negotiate and produce a single, signed agreement that definitively outlines: 1. The sole new owner of the Evelyn Reed manuscript. 2. The total final donation amount to the Starlight Foundation. 3. The specific monetary contribution of each of the three agents towards that total donation. The negotiation takes place over a 60-minute period in a private suite at the gala.",

Julian, unable to afford the manuscript, could be offered private, supervised viewing sessions before it's transferred to the university, in exchange for his contribution to the donation pool. This allows Marcus his PR win and digital content, Eleanor to fulfill her promise to the university, and Julian to have the personal connection he craves, all while maximizing the total donation."
