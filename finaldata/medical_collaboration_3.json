Thorne's hidden failures make him more amenable to Cole's long safety trials. Petrova's hidden legal risk makes Thorne's research a crucial backup, pushing her towards a joint IP deal. Cole's hidden resource limits mean a more focused, targeted oversight plan (which the others would now welcome given their own hidden risks) is more practical than his initial broad demand. A compromise involving an 18-month timeline, a joint IP agreement with commercial exclusivity for BioGen, and a fully-funded auditor satisfies the core needs of all three parties."
