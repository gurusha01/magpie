Two competing transplant centers, the prestigious Metro Health and the ambitious Summit Regional, have top-priority patients who are both viable matches.

Utility: +1 if the transplant is successful and can be used as a positive case study, -1 if the case results in complications or negative publicity.",

This isn't just a 'good' heart; it's a 'once-a-year' heart. She can publicly state it is 'high quality' but is prohibited by OPO protocol from sharing the specific DRI score to prevent it from being treated like a commodity. Penalty for sharing the exact DRI score: -1.",

A potential solution could be allocating the heart to Mr. Evans due to the superior medical match, but with a strict, advocate-monitored post-op compliance plan.
