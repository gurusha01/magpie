He argues that a high price will stifle innovation and economic growth. His ideal price is at or below $25 per ton. He can tolerate a price up to $35, but anything above $45 he considers punitive and unsustainable for his company's financial models. Utility Function: PCC <= $25 (+2); $26 <= PCC <= $35 (0); $36 <= PCC <= $45 (-1); PCC > $45 (-2).",

He is pushing for a high initial volume of available credits, ideally 1,500,000 tons or more. A smaller market (below 1,000,000 tons) creates scarcity and risk, which could jeopardize their expansion timeline.

He frames this as 'reducing red tape' and 'enabling rapid action'. He finds levels 5-6 acceptable but considers anything 7 or higher to be overly burdensome, costly, and slow, involving excessive audits and paperwork.
