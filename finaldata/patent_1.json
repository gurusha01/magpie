The revelation of TerraWatt's material degradation flaw and Helios's secret catalyst creates a clear path forward: a new deal where Helios contributes its catalyst IP for a larger ownership stake, and the joint R&D effort is focused on solving the degradation problem, which Lena Petrova is best equipped to lead. Kenji's knowledge of the flaw is corroborated, and his need for funding can be addressed as part of the now-critical manufacturing scale-up. The personal and institutional pressures (bonuses, job offers, budget cuts) become secondary factors that can be balanced once the primary technical and business hurdles are openly understood."
