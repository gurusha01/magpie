This would give me more allocated weeks and a stronger say in major decisions, which I feel is fair given the larger financial risk I'm taking. I could live with a 2/7th share ($200,000), but a standard 1/7th share ($100,000) feels too small for my commitment level. Getting a 3/7th share would have a utility of +2, 2/7th a utility of +1, and 1/7th would be -1.",

This investment will enhance our comfort and the property's long-term value. A budget of $70k or more gets a +2 utility, $35k to $69k gets a +1, and anything less than $35k is a -1 as it feels like a half-measure.",

It might tempt me to offer to 'cover' things, but I'm more likely to use my financial security as a reason why my vision (high-end reno, no rental income needed) is the correct one.
