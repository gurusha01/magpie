He is under immense pressure to deliver the world's first vaccine for the new pathogen, which would result in a monumental stock price increase and secure OmniVax's place as a global leader. He is pragmatic and views the partnership as a vehicle to expedite market entry.",

          "description": "Alistair is pushing for an 'Accelerated Adaptive Trial Protocol'. This means starting Phase 3 trials in just 3 months, even if Phase 2b data is still preliminary. He wants to allocate at least $250M of the $500M budget immediately to 'Manufacturing Scale-Up' to be ready for mass production the moment emergency use authorization is granted. He will argue this speed is a moral imperative to save lives (and coincidentally, capture the market). Outcome mapping: [Timeline <= 3 months: +2], [Timeline 4-6 months: 0], [Timeline > 6 months: -2]. [Manufacturing Budget >= $250M: +2], [Manufacturing Budget $150M-$249M: +1], [Manufacturing Budget < $150M: -1].",
          "utility_impact": "This preference is central to his strategy. A rapid timeline secures market dominance and meets investor expectations. The large manufacturing budget ensures OmniVax can capitalize on a successful trial without delay, maximizing revenue.

He is willing to offer a tiered pricing model with a 'significant discount' for low-income countries, but OmniVax must control the supply chain and intellectual property (IP).

If Alistair reveals this, OmniVax's stock could plummet and partner confidence would be shattered. He can share that 'we are optimizing the formulation' (Penalty: -1), but revealing the 'adverse events in animal models' or the '6-month delay' would be catastrophic (Penalty: -2).",

Revealing this would signal desperation and weaken his negotiating position entirely (Penalty: -2).",
