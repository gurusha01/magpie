The plan must cover all personnel and equipment transport for a 6-week shoot, balancing a tight budget, specific location requirements, crew safety, and local regulations.

He will scrutinize every line item, from vehicle types to fuel costs and driver overtime. Getting this number as low as possible is his top priority. A deal at $250k is good (+1), under $230k is excellent (+2), at $300k is neutral (0), and anything over $300k is a failure (-1 to -2).",

Liam has been tasked by the executive producer to absorb this cost quietly across other departments. His *actual*, secret budget for transportation is now only $220,000. Revealing that the overall film budget is in trouble would cause widespread panic and severely damage his reputation as a competent manager, likely costing him a planned promotion to Head of Production. He can hint at 'general budgetary pressures' (penalty: -0.5), but revealing the specific $150k figure is a disaster (penalty: -2).",

This is confidential, of course. Well done on the Morocco leg.' He is highly motivated to achieve this. Sharing this information would make him appear greedy and self-serving to the rest of the team, destroying trust. (penalty: -2).",
          "reason": "Socially unacceptable to discuss personal financial incentives during a team negotiation. It would undermine his authority and perceived commitment to the project's quality.",

Sofia is hoping to use the leverage of a fully-booked production to renegotiate this clause with the authorities later.

She cannot share this as it's confidential industry gossip and would be highly unprofessional, but it makes her push for a quick decision. (penalty: -1).",

If the negotiation drags on and the surcharge becomes public, Liam will demand the price be based on the old cost structure, and Ben will lose a significant portion of his intended profit.
