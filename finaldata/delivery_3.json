This information is confidential because the Veridian government is sensitive about foreign entities dictating internal distribution and could block the entire shipment if they found out.

It is secure but will add exactly $50,000 to her operational costs (fuel, security). Revealing the compromised bridge upfront would destroy her price leverage, as Aris would know a fast delivery requires the more expensive route.

Her true all-inclusive cost for this job using the necessary Mountain Route is $140,000. To get a 25% margin, she needs a contract price of at least $175,000.

This high price allows Isabelle to use the more expensive but faster 'Mountain Route' (costing her $140k) and make a significant profit, securing her bonus. The fast route and quick clearance meet Aris's timeline needs. Aris can justify the high cost by getting Javi's required multi-point distribution, which secretly satisfies his donor mandate. Javi gets the specific supplies he needs delivered to the exact locations required to overcome his logistical shortfalls and serve the most vulnerable populations."
