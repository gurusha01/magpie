His primary concerns are maintaining a high quality of service for existing critical business systems (ERP, CRM) and managing a notoriously tight budget. He is pragmatic and cost-conscious, often seen as the gatekeeper against expensive, unproven technologies.",

David's goal is to keep the increase, driven by the InsightPrime launch, to an absolute minimum. He is aiming for no more than a 10% increase ($50,000), bringing the total to $550,000. An increase above 15% ($575,000) would be considered a major failure and require him to cut costs elsewhere.",

A low-cost solution makes him look efficient and fiscally responsible to upper management. (+2 if total cost <= $525k, +1 if <= $550k, -1 if between $551k-$575k, -2 if > $575k)."

This project will require a sustained 1 Gbps of internal network bandwidth. This is not public knowledge, and the CFO has explicitly told him not to factor it into any official budget requests yet to avoid premature scrutiny from the board. If he reveals this, it would be a major breach of trust with the CFO.",

He cannot justify the full 4 Gbps with public data, making his position seem overly conservative. Penalty for revealing 'Project Chimera' is -2."

Revealing Sarah's insurance constraint establishes her security demands as non-negotiable business requirements. Revealing Maria's technical issue explains why the expensive tier is the only viable option. Revealing David's hidden project justifies his need for a large bandwidth reserve. With this clarity, the agents can negotiate a solution: they must choose the 'Guaranteed QoS' tier. To manage the cost, Maria can offer a significant discount in exchange for a 3-year contract to meet her quota. David, understanding the immense risk of being uninsured, can then justify a budget increase that exceeds his bonus target, prioritizing company safety over personal gain. This allows for a policy that meets all technical and security requirements within a newly justified budget."
