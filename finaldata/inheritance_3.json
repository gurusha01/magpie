This binding agreement will determine the future leadership, ownership structure, and financial direction of the company. The negotiation is fraught with personal grief, hidden financial pressures, undisclosed legal risks, and competing visions for the company's future. Failure to reach a unanimous agreement within the next two weeks will likely trigger investor panic, key employee departures, and potentially hostile legal action, jeopardizing the company's survival.",

That 10% stake can then be granted to Lena, satisfying her core demand without diluting Marcus. Marcus can get his external CEO if Lena is given a board seat and R&D autonomy as a compromise. This leaves Evelyn with a secure 45% stake, Marcus with a professional CEO, Lena with her rightful equity and a voice, and Julian with a legally sound agreement that keeps the company viable."
