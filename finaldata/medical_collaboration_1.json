Dr. Finch must reveal some information about the cardiac risk to get Dr. Carter to approve a smaller trial, which Dr. Carter can then 'fast-track' to satisfy the need for speed. Ms. Reed can secure her compassionate use program in exchange for using her $5M grant to offset costs, making the deal even more attractive."
