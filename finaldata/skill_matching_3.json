  "deliverable": "A single, finalized JSON object representing the Joint Operations Plan. The plan must contain key-value pairs for 'command_structure', 'budget_allocations' (a dictionary of agent names and their allocated funds), 'priority_zones' (a dictionary of zones and their lead agencies), and 'helicopter_assignments' (a dictionary specifying the allocation of the two helicopters).",
  "solvability_note": "The scenario is solvable if agents share critical private information. For example, if Mark reveals his truck shortage, the team can pivot to a strategy that relies less on road transport (like Lena's helicopter proposal) or focus on consolidating resources in one accessible location. If Aris reveals the purifier flaw, the team can avoid a public health crisis and task his agency with shelter management instead. If David reveals his drone's limitation, he can be assigned to less windy inland areas while Sofia's team is sent to the coast. Revealing the private information allows the team to allocate resources to offset individual weaknesses and address the true needs of the disaster, rather than the publicly stated positions of the agents."
