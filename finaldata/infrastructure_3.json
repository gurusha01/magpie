Lena's soil report and Maria's funding contingency both make Route B impossible. This forces the negotiation towards Route C. Ben's private need for a ~ $414M+ budget on Route C to stay solvent, combined with Lena's legal injunction threat (making the low-displacement Route C the only option), forces Maria to find a way to increase the city's contribution slightly above her public preference to secure the deal. A potential solution is: Route C, a budget of $415M (Maria accepts a minor political hit on budget, Ben gets his profit), a 4-year timeline (a compromise), and a generous compensation package for the <25 displaced homes (a win for Lena)."
