The team must agree on three critical, interconnected variables: 1) The official global launch quarter, 2) The final budget allocation for their respective departments from the remaining project funds, and 3) The final go/no-go decision on including the 'Level 3 Aetherion Pilot' autonomous driving feature. The current plan, which is proving contentious, targets a Q4 2024 launch with the Aetherion Pilot as a headline feature.",

The combined knowledge of the testing failure and the impending battery regulation makes the business case for allocating David's $5M and part of Elena's $20M request ($15M for new sensors) clear and logical. A mutually agreeable solution would be a Q2 2025 launch, with a budget allocation of +$15M for Design, +$5M for Regulatory, and the remaining contingency used to offset production costs, and launching with a fully functional Aetherion Pilot."
