The negotiation involves allocating a limited budget, determining staffing levels for doctors and nurses, approving or denying capital expenditures, and setting policies for overtime and work hours. The core conflict stems from the administration's mandate to cut costs versus the medical staff's need for more resources to handle an anticipated, but not fully disclosed, surge in patients.",

The cost of a major patient care failure (lawsuits, reputation damage) due to understaffing during the surge would be far greater than the cost of new hires and would certainly trigger the bond downgrade Mark fears. This forces Mark to reconsider his hardline stance. Simultaneously, knowing the financial pressure allows the medical staff to propose more cost-effective solutions, like Sarah's software and cross-training program, as a compromise to secure the most critical new hires. The burnout data reinforces the urgency, making investment in staff a clear risk-mitigation strategy for the entire group."
