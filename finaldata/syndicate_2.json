    "Term Sheet Agreement": "All five parties must agree to and sign a final term sheet.",

  "deliverable": "A single, comprehensive investment term sheet document outlining all the agreed-upon terms, ready for signature by all parties.",
  "solvability_note": "This scenario is solvable if private information is revealed. Aris's hidden side-effect data and Marcus's suspicions would force a more realistic, milestone-based approach to de-risk the science, justifying a compromise on valuation. Ben's desperation for a pipeline asset and Lena's knowledge of the patent's weakness create a strong incentive for them to form a mutually beneficial IP deal (e.g., OmniPharma pays a solid upfront fee that Lena needs, in exchange for favorable acquisition terms and dropping any future patent challenge). Isabelle's need for a 'win' makes her more agreeable to a structured deal that looks good to her LPs, even if the headline valuation is higher than she wanted. The revealed pressures and risks create a clear Zone of Possible Agreement for a complex but logical deal structure."
