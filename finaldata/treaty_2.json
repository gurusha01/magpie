This is my primary, non-negotiable objective.

This creates a perfect opening for Dr. Halvorsen's 'Isotopic Sniffer' technology as a compromise, which they can both accept to protect their secrets. The high cost of this technology ($5B total fund) can be justified as it solves their primary security concerns. A 50/50 split of the $5B fund can be framed by Volkov as a 'win' on principle, while Sharma can justify the cost by achieving her critical budget-saving warhead limit."
