  "task": "Three competing companies in the autonomous commercial drone sector are meeting to establish a new trade association. The goal is to agree on a foundational charter that will define the association's purpose, structure, and rules for the next three years. The negotiation must result in a unanimous agreement on four key pillars: the Membership Fee Structure, the Intellectual Property (IP) Sharing Policy, the Governance Model (Voting Rights), and the Primary Association Mandate.",

      "name": "Eleanor Vance",
      "role": "CEO of AeroVanguard Inc.",
      "description": "Eleanor leads the industry's largest and most established company, AeroVanguard. Her company holds a dominant market share (around 60%) with its line of heavy-duty, long-range drones used in logistics and industrial inspection. She sees the association as a tool to solidify her company's market leadership, create high barriers to entry, and steer industry regulations in a direction that favors AeroVanguard's existing technology stack.",
      "shareable_preferences": {
        "Membership Fee Structure": {
          "description": "Eleanor strongly advocates for a high, flat annual membership fee of $150,000 for all members. She will publicly argue that this ensures only 'serious, committed companies' with long-term vision can join, thus maintaining the association's prestige and influence. A fee below $100,000 feels too low and would dilute the association's power. She is willing to accept a fee between $100k-$149k, but with reluctance.",
          "utility_impact": "A flat fee of $150k gives a utility of +2. A fee between $100k and $149k provides +1. A fee between $50k and $99k is neutral (0). Any tiered structure or a flat fee below $50k results in a utility of -2, as she believes it would allow 'unserious startups' to disrupt her strategic goals for the association."
        },
        "Intellectual Property (IP) Policy": {
          "description": "She insists on a 'RAND (Reasonable and Non-Discriminatory)' licensing policy for any patents deemed essential to association standards. This would require members to license their core patents to others for a fair price. Since AeroVanguard holds the majority of foundational patents in the industry, this policy would create a significant, steady revenue stream for her company and force competitors to pay for using the established technology.",
          "utility_impact": "A strong RAND policy is a +2 utility. A weaker version where licensing fees are capped is a +1. A Royalty-Free (RF) policy where essential patents must be shared without cost is a catastrophic -2, as it would completely devalue her company's primary asset."
        },
        "Primary Association Mandate": {
          "description": "Eleanor wants the association's primary focus (at least 60% of the budget and resources) to be on government lobbying, specifically targeting the FAA. Her goal is to shape upcoming federal regulations to require stringent, expensive certification processes that AeroVanguard's drones already pass, but which would be prohibitively costly for smaller competitors.",
          "utility_impact": "A mandate with >60% budget for lobbying is +2. 40-60% is +1. A mandate focused on R&D standards or marketing is -1, and if lobbying is allocated less than 20% of the budget, it's a -2."

        "Project Chimera Secrecy": {
          "value": "AeroVanguard is secretly developing 'Project Chimera,' a next-generation drone that uses a completely new, highly efficient but proprietary battery technology. This project is 18 months from market. If the association adopts standards based on current lithium-ion battery interoperability, it would make Project Chimera's launch more difficult and less impactful. Therefore, she wants to delay any battery-related standardization for at least two years. She cannot reveal Project Chimera because it would alert competitors to her R&D direction and tank the stock price of her key battery supplier. Leaking the project's existence carries a -2 utility penalty.",
          "reason": "Revealing a secret, market-disrupting product violates fiduciary duty to shareholders and would give competitors a critical 18-month head start on developing countermeasures.",
          "utility_impact": "This secret information is the primary driver for her push for a lobbying-focused mandate. By controlling regulations, she can subtly shape them to favor her upcoming, unannounced technology without having to reveal its nature."
        },
        "Flagship Product Flaw": {
          "value": "An internal audit last month discovered a minor software vulnerability in the navigation system of their flagship 'AV-Guardian' drone fleet. A fix is developed but will take 6 months to deploy across all active units. If a competitor discovered this, they could launch a smear campaign about safety and reliability. She recently received a confidential memo from her engineering chief stating, 'Any forced interoperability standard with third-party software before Q3 next year could expose the 'Guardian' vulnerability.' Sharing any detail of this would be catastrophic. Penalty: -2.",
          "reason": "Admitting a product flaw in a safety-critical industry would lead to immediate loss of contracts, a stock price collapse, and potential regulatory investigations.",
          "utility_impact": "This makes her extremely resistant to any mandate focused on open R&D standards or immediate software interoperability. She will frame her opposition as 'protecting industry security and stability' rather than revealing the true, defensive reason."

      "role": "Founder & CTO of Synapse Robotics",
      "description": "Ben is a brilliant engineer who founded Synapse Robotics, a fast-growing startup specializing in AI-driven drone software and lightweight, agile hardware. His company thrives on innovation and open-source principles. He sees the association as a way to level the playing field, break up AeroVanguard's quasi-monopoly, and accelerate industry-wide technological adoption through open standards.",

He argues this is the only fair way to allow innovative startups, which are the lifeblood of the industry, to participate and contribute. A flat fee is fundamentally unfair and anti-competitive.",
          "utility_impact": "His proposed tiered structure is +2. Any tiered structure is at least +1. A flat fee below $50k is neutral (0). A flat fee above $100k, like Eleanor's proposal, is a -2 as it would effectively exclude his company and others like it."

        "Intellectual Property (IP) Policy": {
          "description": "Ben is a fervent advocate for a Royalty-Free (RF) licensing model for all foundational standards, especially communication protocols and basic navigation APIs. He believes this will foster rapid innovation, interoperability, and grow the entire market, which benefits everyone. He argues that RAND policies stifle innovation by letting incumbents 'tax' new entrants.",
          "utility_impact": "A full Royalty-Free policy for core standards provides a utility of +2. A policy that is mostly RF with some minor exceptions is +1. A RAND policy is a -2, as it would force him to pay his biggest competitor just to be compliant with industry standards."
        },
        "Governance Model": {
          "description": "Ben insists on a 'one company, one vote' governance model. He believes that allowing voting power to be proportional to company size or fees paid would enable AeroVanguard to unilaterally dictate the association's direction. He wants a democratic structure to ensure all voices are heard equally.",
          "utility_impact": "A 'one company, one vote' model is a +2. Any model that gives disproportionate power to larger companies is a -2. A compromise, like a board with designated seats for different company sizes, is a -1."

This technology makes drone fleets exponentially more efficient and resilient. He just received a congratulatory email from his lead investor: 'Ben, the SwarmAI patents are approved! This is the moat we needed. Once we launch in 8 months, we'll be untouchable. Your bonus is locked in.' If he reveals the existence of these patents, AeroVanguard will immediately pivot its R&D to create a competing system or design standards that intentionally exclude his technology. The penalty for revealing this is -2.",
          "reason": "Revealing a pending, game-changing technology before product launch is corporate suicide. It erases the first-mover advantage and invites incumbents to crush you.",
          "utility_impact": "This is the hidden reason for his aggressive push for a Royalty-Free IP policy and an R&D-focused mandate. He wants to make SwarmAI the free, open standard, which would cement his company as the industry's technological leader and make their software indispensable, without having to fight AeroVanguard's existing patent mountain."

They are being squeezed by AeroVanguard's scale and Synapse's innovation. Sofia needs the association to provide legitimacy, reduce marketing costs, and open up new markets for her company to survive and grow.",

She wants at least 50% of the budget allocated to promoting the safety, reliability, and economic benefits of commercial drones to the public and potential enterprise clients. She believes a rising tide will lift all boats, and a better public image is the most pressing issue for the entire industry.",
          "utility_impact": "A mandate with >50% budget for joint marketing is +2. 30-50% is +1. A mandate focused entirely on lobbying or R&D standards is -1, and if marketing is given less than 20% of the budget, it's a -2."

          "description": "Sofia is caught in the middle. She cannot afford Eleanor's high flat fee, but she also doesn't want the association to be flooded with tiny startups that Ben's proposal would allow. She proposes a moderate flat fee for all members, somewhere between $40,000 and $60,000. She believes this is a fair price for the value a well-run association would provide.",
          "utility_impact": "A flat fee between $40k-$60k is +2. A tiered system with her company in a ~$50k bracket is +1. A flat fee above $75k is -2, as her CFO would never approve it. A fee below $25k is -1, as she fears it would not generate enough revenue for the marketing activities she deems essential."

          "description": "Sofia strongly pushes for the association to prioritize aligning its standards with the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) rather than just the US-based FAA. She argues that Europe is the next big growth market and having a unified, international standard will be critical for global competitiveness.",

They are the final bidder on a massive, company-saving contract with a European agricultural conglomerate. A key clause in the contract requires adherence to standards set by a recognized industry association. The endorsement from a newly formed ACDA would guarantee them the contract, which is worth $20M. If she reveals this financial desperation, her negotiating leverage would evaporate, and the others might impose terms she cannot meet. Penalty for revealing the crisis: -2.",
          "reason": "Admitting financial instability is a sign of weakness that can scare off customers, spook investors, and embolden competitors during negotiations.",
          "utility_impact": "This desperation is why the joint marketing (for legitimacy) and EASA alignment (for the contract) are non-negotiable for her.

Knowing about Eleanor's product flaw and secret project explains her resistance to open standards and desire to control regulations. Knowing about Sofia's financial desperation and her crucial European contract explains her focus on marketing and EASA. A potential solution exists: a tiered fee structure that meets budget constraints; a hybrid IP policy that grandfathers in old tech under RAND but designates future communication standards (like SwarmAI) as Royalty-Free; a 'one company, one vote' model for governance; and a balanced mandate with budget for lobbying (Eleanor), R&D working groups (Ben), and joint marketing with a committee for international standards (Sofia)."
