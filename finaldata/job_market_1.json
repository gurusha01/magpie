She wants to build a team of at least 20 engineers in the first 18 months and wants direct input on the product roadmap.",
          "utility_impact": "Full autonomy is critical. If she gets to define her team's charter and has budgetary control, she is very happy (+2). If the role is constrained by existing bureaucracy or she has to report to someone other than the CEO, she is very unhappy (-2)."

A project with high-risk, high-reward potential is far more appealing than a safe, incremental role. She would secretly accept a lower salary for a chance to work on a truly revolutionary project. She would rate QuantumLeap's project a '9/10' for legacy potential and Innovate's a '6/10'.",
          "reason": "Revealing that she's driven by legacy more than money would severely weaken her salary negotiating position. It makes her seem less financially motivated and easier to low-ball.",

          "utility_impact": "This hidden constraint heavily influences her decision-making. Any deal that meets the signing bonus requirement provides a hidden +1.5 utility boost for the peace of mind it brings. Failure to secure this bonus makes any deal a failure, regardless of other terms."
