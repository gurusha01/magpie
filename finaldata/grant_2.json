It would also justify the full $5M budget, as funds would be needed to investigate and mitigate this side effect. Dr. Reed's conflict of interest would be exposed, but a neutral party would see that funding a highly effective (though risky) therapy is a good use of foundation money, provided the risks are managed. The optimal solution is to approve the full $5M budget, but mandate an 18-month trial delay for further preclinical safety work specifically targeting the neurological issue, overseen by a fully empowered DSMB as Dr. Petrova demands."
