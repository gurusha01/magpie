Seraphina's need for personal time and Leo's need for a 'no intimacy' clause are compatible. The publicists' conflicting strategies can be resolved by blending them: Chloe gets the initial high-brow exclusive, while Julian gets to stage his viral 'kiss-cam' moments later in the relationship. Awareness of the managers' and lawyer's personal pressures would explain their urgency and rigidity, allowing for more empathetic and targeted compromises."
