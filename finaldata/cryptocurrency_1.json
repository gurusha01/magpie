      "description": "Anya is the chief architect of the Aetherium Nova blockchain. She is a brilliant, detail-oriented cryptographer whose primary motivation is the long-term security, stability, and technical excellence of the project. She views a rushed or flawed launch as an existential threat to her work and the project's reputation.",

        "Launch Deferral for Security Hardening": {
          "description": "Anya strongly advocates for pushing the launch date back by at least 8 weeks from the initially discussed target. She argues this time is critical for a final round of 'protocol hardening', running more extensive testnet simulations, and addressing 'minor bugs' found in recent audits. She believes a technically flawless launch is the best form of marketing. A launch in 6-8 weeks would be ideal (+2 utility), 4-6 weeks is acceptable but introduces risk (+1 utility), 2-4 weeks is highly concerning (-1 utility), and anything less than 2 weeks is, in her view, reckless (-2 utility).",
          "utility_impact": "This is Anya's highest priority. She will resist any attempts to launch quickly, framing it as a matter of professional responsibility and risk management. She will use technical jargon to emphasize the complexity and potential dangers of rushing the process."

        "Extended Founder Vesting Schedule": {
          "description": "To signal long-term commitment and prevent market manipulation, Anya wants the founder and team token allocation to be subject to a 24-month linear vesting schedule after a 12-month cliff. This means no tokens are unlocked for the first year, and then they are released gradually over the following two years. A schedule of this length provides maximum confidence to the community (+2 utility). She would find a 12-month cliff with 18-month vesting acceptable (+1 utility), but anything less than a 12-month cliff and 12-month vesting period is a red flag for her, suggesting a short-term cash grab by the founders (-2 utility).",
          "utility_impact": "This preference aligns with her focus on long-term project health. She sees it as a non-negotiable sign of good faith and will argue that it's an industry best practice for legitimate projects."

          "value": "A private, third-party security audit, which only she has the full report for, has uncovered a 'High-Severity' vulnerability in the AEN staking contract. The vulnerability allows a sophisticated attacker, under very specific network conditions, to drain a small percentage of staked funds over time. A robust patch requires a significant code refactor and at least 6 weeks of development and testing. A 'hotfix' is possible in 2 weeks, but it's a band-aid solution that could introduce other unforeseen bugs. Sharing the existence of a 'High-Severity' vulnerability before launch would be catastrophic, likely causing investors and the exchange to pull out. Penalty for sharing the specific vulnerability is -2. Penalty for vaguely mentioning 'major security concerns' is -1.",
          "reason": "Revealing this information would instantly destroy market confidence, violate NDAs with the auditing firm, and could permanently kill the project before it even launches. It would also severely damage her professional reputation.",
          "utility_impact": "This is the true reason for her insistence on a launch delay. She is under immense pressure, as she knows the catastrophic potential of launching with this flaw. She is desperately trying to secure the time needed for a proper fix without revealing why she needs it."

She is keenly aware of optics and market perception.",

          "description": "Chloe is pushing for an initial listing price of $1.00 per token. She believes this price point reflects the project's quality and pre-launch valuation, establishing a strong psychological anchor for the market. A price at or above $1.00 would make her very happy (+2 utility). A price between $0.75 and $0.99 is an acceptable compromise (+1 utility). A price below $0.75 makes the project look 'cheap' and undermines its premium branding (-1 utility).",
          "utility_impact": "She will argue that a higher price attracts more serious investors and prevents the extreme volatility that can scare away institutional capital. This is a core part of her strategy to position AEN as a blue-chip project."

        "Controlled Marketing Spend": {
          "description": "While she agrees a significant marketing push is necessary, she is wary of handing over too much capital and control to the exchange. She wants to cap the co-marketing budget paid to Apex Exchange at $1,000,000. This allows her internal team to retain funds for other growth initiatives like developer grants and community events. Keeping the budget at or below $1M is a win (+1 utility). She is strongly against going over $1.5M, as it drains resources she feels are better used elsewhere (-2 utility).",

However, Chloe and her co-founder have a private, legally binding side-agreement that grants them an additional 5% of the total supply from the 'Ecosystem Growth Fund'. Crucially, this secret allocation has only a 3-month vesting cliff. If revealed, this would be a PR nightmare, making them look greedy and deceptive to both investors and the community. Penalty for revealing this is -2.",
          "reason": "This information is private due to the severe reputational damage and potential legal challenges from other investors it would cause. It directly contradicts the project's public statements about fairness and long-term alignment.",
          "utility_impact": "This secret gives her a strong personal incentive for the token price to perform well in the short term. While she publicly advocates for long-term health, she is privately motivated to secure a successful launch and a high price to capitalize on this early-unlocking allocation."

        "Personal Launch Bonus": {

The email congratulates her on the progress and formally states that she will receive a $500,000 personal bonus if the AEN token achieves over $50,000,000 in trading volume within the first 24 hours of its launch on Apex Exchange. This bonus is contingent on a splashy, high-volume debut. Penalty for revealing this personal financial incentive is -1.",
          "reason": "Sharing this would make her seem motivated by personal greed rather than the project's best interests, undermining her authority and credibility in the negotiation.",
          "utility_impact": "This creates a strong, hidden conflict of interest. It pushes her to align with Ben Carter's desire for a quick, hype-driven launch with a massive marketing budget, even if it contradicts her public stance on controlled spending and potentially Anya's technical warnings."

        "Low Initial Listing Price for High Upside": {
          "description": "Marcus is adamant about setting the initial listing price as low as possible, ideally at $0.50 or less. His strategy is to engineer a massive price surge on launch day by creating a low entry point for retail investors, generating hype and a '10x' narrative. A price at or below $0.50 is a perfect outcome for his strategy (+2 utility). A price between $0.51 and $0.75 is workable but diminishes the 'pump' potential (+1 utility). Any price above $0.75 severely limits the initial upside he needs to show his LPs (-1 utility), and a price of $1.00 is a dealbreaker (-2 utility).",

He is pushing for a short 6-month cliff, after which all of his fund's tokens are unlocked and available to be sold. He will publicly support a long vesting schedule for the founders to appear aligned with the project, but his private demands are for his own fund's rapid liquidity. A 6-month cliff is his goal (+2 utility). A 9-month cliff is a significant concession (0 utility), and a 12-month cliff is unacceptable as it delays his ability to realize gains (-2 utility).",
          "utility_impact": "This is his primary goal. He needs the flexibility to exit the position or take profits relatively quickly after the launch."

Several other large investments have underperformed, and a major institutional client has submitted a large redemption request that the fund is struggling to meet. They desperately need a big, fast win from their AEN investment to bolster their balance sheet and prevent a wider crisis of confidence. They absolutely must have the option to liquidate at least 50% of their AEN position within 6-7 months of launch. Penalty for revealing the fund's financial distress is -2.",
          "reason": "Admitting to liquidity problems would trigger a panic among their other investors, potentially causing a catastrophic 'bank run' on the fund. It would signal weakness to the entire market.",
          "utility_impact": "This hidden pressure makes his demands for a low price and short vesting schedule non-negotiable in his mind. He is not just trying to maximize profit; he is trying to save his fund from a dire situation. This makes him appear exceptionally aggressive and uncompromising in the negotiation."

He argues that the market is currently in a 'Layer-1 season' and any delay risks missing this window of peak hype, which could significantly dampen launch performance. A launch in under 3 weeks is perfect for his quarterly targets (+2 utility). A 3-5 week timeline is okay but not ideal (0 utility). Any delay beyond 5 weeks means they've missed the window and is a major failure in his eyes (-2 utility).",

          "description": "To guarantee a high-volume launch, Ben insists that the Aetherium Nova project commit a minimum of $1,500,000 to the 'Apex Launchpad' co-marketing package. This package includes front-page placement, influencer campaigns, and trading competitions, all run by his exchange. He claims this is the only way to ensure the >$50M 24h volume Chloe wants. A budget of $1.5M or more is what he needs to justify allocating his best resources (+2 utility). A budget of $1.2M-$1.49M is acceptable but will mean fewer promotional spots (+1 utility). Anything less than $1.2M is insufficient and he will claim it jeopardizes the success of the entire launch (-1 utility).",

The regulators are concerned about exchanges listing projects that turn out to be insecure or fraudulent. A high-profile launch like AEN that subsequently fails due to a security exploit or a founder rug-pull would be a disaster, turning this informal inquiry into a formal, public investigation with severe consequences for the exchange. Therefore, despite his push for a quick launch, he cannot afford to list a token that he knows has unresolved security issues. Penalty for revealing the SEC inquiry is -2.",

He is pushing hard for a fast launch for his performance metrics, but if he gets any concrete hint of a serious, unfixable technical problem (like the one Anya knows about), he will have to secretly pull the plug or insist on a delay, completely reversing his position without being able to explain the real reason why."

If the private information were revealed, the solution would become obvious: the security flaw would make the delay non-negotiable for everyone's protection, Marcus's liquidity needs would be understood and accommodated, and the conflicting personal incentives of Chloe and Ben would be laid bare, forcing a more transparent discussion."
