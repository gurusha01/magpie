The conflict between David (wants >$52) and Marcus (wants <$52) can be resolved by Ben, who is willing to pay up to $53.50 for a quick deal. A potential solution is a split allocation between the two aggressive buyers at a price they can both tolerate. For example: a price of $52.75, with Marcus taking 3M shares and Ben taking 2M shares, settled in 24 hours. This meets David's price, Sarah's deadline, and gives both Marcus and Ben a significant position within their acceptable price ranges and timelines."
