  "task": "Four agents must negotiate and agree on the terms of a joint patent application and subsequent commercialization strategy for a promising new Alzheimer's drug, 'NeuroClear'. They need to produce a signed Term Sheet that defines patent ownership, financial compensation (upfront payment, milestones, royalties), and the timeline for filing. The negotiation is complicated by undisclosed clinical data, severe financial pressures, competing corporate interests, and confidential regulatory intelligence.",

      "role": "Lead Academic Researcher, University of Northwood",
      "description": "A brilliant neuroscientist who led the foundational research for NeuroClear in her university lab. Her primary motivation is scientific integrity, the public good, and securing long-term funding for non-commercial, curiosity-driven research. She feels a deep ethical responsibility for the drug's safe development.",
      "shareable_preferences": {
        "Ethical Oversight and Data Integrity": {
          "description": "Anya insists on a 'Scientific Integrity Clause' in the agreement. This clause would grant her and the university's ethics board the right to review all future clinical trial designs and halt any trial if they believe patient safety is compromised or data is being manipulated. She is adamant that the final patent filing must be delayed until she can run a small, 6-week confirmatory study on a potential anomaly she observed. A 6-week delay is her ideal (+2), a 3-week delay is acceptable (+1), no delay is highly undesirable (-1), and being contractually blocked from oversight is a deal-breaker (-2).",
          "utility_impact": "This preference is driven by her core scientific and ethical principles. She fears a large corporation might cut corners on safety to rush to market, and she wants the power to prevent that. This directly conflicts with the urgent timelines desired by other parties."

        "Public Research Reinvestment": {
          "description": "Anya wants a significant portion of the royalties from NeuroClear to be channeled into a new 'University of Northwood Fund for Foundational Neurological Research'. Her goal is to secure a royalty rate of at least 8% of net sales for this fund. Getting 8% or more would be a major victory (+2), 5-7% is a good outcome (+1), 3-4% is a disappointment (0), and anything less than the university-mandated minimum of 3% is unacceptable and would cause her to lose face with the university board (-2).",
          "utility_impact": "This isn't personal wealth; it's about her legacy and enabling future generations of scientists. She will trade other financial terms, like a lower upfront payment, to maximize this long-term, altruistic goal."

          "value": "In a small, non-essential animal study ancillary to the main research, Anya observed that 2 out of 10 subjects treated with a high dose of NeuroClear developed a specific cardiac arrhythmia. The data is statistically insignificant and may be an anomaly, but it worries her deeply. She has not shared this with anyone. She knows revealing this unconfirmed, 'dirty' data could scare off investors and partners, potentially killing the entire project and severely damaging her professional reputation as being alarmist. Penalty for revealing the specific data (cardiac arrhythmia): -2. Penalty for vaguely mentioning 'unforeseen safety signals' or 'the need for more toxicology work': -1.",
          "reason": "Revealing preliminary and potentially erroneous negative data could be career suicide, branding her as sloppy or unreliable. It would also violate university protocols about releasing unverified findings.",
          "utility_impact": "This is the true reason she is pushing so hard for the 6-week delay and the ethics oversight clause. She desperately needs time to replicate the finding without causing a panic. It makes her seem stubborn and overly cautious to the others."

      "description": "A driven and desperate entrepreneur. His small startup, Innovate Bio, licensed Anya's initial discovery from the university and invested heavily in refining the compound into the patentable drug, NeuroClear. The company is running out of money and this deal is its only path to survival.",

        "Substantial Upfront Payment": {
          "description": "Ben is pushing for a large, immediate cash injection to secure his company's future. He argues that Innovate Bio has borne all the risk and cost of pre-clinical development. He is demanding an upfront payment of at least $10 million. An outcome of $10M or more is a huge success (+2), $7M-$9.9M keeps the company healthy (+1), $5M-$6.9M is survival mode (0), and anything less than $5M means he will have to start laying off key staff, a devastating failure (-2).",
          "utility_impact": "This payment is non-negotiable for him, as it's the only way to guarantee his company's operational runway for the next 24 months. He will be aggressive on this point, even if it means compromising on long-term royalties."

This is critical for his company's valuation and for attracting future investment. He views this as a matter of corporate identity and credibility. Securing lead status is a major win (+1), co-equal status is neutral (0), and being listed as a secondary party is a significant blow to his company's prestige (-1).",

He just received an email from his CFO with the subject 'URGENT: Final Payroll Warning' detailing that they cannot meet the next quarter's payroll without this deal. Penalty for revealing the company is on the verge of bankruptcy: -2 (he loses all negotiating leverage and will be taken advantage of). Penalty for hinting at 'tight financial pressures' or 'investor timelines': -1.",
          "reason": "Admitting financial desperation would destroy his negotiating position. He needs to project an image of strength and having other options, even though he has none.",
          "utility_impact": "This makes him extremely time-sensitive and fixated on the upfront payment amount. He will agree to almost any other concession (lower royalties, less control) if his $5M+ upfront cash need is met quickly. This desperation makes him vulnerable."

          "value": "Unbeknownst to Anya, Ben's team created a slightly modified version of the NeuroClear compound (a different salt formulation) and filed a provisional patent on it two months ago. He did this as a 'plan B' to retain some IP if the deal with Anya's original compound fell through. This action is ethically questionable and likely violates the spirit, if not the letter, of his licensing agreement with the university. Penalty for revealing this: -2 (it would shatter the trust with Anya and the university, likely leading to a lawsuit).",
          "reason": "This is a breach of trust. Revealing it would make him appear duplicitous and could scuttle the entire negotiation and his relationship with the university.",
          "utility_impact": "This gives him a false sense of security and might make him overplay his hand. If he gets too frustrated, he might be tempted to allude to having 'other avenues for our technology', which could be a disastrous bluff."

She will propose an initial offer of a $1M upfront payment and a 3% royalty on net sales. A deal with total royalties under 5% is a huge win (+2), 5-7% is acceptable (+1), 8-10% is expensive (0), and over 10% is a poor outcome for PharmaCorp (-1). She wants any upfront payment to be under $2M.",
          "utility_impact": "Her goal is to conserve PharmaCorp's capital and mitigate risk. By pushing risk onto the sellers, she demonstrates fiscal responsibility to her board. This directly conflicts with Ben's need for a large upfront sum and Anya's desire for high research royalties."

This includes full control over all clinical trials, marketing, and pricing. She will not accept any external oversight, especially from an academic committee. Gaining full, unfettered control is a key objective (+2). Accepting minor reporting requirements is neutral (0). Agreeing to a clause like Anya's 'Scientific Integrity Clause' is highly undesirable (-2).",
          "utility_impact": "PharmaCorp's business model relies on complete control of its assets. Any external influence, especially one that could halt a multi-billion dollar development program, is seen as an unacceptable risk."

CogniBoost is less promising than NeuroClear but PharmaCorp has already invested over $150M in it. Her secret strategic goal is to acquire NeuroClear to either a) replace CogniBoost if it's clearly superior, or b) 'slow-walk' its development to give CogniBoost a chance to get to market first. Penalty for revealing the existence of CogniBoost: -2 (this could be seen as anti-competitive and would reveal her potential motive to sabotage NeuroClear).",
          "reason": "Revealing a competing internal project would expose PharmaCorp to accusations of anti-competitive behavior and signal to the sellers that she might not be negotiating in good faith to actually develop their drug.",
          "utility_impact": "This is why she is so insistent on total control and is fighting Anya's oversight clause. She needs the contractual freedom to delay or even shelve the project without repercussions. It also puts a cap on what she's willing to pay."

A congratulatory email from her manager reads 'Clara, close this under $25M and that $200k bonus is all yours. Make it happen.' This is a huge personal incentive. Penalty for revealing her personal bonus: -2 (highly unprofessional and would completely undermine her negotiating authority). Penalty for revealing her maximum authorized budget of $50M: -1.",
          "reason": "Personal financial incentives should never be part of a negotiation. Revealing this would make her look self-serving rather than acting in her company's best interest, and would tell the other side exactly where her 'pain point' is.",
          "utility_impact": "She will fight tooth and nail to keep the total valuation below $25M. This makes her seem incredibly stingy and unreasonable, as she is personally motivated to reject offers between $25M and her real max budget of $50M."

He argues that in the competitive landscape of Alzheimer's research, any delay creates a significant risk of being 'scooped' by a competitor. He will frame this as standard best practice. A filing within 30 days is ideal (+2), within 60 days is acceptable (0), and a delay beyond 90 days is, in his professional opinion, malpractice (-2).",
          "utility_impact": "A quick, successful filing is a major selling point for his consultancy. He wants to add 'Successfully fast-tracked NeuroClear patent' to his list of achievements. This puts him in direct opposition to Anya's request for a 6-week delay."

Complex clauses, like Anya's oversight committee or convoluted royalty splits, create potential future legal and regulatory headaches. He wants a straightforward licensing deal to one commercial partner (PharmaCorp) with clear, unambiguous terms. A simple agreement gets a +1 utility, while a complex one with multiple oversight clauses gets a -1 utility.",

His friend, after a couple of drinks, let slip that their main rival, 'GeneVantis Therapeutics', submitted a patent for a drug with a strikingly similar mechanism of action just last month and it has been granted fast-track review status. This means the 'window of opportunity' for NeuroClear is closing much faster than anyone else in the room realizes. Penalty for revealing the specific source or company name: -2 (this is an illegal leak of confidential government information and would end his career and possibly lead to prosecution). Penalty for stating definitively that a competitor has already filed: -1.",

  "solvability_note": "The scenario is solvable because a middle ground exists if private information is revealed. Knowing Ben's desperation and Clara's true budget ($50M) allows for an upfront payment (e.g., $6M) that saves Innovate Bio while being acceptable to PharmaCorp. Knowing about the competitor's filing (from David) and the side effect risk (from Anya) creates a shared incentive to compromise on a short, but not immediate, delay (e.g., 4 weeks) for confirmatory testing to strengthen the patent before the competitor gets too far ahead. A deal could be structured around a $6M upfront payment, an 8% royalty (split 4%/4% between the university fund and Innovate Bio), and a 4-week filing delay, which would satisfy the core needs of all parties."
