This satisfies the contract. 2) A main, public launch on a date like October 28th, just before the competitor and when the packaging is ready, marketed as the 'premium edition'. This allows Marketing to beat the competitor while giving Engineering just enough time to fix the critical module, potentially by de-scoping the smart lock feature to v1.1 and using Isabella's private knowledge to offer the hotel client a discount to keep them happy."
