Her public stance is that funds should be preserved for project development and ecosystem grants, not hefty exchange fees. She strongly advocates for a fee under $100,000 (+2). She can be pushed to accept up to $250,000 (0), but considers anything above $400,000 (-2) as predatory and a significant drain on her project's future.",
          "utility_impact": "A lower fee directly translates to a longer development runway for her team. She will argue that a successful project will bring ApexTrade far more in trading fees over time than a one-off listing payment."

          "description": "Instead of a high fee, Lena proposes a 'Partnership Model'. She wants ApexTrade to co-invest in a joint marketing campaign, with a combined budget of at least $500,000, where Nova Labs contributes up to $150,000. She believes a collaborative marketing effort will create a much larger and more sustainable launch. A strong joint campaign gets her a (+2) utility, while a standard, minimal marketing package from the exchange is a (-1).",
          "utility_impact": "This preference is a strategic move to leverage ApexTrade's brand and market reach, which she believes is more valuable than cash. It also frames the relationship as a long-term partnership rather than a simple transaction."

A listing fee over $250,000 would force her to either lay off key developers or sell a large portion of the team's AET allocation on a secondary market before the main listing, which would be a catastrophic signal. She has a printed email on her desk from her CFO, dated yesterday, with the subject 'URGENT: Q3 Runway Projections & Insolvency Risk' that details how any significant cash outlay before Q4 revenue streams are active could jeopardize the entire company. Sharing this would instantly destroy her negotiation leverage and cause a panic. Penalty for revealing specific financial distress: -2.",

She is legally bound by it but never disclosed it to other investors. She knows this is a ticking time bomb. Honoring it could be seen as preferential treatment, while breaking it could lead to a lawsuit from her biggest backer. Penalty for revealing the existence of the side-letter: -2.",
          "reason": "Admission of providing secret, preferential terms to one investor over others would destroy her credibility, enrage her community, and could have serious legal ramifications for securities fraud.",

He will frame this as a 'quality filter' to ensure projects are well-funded and serious. He can be negotiated down to $400,000 if other terms are highly favorable (+1), but his ideal outcome is the full $500,000 (+2). Anything below $300,000 is unacceptable (-2) as it sets a bad precedent.",

This is presented as a non-negotiable term to ensure a stable and orderly market for ApexTrade users. A fully compliant liquidity plan gets him (+2) utility. Any attempt to use a lesser-known market maker or provide less than $1.5M in liquidity is an immediate deal-breaker (-2).",
