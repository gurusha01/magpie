  "task": "A multi-agent negotiation to determine the fate of star basketball player Alex 'The Comet' Vance of the Metropolis Titans. Alex has a guaranteed 3-year, $60M contract but has been flagged for an 'anomalous' reading in a recent performance-enhancing drug (PED) test. The team wants to terminate his contract, citing a violation of the league's substance abuse policy. The Players' Union is fighting the termination, claiming the evidence is inconclusive. The agents must negotiate a binding resolution covering Alex's suspension length, the status of his contract, and any associated financial penalties.",

She argues that anything less sets a dangerous precedent for all players in the league. Utility: +2",
