They need to agree on a single 3-hour time slot for the meeting, which must take place between July 1st and July 12th. They also need to decide on the meeting location (company HQ boardroom vs. an off-site retreat) and finalize the priority order of the top three agenda items. Each executive has their own departmental goals, private commitments, and hidden priorities that influence their preferences, creating a complex negotiation landscape.",
