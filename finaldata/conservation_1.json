      "description": "A 55-year-old career civil servant with a doctorate in ecology. Aris is caught between his genuine commitment to conservation and intense political pressure from the Ministry of Economic Development to make protected areas financially self-sustaining. He must produce a 'balanced' outcome that satisfies national environmental laws while also generating revenue to prevent severe budget cuts to his agency. His reputation is built on being a pragmatic, data-driven negotiator.",

          "description": "Establish a 'Strict No-Go Zone' for all commercial activities. Publicly, Aris is pushing for 25,000 hectares (50% of the Grove) to meet ambitious national biodiversity targets and secure his legacy as a conservationist. He argues this is non-negotiable for preserving the Grove's most sensitive ecosystems. Utility is based on the size of this zone: 25,000+ ha (+2), 22,500-24,999 ha (+1), 20,000-22,499 ha (0), 17,500-19,999 ha (-1), <17,500 ha (-2).",
          "utility_impact": "Meeting this goal is crucial for Aris's professional standing and for satisfying international conservation agreements. He will use government data and legal mandates to heavily anchor the negotiation around this high number. Failure to secure at least the legal minimum of 20,000 ha would be a major political and personal failure."

          "description": "Mandate that any and all logging operations must achieve and maintain Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) certification. This is a public promise his agency has made and is a key part of their 'sustainable development' narrative. This is a binary preference. If FSC certification is explicitly included in the final agreement (+1), if not (-2).",
          "utility_impact": "This preference provides a shield against criticism from environmental NGOs. It allows him to concede to some logging while claiming it's the 'most responsible' kind. He will not agree to any plan that does not include this provision."

          "description": "Establish a fund for the Arawan community, financed by logging revenues. His opening public offer is a 5% share of gross revenues. He frames this as a generous offer from the government to ensure equitable benefit sharing. Utility based on the percentage: 3-5% (+1), 6-9% (0), 10-14% (-1), 15%+ (-2).",
          "utility_impact": "This position is designed to make the government look like a fair mediator. He expects to negotiate this figure upwards but wants to keep it below 10% to maximize the state's own share of the revenue, which is needed for his agency's budget."

The Minister has personally ordered Aris to ensure this specific area is NOT designated as a Strict No-Go Zone, so that 'future strategic resource assessments' can be conducted. He cannot reveal the reason, as it would cause a political firestorm and accusations of prioritizing mining over conservation. Sharing this information would result in immediate dismissal and a major scandal. Penalty: -10 (career-ending). Hinting at 'national strategic interests' in the area. Penalty: -1.",
          "reason": "Revealing state-classified information about strategic mineral resources would violate national security protocols, derail the negotiation, and end his career.",

He must steer the negotiation to keep that 5,000-hectare northern block open to access, perhaps by designating it as a 'buffer zone' or 'scientific research zone'. Any proposal that places this area under strict protection is a non-starter for him, forcing him to veto the entire plan.

The Mariposa Grove logging deal is the only viable path to achieving this. A 'no-deal' outcome guarantees the budget cut, which would mean laying off a third of his staff. He can mention 'budgetary considerations' but cannot reveal the exact figures or the dire consequences of failure. Sharing the specific $2M target and layoff threat. Penalty: -2.",

While he wants high conservation, a complete ban on logging is not an option for him.

The central area contains sacred sites (as she publicly states), but the southern area is key to their daily survival.

This creates immense pressure to secure a deal that includes a significant upfront 'signing bonus' or a high enough revenue share to fund the project within the first two years.

This allows them to allocate the northern zone for logging/special use, satisfying Aris's secret constraint and Marcus's need for a concession area, while allowing the more valuable southern and central areas to be allocated for conservation and indigenous protection, satisfying Lena's and Aris's primary goals. A smaller, but more valuable, logging zone in the north allows Marcus to meet his profitability targets while affording a higher revenue share for Lena."
