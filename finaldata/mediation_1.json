The negotiation involves determining a total monetary compensation amount for the 100-person plaintiff class, defining specific policy changes Innovate Inc. must implement, and agreeing on the language of any public statements and non-disclosure agreements. The goal is to produce a signed Term Sheet by the end of the two-day mediation period.",

An ideal outcome for her would be under $8 million, which she could present to the board as a major win. She will argue that any amount higher than $10M would negatively impact Q4 earnings and force layoffs in non-essential departments.",
          "utility_impact": "This is her primary metric for success. A settlement under $8M gets a utility of +2. Between $8M and $10M is acceptable (+1). Between $10M and $12M is neutral territory (0), but she will show significant resistance. Between $12M and $15M is a poor outcome (-1), and over $15M is a catastrophic failure in her eyes (-2)."

This is critical for investor relations and preventing future 'copycat' lawsuits.",

An external monitor or auditor is unacceptable as it implies the company cannot be trusted.",
          "utility_impact": "Full internal control over policy changes is a positive outcome (+1). Agreeing to a one-time external audit after 24 months is a concession she can live with (0).

She recently received an internal email from the CFO, which she could easily forward by 'mistake', stating: 'Eleanor, great news. The Project Chimera launch is outperforming all Q3 projections. We're looking at an extra $5M in unexpected profit this quarter alone. This should give you more flexibility in the mediation.'",

Sharing the news of the company's unexpected profits would invite significantly higher demands from the plaintiffs.",

This amount would give David his needed fee, provide a fair result for Anjali before her deadline, and allow Eleanor to hit her personal bonus target. The conflict will be over the non-monetary terms, where Sofia's private motivation may help bridge the gap between Marcus's desire for no oversight and Anjali's demand for transparency."
