Assigning him to this job, which I know is already facing a massive hidden delay, is likely to make him late, lose him his bonus, and severely damage his morale. My next best courier is 20% slower and has a lower customer satisfaction rating.",

I have deliberately not mentioned this because successfully delivering the *exact* model requested under a tight deadline is a much more powerful demonstration of our company's competence. Suggesting a substitute now would feel like an admission of failure before we've even begun.",
          "reason": "Proactively offering a substitute makes her company look unprepared and unable to fulfill a basic order. It's her secret 'get out of jail free' card if everything collapses, but using it prevents her from achieving the 'wow' factor needed to secure the larger contract.",

If Sarah reveals the split inventory, Ben reveals the route delay, and Maria reveals the 30-minute deadline buffer, they can devise a solution. A potential solution: Sarah initiates the $250 transfer. Ben dispatches Mike on a two-stop pickup using the longer, downtown route ($50 extra cost). The total time for the transfer and multi-stop pickup via the clear route will make the ETA approximately 4:25 PM. Maria can agree to this ETA, knowing it meets the client's real deadline, thus securing the future contract and achieving a successful outcome for all, albeit with some costs and compromises."
