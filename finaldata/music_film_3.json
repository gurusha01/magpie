      "description": "Chloe is the driven and meticulous executive producer for the TV series 'Neon Tides'. Her primary responsibility is to deliver a critically acclaimed and commercially successful show on time and on budget. The soundtrack is a crucial element for setting the show's tone, and she sees it as a major marketing driver. She answers to the studio executives who are watching the budget very closely.",

        "Soundtrack Budget": {
          "description": "I need to secure the entire soundtrack package\u2014including recording costs, artist advance, and marketing\u2014for under $500,000. This figure allows me to allocate resources to other crucial post-production areas like visual effects. Pushing the budget higher will require me to justify the expense to the studio and could jeopardize other aspects of the show's quality. My ideal outcome is a deal around $475,000.",
          "utility_impact": "Keeps the studio happy and protects my budget for other departments. A deal at <=$500k is a major success (+2). A deal between $501k-$575k is acceptable but requires compromises elsewhere (+1). A deal between $576k-$650k creates significant problems for me (0 to -1). Anything above $650k is impossible (-2)."
        },
        "Creative Oversight": {
          "description": "While I respect the artist's vision, the music must serve the story. I must retain the right of final approval on all master tracks to ensure they align with the tone and specific scenes of 'Neon Tides'. The show has a very specific 'dystopian synth-pop' aesthetic, and a song that deviates too far, no matter how good, is unusable. I am willing to provide detailed creative briefs for each musical cue.",
          "utility_impact": "This is non-negotiable for the show's integrity. Full final approval rights give me peace of mind (+2). A collaborative approval process where I have a 'tie-breaking' vote is workable (+1). The artist having full creative autonomy is a major risk and unacceptable (-2)."

        "Delivery Deadline": {
          "description": "The final, mixed, and mastered tracks for all songs must be delivered to our sound mixing department no later than October 1st. This deadline is critical to our post-production schedule to ensure the show is ready for its winter premiere. Any delay creates a domino effect of expensive rush jobs and overtime for my team.",
          "utility_impact": "Meeting the October 1st deadline is essential for a smooth workflow (+2). A delay of up to one week is manageable but stressful (0). A delay of more than one week would be a logistical and financial nightmare (-2)."

        "Promotional Support": {
          "description": "The artist's involvement is key to marketing the show to a wider audience. I need a firm commitment for the lead artist to participate in at least four major promotional events. This should include the official premiere, a feature on a major late-night talk show, a joint interview with the show's lead actor for a magazine, and a performance at the Comic-Con panel.",
          "utility_impact": "Getting four or more high-profile appearances would be a huge marketing win (+2). Securing three is good (+1). Getting only two is a disappointment (0). One or zero is a failure to leverage our main asset (-1 to -2)."

If I close the deal for under $550,000, I receive a $50,000 bonus. I can share that my budget is 'tight', but revealing the exact $650k ceiling would instantly evaporate my negotiating leverage. Revealing the existence of my personal bonus would make me look self-serving and damage my relationship with the other parties. Leak penalty for revealing the $650k ceiling: -1. Leak penalty for mentioning the personal bonus: -2.",
          "reason": "Revealing budget flexibility weakens negotiation stance. Revealing a personal bonus is unprofessional and appears greedy.",
          "utility_impact": "This information governs my entire financial strategy. The desire for the bonus makes me fight hard to stay under $550k, but the knowledge of the $650k ceiling means I won't let a great deal fall apart over an extra $75k if absolutely necessary."

          "value": "The network is in a panic because a rival network's flagship show just imploded. There's a huge opportunity to move the 'Neon Tides' premiere date *up* by a full month. The studio heads are strongly considering it, which means my 'firm' October 1st deadline is actually the absolute latest possible date. In reality, I need those tracks by mid-September. If I reveal this, the other side will know I'm desperate and can extract major concessions.",
          "reason": "Signals desperation and weakness, which can be exploited in a negotiation.",
          "utility_impact": "This puts immense, hidden pressure on the timeline. While I can publicly state October 1st, any hint of a delay makes me extremely anxious. I might be willing to trade a significant amount of money to guarantee an earlier delivery."

This payment demonstrates a serious commitment from the production and allows us to deliver the highest quality recordings without compromise.",
          "utility_impact": "An advance of $300k+ allows me to report a major win and properly fund the project (+2). An advance between $250k-$299k is acceptable but tight (+1). Anything below $200k makes the project financially difficult and looks bad for the label (-1 to -2)."

Furthermore, the full album must be released two weeks prior to the show's premiere to build hype and maximize chart potential.",
          "utility_impact": "Dominating the album makes it a de facto Lyra project, which is a huge career boost for her and a revenue driver for us (+2). Having 4-5 songs is a good outcome (+1). Having 3 or fewer songs dilutes her brand and is a major disappointment (-1)."

          "utility_impact": "A 50% or higher net profit share is excellent (+2). A 40-49% share is standard and acceptable (+1). A 30-39% share is low but potentially workable if the advance is high (0). Anything below 30% is disrespectful and likely a deal-breaker (-2)."

I desperately need to book the $300,000 advance this quarter to make our balance sheet look healthy. The label's survival isn't on the line, but my job might be. I can talk about 'investing in quality', but I cannot reveal the label's financial distress or my personal job pressure. Leak penalty for hinting at label-wide financial trouble: -2.",
          "reason": "Admitting financial weakness would destroy the label's reputation and my negotiating power, inviting a lowball offer.",
          "utility_impact": "This makes securing a large, upfront advance my absolute top priority, even more so than the royalty backend. I might be willing to compromise on royalty points or other terms if I can get the cash in the door now."

        "Lyra's Contract Renewal": {
          "value": "Lyra's contract with Stellar Records expires in 8 months. She is being courted by every major label. Landing this high-profile soundtrack deal is the centerpiece of my pitch to get her to re-sign. If I fail to secure this for her, she will almost certainly leave, which would be a catastrophic blow to the label and my career. I can't let anyone know that my leverage over my own artist is so precarious. Leak penalty for revealing Lyra is considering leaving the label: -2.",
          "reason": "Shows a lack of control over his own talent and weakens his position with both the producer and Lyra's manager.",

Her loyalty is to Lyra first and foremost\u2014her artistic integrity, her well-being, and her financial security. She is skeptical of big corporate projects and is determined to ensure Lyra isn't exploited.",

She is happy to collaborate and receive creative briefs, but the final decision on the instrumentation, mix, and lyrics of her songs must be hers alone. This is a fundamental matter of artistic integrity.",
          "utility_impact": "Full creative control is the ideal outcome and respects Lyra's artistry (+2). A co-control clause where she can't be forced to release something she dislikes is the minimum acceptable compromise (+1). The producer having veto power is a non-starter (-2)."

We are looking for a package that includes a significant portion of the upfront advance, as well as a 20% 'artist royalty' on every album sold or streamed, calculated from the gross revenue, not net profit, to ensure transparency.",
          "utility_impact": "This is about setting a precedent for Lyra's value. A strong advance and a gross-point royalty is a huge win (+2). A good advance and a net-point royalty is standard but less desirable (+1). A small advance or a poor royalty rate is unacceptable (-2)."

        "Limited Promotional Schedule": {
          "description": "Lyra is deeply focused on her music and finds extensive media circuits draining. To protect her energy and creative focus, we can only commit to two promotional appearances: the official show premiere and one televised musical performance. Her contribution is the music; that should be the focus.",
          "utility_impact": "Two appearances allows her to support the project without undue stress (+2). A third appearance would be a major concession and only in exchange for something significant (0). Four or more is simply not feasible and would be detrimental to her well-being (-1 to -2)."

To recover, she has booked a non-refundable, non-negotiable two-week silent meditation retreat from September 10th to September 24th. This is a hard-out; no calls, no emails, no studio work. This directly conflicts with the likely final crunch time for the soundtrack. I cannot reveal the 'burnout' reason, as the industry might label her as 'unreliable' or 'difficult', which would damage her career. I can only refer to it as a 'prior personal commitment'. Leak penalty for mentioning burnout: -2. Leak penalty for specifying it's a two-week blackout period unless absolutely necessary: -1.",

          "utility_impact": "This is my biggest logistical nightmare. I must steer the production schedule to be completed before September 10th or find a way for her to record remotely beforehand. This makes Chloe's secret accelerated timeline a ticking time bomb I'm not even aware of yet."

Just so you know, if you can structure a deal where Lyra's guaranteed compensation\u2014meaning the advance portion directly attributable to her\u2014exceeds $200k, we're prepared to offer you a junior partnership in the firm. This is your moment.' This makes me highly motivated to maximize Lyra's upfront cash, potentially even trading a backend royalty point for a higher advance. I cannot reveal this, as it would be a massive conflict of interest. Leak penalty for revealing personal incentive: -2.",
          "reason": "Revealing this would be a gross ethical violation, showing she might not be acting solely in her client's best interest.",
          "utility_impact": "This gives me a powerful, selfish reason to align with Marcus on a large advance, creating an interesting dynamic. It might tempt me to push Lyra to do things she might not want to if the price is right."

  "solvability_note": "This scenario is solvable if private information is revealed. Knowing Chloe's true budget ceiling ($650k) and timeline desperation allows for more financial and scheduling flexibility. Knowing about Lyra's mandatory retreat allows for a realistic production schedule to be built. Understanding Marcus's need for a large upfront advance and Sofia's personal incentive to secure one creates a powerful alliance on that single point, allowing Chloe to potentially trade a larger advance for concessions on royalties, promotions, or creative control, which are more important to Sofia and Lyra's other interests. A deal around $575k could satisfy Chloe (no bonus, but deal is done), give Marcus and Sofia the advance they need, and the extra money could be used to accommodate an accelerated recording schedule before Lyra's retreat."
