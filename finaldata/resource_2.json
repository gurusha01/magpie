A possible optimal solution is: Tanaka gets his 300 hours in early July (satisfying his need to go first and avoid the August shutdown). Thorne gets a compromised 450 hours spread across late July and early August in several blocks (satisfying his real need for fragmented time and his August 15th deadline).
