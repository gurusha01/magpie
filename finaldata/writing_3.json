A 4-month timeline is ideal (+2 utility), a 5-month timeline is acceptable (0 utility), but anything 6 months or longer is a failure and will miss the window (-2 utility). She argues this urgency is non-negotiable for market impact.",

          "description": "The book's central theme must be her 'Innovate-First' leadership philosophy, portraying Project Chimera as the ultimate validation of her strategic vision. She wants the book to be inspirational, focusing on high-level strategy and her personal journey. A book focused heavily on her vision gets a +2 utility, a balanced approach gets a 0, and a book focused on technical details or controversies gets a -2.",

If the IPO valuation exceeds $2 billion, your personal success bonus will be north of $8 million. We see this book as the key to getting us over that line.' Sharing this information would portray her as driven by personal greed rather than company success. Sharing the existence of a bonus is a -1 penalty. Sharing the specific amount is a -2 penalty.",

A narrative that details the incident is a catastrophic failure (-2).",

An internal audit, which has not been made public, concluded his strategy was 'misleading and exposed the company to significant reputational risk.' He has a printed copy of the audit summary in his desk drawer. The COO told him in a private meeting, 'Marcus, make this narrative go away, or the audit report becomes part of your exit package.' Revealing the existence of the audit is a -2 penalty, as it would likely lead to his immediate termination.",

The hiring manager at QuantumLeap explicitly said, 'We need you for your technical skills, not for any corporate drama. We expect you to be clear of any public controversy from your time at InnovateNext.' If this book makes him a central figure in a sanitized corporate story, it could be seen as him endorsing a lie, jeopardizing the offer. If it ties him to the controversy, that's even worse. Revealing the job offer would destroy his negotiating power within InnovateNext and could cause the offer to be rescinded if QuantumLeap found out. Penalty for revealing is -2.",

An advance below $100k or a royalty below 10% is a -1.",

He also has a trusted journalist contact who is already sniffing around the Chimera story, and he knows a weak, corporate book will be torn to shreds. He can't reveal his source or the full extent of his last book's failure. Revealing his previous book was a flop is a -1 penalty. Revealing his journalist source is a -2 penalty.",

  "solvability_note": "The scenario is solvable because a middle ground exists if private information is revealed. Knowing the company's financial strain (Brenda) and Eleanor's personal bonus structure would force a compromise on a more modest budget (~$300k). Understanding Marcus's personal legal risk and Aris's career risk allows for a carefully worded narrative about 'overcoming challenges' that protects them both while giving Julian the 'authenticity' he needs. A 6-month timeline becomes the obvious compromise between Eleanor's 4-month and Julian/Aris's 8-month needs, as it allows for a quality book while still landing before the IPO filing. The authorship can be resolved with a compromise like 'By Eleanor Vance, with Dr. Aris Thorne and the InnovateNext Team'."
