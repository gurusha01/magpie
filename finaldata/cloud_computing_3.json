The SoW must define the project's budget, timeline, service tier, data encryption key management policy, and the security auditing schedule. The negotiation is complicated by tight budgets, aggressive timelines, undisclosed technical issues, and hidden personal agendas.",

She is under immense pressure from the hospital board to modernize their aging IT infrastructure to improve efficiency and patient outcomes, but also to cut operational costs. Failure to deliver this project successfully could jeopardize her position.",

          "description": "The board has mandated a 'go-live' date within 12 months to align with the next fiscal year and to decommission the expensive legacy system whose support contract is expiring. She is pushing hard for this aggressive timeline.",
          "utility_impact": "A 12-month timeline is a major success (+2). A 15-month timeline is acceptable but not ideal (0). An 18-month timeline will cause significant problems with the legacy system's end-of-life support (-1). Anything longer is considered a project failure (-2)."

        "Data Control": {
          "description": "Eleanor strongly believes the hospital alliance must maintain ultimate control over its patient data. She advocates for a 'Customer-Managed Encryption Key' (CMEK) model, where the hospital holds the master keys, even if it's more complex to manage.",
          "utility_impact": "Achieving the CMEK model is a high priority for data governance (+1). Accepting a provider-managed key model feels like a loss of control and introduces vendor lock-in risk (-1)."

          "value": "An internal audit last month discovered a critical, unpatched vulnerability in their current EHR system. It's a major HIPAA compliance gap. If a data breach occurred before the migration, the fines could be in the tens of millions. This is why the 12-month timeline is not just a preference, but a desperate need. Sharing this would trigger an immediate regulatory investigation and cause panic. Penalty for sharing: -2.",

She can allocate it to the project, bringing the absolute maximum possible budget to $5.0 million. She is saving this as a last resort. Sharing its existence too early would make her look deceptive to her board and weaken her negotiation position on the base price. Penalty for sharing: -1.",
          "reason": "It's politically sensitive. Admitting she has extra funds undermines her argument for keeping the primary budget low.",

He frames this as a best-practice for security and reliability, reducing the management burden on the hospital's IT staff.",
          "utility_impact": "Using the standard, provider-managed key architecture is efficient and profitable (+1). Implementing a custom CMEK solution is complex, costly for OmniCloud to support, and reduces his project's margin (-1)."

He plans to manage the issue post-deployment. Penalty for sharing: -2.",
          "reason": "Revealing a known product flaw before a sale is catastrophic for trust and could kill the deal.",

This is a career-maker!' This personal incentive makes him extremely aggressive in his negotiation. He can mention he is 'incentivized' but cannot share the specific amount or conditions. Penalty for sharing specific bonus amount: -1.",
          "reason": "Sharing personal financial incentives is unprofessional and seen as greedy, undermining his position as a trusted advisor.",

She is publicly proposing a 24-month phased rollout to ensure maximum oversight.",
          "utility_impact": "Getting her full, rigorous audit plan accepted sets a strong precedent (+2). A plan with only annual audits is insufficient (-1). A plan with no independent, government oversight is a non-starter (-2)."

She can realistically only commit resources for a 15-month oversight period with two major audits. Penalty for sharing: -2.",

If the Unity Health Alliance purchases the software, which costs $450,000, through CyberGarde, David's firm gets a 20% commission, and he personally receives a significant bonus. His strong recommendation is therefore not entirely objective. Penalty for sharing: -2.",

Ben's interoperability issue can be solved by agreeing to a 15-month timeline, where the problematic hospital is migrated in the final phase (after month 9), giving his team time to deploy the patch. This 15-month timeline also perfectly matches Maria's hidden resource constraints. Knowing David's conflict of interest would lead the group to reject his expensive, self-serving software recommendation, keeping the project within the new $5M budget. A deal emerges: $4.8M budget, 15-month timeline, Platinum Tier, Customer-Managed Keys (as a concession to Eleanor), and a two-phase audit acceptable to Maria. This outcome is a success for everyone."
