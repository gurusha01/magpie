The illegality of Viper Capital's stake accumulation gives the company and the SEC immense leverage to force a more reasonable settlement. The board's willingness to replace the CEO provides a mechanism to break the stalemate. The co-activist's liquidity crisis and the institutional investor's bonus incentive create pressure for a quick deal. The optimal solution is likely the CEO's retirement (with his parachute), one board seat for Vance, and a moderate stock buyback funded by the now-defunct R&D budget, allowing all parties to save face and avoid their worst-case scenarios (SEC fines, fund collapse, proxy fight)."
