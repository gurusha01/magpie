      "role": "SVP of Regulatory Affairs, Titan Energy",
      "description": "David is a seasoned corporate lobbyist representing Titan Energy, a large, traditional fossil fuel company that is the state's largest emitter. His primary objective is to protect the company's bottom line by minimizing the financial impact of the new carbon regulations and ensuring the company's long-term operational stability.",
      "shareable_preferences": {
        "Initial Carbon Price": {
          "description": "David is advocating for a very low introductory price for carbon credits to ease the company into the new market. He will publicly argue that a high price will shock the energy market and raise consumer electricity bills. He is pushing for a price in the $10-$20 per ton range. Utility: +2 for price <= $15; +1 for price between $16-$25; 0 for price between $26-$35; -1 for price between $36-$45; -2 for price > $45.",
          "utility_impact": "A low price is paramount as it directly translates to lower compliance costs. Every dollar increase in the price per ton represents millions of dollars in annual expenses for Titan. This preference will make him extremely resistant to proposals for higher prices."
        },
        "Annual Offset Requirement": {
          "description": "He wants the lowest possible mandatory offset percentage. He will argue for a 'phased-in' approach, starting with a symbolic 1-2% of total emissions in the first year, to avoid operational disruption and give companies time to adapt. Utility: +2 for percentage <= 1.5%; +1 for percentage between 1.6%-2.5%; 0 for percentage between 2.6%-3.5%; -1 for percentage between 3.6%-5%; -2 for percentage > 5%.",
          "utility_impact": "This, combined with the price, determines the total compliance cost. He sees a low percentage as non-negotiable for the first year and will trade other concessions to keep this number as low as possible."
        },
        "Technology Eligibility": {
          "description": "David strongly advocates for a broad, 'all-of-the-above' technology portfolio. He specifically wants to include 'Carbon Capture, Utilization, and Storage (CCUS)' projects retrofitted onto existing fossil fuel plants, a technology Titan has invested in heavily. Utility: +2 if CCUS is included and is the primary eligible tech; +1 if CCUS is included among others; -1 if CCUS is excluded but other broad options exist; -2 if eligibility is restricted to non-industrial technologies.",
          "utility_impact": "Getting CCUS included allows Titan to potentially generate its own offsets, turning a regulatory cost into a potential revenue stream or at least an internal cost-saving measure. He will frame this as a pro-innovation, technology-neutral stance."

        "Undisclosed Compliance Failure": {
          "value": "Titan Energy's most recent internal emissions audit, which David has buried, revealed that their primary power plant has been emitting 15% more CO2e than officially reported to regulators due to a persistent and costly-to-fix turbine inefficiency. A high offset requirement would be financially catastrophic, potentially costing an extra $75M-$100M that is not in any budget. Penalty for revealing this is -2, as it would trigger an immediate SEC investigation, massive fines, and likely his termination.",
          "reason": "Revealing this information would cause a corporate scandal, a collapse in the company's stock price, and severe legal and financial repercussions for both the company and David personally.",
          "utility_impact": "This hidden liability is the real reason he is desperate for a low offset percentage and price. He cannot concede much on these points without putting his company and career in extreme jeopardy."

        "Confidential Trading Alliance": {
          "value": "David has a 'gentleman's agreement' with two other major industrial players in the state to form a purchasing bloc. They plan to coordinate their carbon credit purchases to suppress demand and keep the market price low once it's established. Penalty for revealing this is -1.5, as it would be viewed as anti-competitive market manipulation and would dissolve the alliance.",
          "reason": "This alliance is legally grey and admitting to it would expose the company to antitrust scrutiny and destroy any trust with the other negotiators.",
          "utility_impact": "This secret alliance gives him confidence that he can control prices *after* the market is established, making him slightly more flexible on the initial price if he can secure a very low offset percentage."

        "Personal Bonus Structure": {
          "value": "David received an email from Titan's CEO last week: 'David, your performance bonus this year is contingent on the outcome of this negotiation. Keep the total first-year compliance cost from this carbon market below $50 million, and a $250,000 bonus is yours. If it exceeds $75 million, you get nothing. Don't disappoint.' Penalty for revealing this is -1, as it would expose his motivations as purely financial and self-serving, destroying his credibility.",
          "reason": "Sharing this would make him appear greedy and unethical, undermining his arguments that he is acting in the best interest of the state's economy and energy consumers.",
          "utility_impact": "This creates a hard personal cap on what he can agree to. He will use an internal calculator throughout the negotiation to ensure any combination of Price x Offset % x Emissions does not exceed his bonus threshold."

        "Initial Carbon Price": {
          "description": "Maria is demanding a high initial price for carbon credits, arguing that it must be sufficient to compensate farmers for the significant costs and labor involved in switching to regenerative practices like no-till farming and cover cropping. She is pushing for a price in the $40-$60 per ton range. Utility: +2 for price >= $50; +1 for price between $40-$49; 0 for price between $30-$39; -1 for price between $20-$29; -2 for price < $20.",

        "Technology Eligibility": {
          "description": "Maria insists that eligibility should be narrowly focused on 'natural climate solutions,' specifically soil carbon sequestration and agricultural methane capture. She will argue these methods offer co-benefits like improved soil health and water quality, and that industrial solutions are a form of greenwashing. Utility: +2 if eligibility is restricted to agricultural methods only; +1 if agricultural methods are prioritized but others are allowed; -1 if all technologies are treated equally; -2 if agricultural methods are excluded or disadvantaged.",
          "utility_impact": "Restricting the technology gives her co-op a near-monopoly on the supply side of the market, which is crucial for maintaining price stability and ensuring her farmers get paid."

A confidential report from their science advisors warns that this uncertainty could be exploited by critics to discredit their credits if it becomes public before they can deploy the second-generation sensors (18 months away). Penalty for revealing this is -2, as it would immediately devalue their credits and could lead to accusations of fraud.",
          "reason": "Admitting to measurement uncertainty would destroy market confidence in their primary product before it even launches.",
          "utility_impact": "This makes Maria defensive about any calls for overly stringent verification protocols in the first two years, as she needs time to fix the issue quietly."

        "Program Profitability Threshold": {
          "value": "Internal financial models for the co-op show that the entire regenerative agriculture program is only profitable for the average farmer if the price of a carbon credit is at or above $35 per ton. Anything less, and the program operates at a net loss, and farmer participation will collapse within a year. Maria knows this is the absolute floor. Penalty for revealing this specific price floor is -1, as it would severely weaken her negotiating position by revealing her reservation point.",
          "reason": "Revealing her exact break-even point would give other negotiators, especially buyers, a clear target to aim for, preventing her from achieving a more profitable outcome for her farmers.",

If this looks weak, the press will eat us alive, and you can bet your position will be the first thing on the chopping block post-election.'

A confidential internal memo states this budget can only support the robust verification of one, or at most two, simple and geographically concentrated credit technologies. A market with many complex technologies (like soil sampling across 500 farms or validating experimental tech) would be impossible to police effectively. Penalty for revealing this is -1.5, as it would signal to everyone that the state is not truly committed to enforcement and that the market is a 'paper tiger'.",
          "reason": "Revealing the agency's lack of resources would undermine public trust in the market's integrity and invite bad actors to try and cheat the system.",

For example, a price of $35/ton meets Aris's scientific benchmark and saves Maria's program. An offset requirement of 4% creates enough demand for Maria and Chloe while being (barely) survivable for David, especially if he can get concessions elsewhere. For technology, including Maria's agricultural methods (to ensure supply) and creating a small, tightly-monitored 'pilot program' for Chloe's tech (satisfying her need for inclusion and Aris's need for control) is a viable path. David would have to abandon his push for CCUS in this round in exchange for the manageable price and percentage. Revealing the private information would make these trade-offs obvious and logical."
