  "task": "A group of five stakeholders must negotiate and agree on a final development plan for the expansion of the Blackwood Mountain Ski Resort. The final plan must be formalized in a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) that specifies the scale of the expansion, the budget allocation for different components, the timeline, and the specific environmental and cultural protections to be implemented. The goal is to find a mutually acceptable plan that balances economic growth, environmental stewardship, and cultural preservation.",

Anything less than 2 new lifts and 150 hectares she considers a major failure (-2 utility). The full 'Grand Summit' plan is her ideal outcome (+2 utility). A compromise of 2 lifts and 175 hectares would be acceptable (0 to +1 utility).",
          "utility_impact": "This is her primary goal. The scale of the expansion directly correlates with the projected revenue and return on investment. She will fight hard against any significant reduction in the development's size as it directly impacts her company's bottom line and her professional reputation."

          "description": "Fast-Tracked Timeline: She is pushing for project approval and breaking ground within 6 months, with a 24-month construction timeline. A 6-month approval timeline is ideal (+2 utility). A delay to 12 months is undesirable (-1 utility), and any timeline extending beyond 18 months for approval is unacceptable (-2 utility) as it jeopardizes financing.",

Sharing the true projection (penalty: -1) would empower other agents to demand a much larger share of concessions and benefits. The project must deliver a minimum 15% ROI to shareholders.",
          "reason": "Revealing the true profit potential would dramatically weaken her negotiating position, making her appear greedy and giving others leverage to demand more costly concessions.",
          "utility_impact": "This knowledge makes her resistant to any cost-adding measures (e.g., extensive environmental remediation, community benefit funds) unless they are absolutely necessary for approval. She knows she has a lot of room to bargain, but wants to keep it all."

Sharing this information would be catastrophic to her reputation (penalty: -2).",
          "reason": "This information would frame her motivations as purely personal greed, destroying her credibility and making her appear untrustworthy to all other parties, especially the community and regulator.",

A buffer of 150 hectares or more would be a major conservation win (+2 utility). A plan that only meets the 100-hectare minimum is neutral (0 utility). Any plan proposing less than 100 hectares is an automatic rejection and would result in a very negative outcome for him (-2 utility).",

A basic plan that just meets current standards is acceptable (0 utility).",

A protracted legal battle involving appeals and litigation with a well-funded corporation like Apex would drain his entire annual budget and paralyze his department's other work. Revealing this (penalty: -2) would signal weakness and invite developers to stonewall or sue, knowing his agency can't sustain a long fight.",

It's a small, 5-hectare grove of ancient cedar trees located precisely where Apex has planned the foundation for their luxury condominiums. Sunstone Ridge is important, but it's a decoy. Revealing the true location before a protection agreement is signed is a profound risk (penalty: -2), as the developers could use it as a powerful and cynical bargaining chip.",

          "utility_impact": "This is her most critical secret. She MUST steer development away from that 5-hectare plot at all costs, even if it means sacrificing ground elsewhere. She might trade concessions on Sunstone Ridge if she can get the condo project moved without revealing why."

Revealing this division (penalty: -2) would allow Apex to bypass her and try to cut a separate deal with the dissenting faction.",

His top priority is a $5 million upgrade to the resort's snowmaking system and a $3 million replacement of the primary access road bridge. Getting both funded is his ideal outcome (+2 utility). Getting just the snowmaking funded is acceptable (0 utility). Getting neither funded would be disastrous for future operations (-2 utility).",

The required upgrade costs $8 million, a figure he knows Isabella has not included in her budget.

A plan that ignores this data would be a professional failure for her (-2 utility).",

Knowing about the failing water plant and the high-profit projections makes the necessary $8M upgrade a logical and affordable inclusion. Knowing the dire climate data forces a shift from a massive 30-year plan to a more modest, resilient 15-year plan, which is smaller, less environmentally damaging, and thus more acceptable to the regulator and the tribe. This smaller, faster-to-approve plan still offers Isabella a solid profit and a quick approval, satisfying her core needs."
