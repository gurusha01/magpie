Management has proposed a new 'flex-shift' system involving 10-hour, 4-day shifts (4x10) to increase productivity and reduce explicit overtime costs. The union is skeptical, concerned about worker fatigue, safety, and potential loss of income. The group must produce a single, signed agreement outlining the new plan.",

Knowledge of the required maintenance on Machine #7 (David's info) and the hidden overtime costs (Frank's info) creates an opportunity.

The massive savings from eliminating hidden overtime costs can fund both a modest wage increase (e.g., 2.5-3%) and Maria's wellness program.
