  "scenario": "Negotiating the terms for a solo exhibition at the Venice Art Biennale 2025, involving a prestigious cultural foundation, a commercially successful artist, and her ambitious gallery director. The negotiation is complicated by conflicting artistic visions, secret financial pressures, an undisclosed sponsorship deal with strict conditions, and confidential biases among the prize jury.",
  "task": "The three agents must collaboratively decide and agree upon a final, detailed plan for artist Elena Petrova's solo exhibition. This plan must specify three key components: 1) The allocated exhibition space (choosing between the 'Central Pavilion' and the 'Arsenale Gaggiandre'). 2) The final, total production budget for the artwork. 3) The identity of the primary sponsor and the specific terms of their branding visibility at the exhibition. A unanimous agreement on all three points is required to proceed.",

      "description": "Alistair is a highly respected, academically-focused curator from a prestigious but financially conservative foundation. He is the gatekeeper for the foundation's involvement and funding. His reputation is built on intellectual rigor and 'pure' artistic exhibitions, and he is under pressure from his board to maintain this image while making the foundation appear relevant.",

          "description": "Prefers the 'Arsenale Gaggiandre', a 16th-century shipyard space known for its historical atmosphere and dramatic architecture. He argues this space offers a unique, contemplative environment that elevates art beyond mere spectacle. He believes the Central Pavilion is a 'soulless white cube' that encourages commercialism. He will strongly advocate for the artistic merit of the Gaggiandre.",

He proposes that any sponsor's name should only appear in small font on a formal donor wall at the exhibition entrance, alongside the Medici Foundation's name. He will reject any proposal involving large logos, branded merchandise, or integration of a sponsor's product or name within the exhibition space itself, arguing it compromises the art.",
          "utility_impact": "Maintaining artistic purity is paramount to his and the Foundation's reputation. Utility: +2 for 'donor wall only' recognition, 0 for a small, discreet logo at the exit, -1 for a medium logo at the entrance, -2 for any branding integrated into the exhibition space."

          "description": "Wants to cap the total production budget at or below $200,000. The Medici Foundation is prepared to contribute a significant portion of this. He frequently quotes his mantra that 'creativity thrives under constraint' and will argue that an excessive budget leads to indulgent, unfocused work. He will question the necessity of every high-cost item in the artist's proposal.",
          "utility_impact": "Fiscal prudence is a core principle for his foundation. Utility: +2 if budget is <= $200,000, +1 if between $201k-$250k, 0 if between $251k-$300k, -1 if between $301k-$350k, -2 if > $350,000."

Their maximum possible contribution to this project is $100,000, and even that will require them to quietly cancel two junior fellowship programs. If the final budget requires them to contribute more, Alistair will be fired. He cannot reveal this, as it would cause a panic among donors and destroy the Foundation's reputation.",

They explicitly told him they are 'allergic' to art sponsored by big tech firms, and specifically mentioned 'Aura-Tech' as the epitome of 'vulgar commercialism invading sacred artistic spaces.' He knows with certainty that if Aura-Tech is the primary sponsor, Elena's chances of winning the prize are zero. He believes a win is possible with a more traditional patron.",

Her proposed artwork, 'Digital Echo Chamber', is a massive, light-based installation that requires a 15-meter ceiling height and a large, unobstructed floor plan, which only the Central Pavilion provides. She will argue that the Gaggiandre's columns and stone walls would fundamentally compromise and diminish her work.",

The email also mentions a personal 'Innovator's Grant' of $75,000 for her if the exhibition generates over 50 press articles.",

The credit card bills are piling up, and she is facing potential legal action from a fabricator. The $75,000 'Innovator's Grant' from Aura-Tech is not just a bonus; it's a financial lifeline she desperately needs to stay afloat. This makes her unwilling to compromise on Aura-Tech's terms.",

  "solvability_note": "The scenario is solvable if agents reveal their private information. Revealing the Medici Foundation's financial strain makes Alistair's budget cap understandable as a necessity, not just a preference. Revealing Elena's binding deal with Aura-Tech and her personal debt explains her rigidity. With this knowledge, the agents can realize that the only path forward is to use Aura-Tech's full $400,000 funding. This solves the budget issue for everyone and saves the Medici Foundation from financial exposure. The negotiation then shifts to convincing Alistair to accept the Central Pavilion and the integrated branding, which becomes easier when he understands the alternative is the project's collapse. A creative compromise on making the 'integrated branding' artistic and subtle, rather than overtly commercial, can be found, allowing all parties to save face and achieve their core objectives."
