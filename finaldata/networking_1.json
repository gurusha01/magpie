Alistair will argue that this is the only path to ensure immediate regulatory approval and consumer trust. He wants this designated as the 'Generation 1' standard. Utility upon success: +2.",
          "utility_impact": "This is Alistair's most important public goal. Achieving it validates his life's work, secures his company's position as the technical leader, and opens up significant revenue from licensing their extensive patent portfolio.

Utility upon success: +1.",
          "utility_impact": "This model seems equitable on the surface, but it also strategically limits the cash drain on Voltaic while leveraging the focused, lower-cost talent from startups.

Penalty for revealing the specific 40% degradation figure: -2. Penalty for vaguely mentioning 'cold weather challenges': -1.",

Penalty for revealing the existence of his bonus: -2.",

Utility upon success: +2.",
          "utility_impact": "For a high-volume manufacturer like Eon, a 3% royalty represents a massive, unpredictable future cost. A flat fee allows them to budget precisely and keeps their per-vehicle cost low, which is Kenji's primary performance metric."

This satisfies Kenji's hidden goal for 'Project Chimera.' They could use Voltaic's cobalt-free LFP for the bulk of the pack (satisfying Kenji's cost-risk concerns and Alistair's need to use LFP) and integrate Nexus's SSB tech as a high-performance module (solving Voltaic's cold-weather problem and giving Nexus a path to market). The consortium's R&D fund could be directed at improving Nexus's manufacturing yield. The licensing could be a compromise: a smaller flat fee plus a small royalty on the SSB module only, giving Nexus the cash it needs to survive without overburdening Eon Motors."
