      "role": "Director of Urban Planning, City of Northwood",
      "description": "Maria is a career civil servant with 20 years of experience. She is pragmatic, data-driven, and politically astute. Her primary goal is to deliver a successful public project that satisfies residents, stays within budget, and generates long-term value for the city. She is under pressure from the Mayor's office to show a 'win' that combines green initiatives with economic growth.",
      "shareable_preferences": {
        "preference1": {
          "description": "Balanced Land Use: Maria advocates for a mixed-use approach. She proposes dedicating 10-12 acres to the public park and selling the remaining 8-10 acres for private development. This would generate revenue to offset park development costs and increase the city's tax base. A park smaller than 8 acres is a political failure (-2 utility), 10-12 acres is ideal (+2 utility), and a park larger than 15 acres is seen as fiscally irresponsible as it forfeits too much potential land sale revenue (-1 utility).",
          "utility_impact": "This preference drives her to find a compromise between the pure environmentalist and pure commercial interests. She will use the city's budget as a lever, offering more funding for a plan that aligns with this balanced vision."

          "description": "Strict Budget Adherence: The City Council has approved a maximum capital expenditure of $3 million for this project, covering land remediation and basic park infrastructure (paths, lighting, seeding). Any outcome that requires more than $3M from the city is impossible and represents a negotiation failure (-2 utility). Coming in under budget, between $2.5M and $2.8M, would be a major professional victory (+2 utility), while spending the full $3M is acceptable but not ideal (0 utility).",
          "utility_impact": "Maria will be highly resistant to any proposal that shifts unforeseen costs to the city. She will scrutinize every feature and phase for cost-effectiveness."

          "description": "Public-Facing Amenities: To ensure the park is a success with the community and her superiors, Maria wants to include at least two major public amenities, such as a modern playground, a splash pad, or a community amphitheater. Securing three such amenities would be a huge win (+2 utility), two is the target (+1 utility), one is disappointing (0 utility), and zero would be a public relations disaster (-2 utility).",
          "utility_impact": "She will look to the private donor and the developer to help fund these amenities, as her own budget is primarily for infrastructure and remediation."

However, Maria has a final, confidential report on her desk indicating that the contamination is less severe than feared. The actual remediation cost will only be $700,000. She can share that 'costs might be lower than projected' (penalty: 0), but if she reveals the exact figure of $700,000, it would cause a political scandal about why the city inflated the initial number, potentially costing her her job (penalty: -2 utility).",
          "reason": "Revealing the true, lower cost would undermine the city's negotiating position and lead to accusations of mismanagement or deception from the press and city council, creating a major political liability.",
          "utility_impact": "This knowledge gives her a secret $800,000 in unallocated funds within her $3M budget. She can use this to absorb unexpected costs, fund one of her desired amenities, or offer it as a major concession at a critical moment. She is tempted to reveal it to close a deal, but fears the professional fallout."

His ideal outcome is the full 20 acres being converted into a natural preserve (+2 utility). He considers any private development on the site a loss. He can grudgingly accept a park as small as 15 acres (-1 utility), but anything smaller is a betrayal of his members' trust and a failure of his mission (-2 utility).",
          "utility_impact": "He will start negotiations with a firm 'no development' stance and will be highly suspicious of any attempts to reduce the park's footprint. He will frame the debate in moral terms of ecological preservation versus corporate greed."

A plan that achieves this is a huge success (+2 utility). A plan that uses manicured lawns, ornamental gardens, and non-native plants is an ecological travesty (-2 utility).",
          "utility_impact": "He will reject any design proposals that resemble a traditional city park with extensive lawns or ornamental flowerbeds, arguing for a more 'wild' and ecologically functional space. This may conflict with desires for playgrounds or amphitheaters."

However, the grant has a strict legal covenant: the funds can *only* be used for the 'acquisition and restoration of certified wetland habitats' and must be fully allocated to a project within this fiscal year (9 months from now). The grant cannot be used for general park creation, maintenance, playgrounds, or land acquisition. He has been fundraising publicly for the 'entire park,' so revealing that he has this massive, restricted grant would make it seem like he misled his grassroots donors (penalty: -2 utility). He can hint at 'potential outside funding for ecological features' (penalty: -1 utility).",
          "reason": "Revealing the grant's specific nature would anger his donor base who gave smaller amounts for the general park effort, and it would weaken his negotiating position to demand city funding for non-wetland portions of the park.",
          "utility_impact": "This grant perfectly covers the cost of his most desired feature (the wetland) but he cannot use it for anything else. This creates a strong internal pressure to ensure the final agreement includes a significant wetland component, even if it means conceding on the total park size. He's tempted to use the grant as a bargaining chip, but it risks his reputation."

This size allows him to maximize the land available for his development, which he argues will generate significant tax revenue for the city. An 8-acre park is his ideal (+2 utility). A 10-acre park is acceptable (0 utility). A park larger than 12 acres severely compromises the financial viability of his project, making it a poor outcome (-2 utility).",

          "description": "High-End Aesthetics and Access: Liam insists that the portion of the park bordering his property must be beautifully landscaped and include premium features like stone pathways, artistic lighting, and a grand entrance feature. This 'curb appeal' is critical for attracting the wealthy tenants his business model relies on. Achieving this premium design is a major win (+2 utility). Basic park design is a disappointment (-1 utility), and a wild, unmanaged border is a deal-breaker (-2 utility).",

The lease is worth $40 million over 10 years but contains two critical, non-negotiable clauses: 1) The development must break ground within 9 months, and 2) The design must include a 'premium, aesthetically-pleasing park entrance' directly adjacent to the store's location. If he reveals the tenant's name, Verdant Market will pull out due to a strict NDA clause (penalty: -2 utility). If he reveals the existence of a signed lease without naming the tenant, it weakens his future negotiating power with other tenants (penalty: -1 utility).",

The foundation has already commissioned the statue for $150,000 (to be paid from the $2M donation). This is not a suggestion; it is a binding condition. Revealing this 'tacky' requirement too early could lead to public ridicule and cause the other parties to reject the donation entirely (penalty: -1 utility for revealing before a general agreement on size and budget is reached). Failure to include the statue means the entire $2M donation is forfeited.",

Liam's secret deadline and need for a 'premium entrance' align with the donor's desire for 'beautification' and a fast timeline. Eleanor's need to place the statue can be met within the 'premium entrance' or 'beautification' budget. The overlapping 6 and 9-month deadlines force a compromise. A potential solution is a 12-acre park, leaving 8 for Liam, with a $1.2M wetland (funded by David's grant), a premium entrance with a statue (funded by Eleanor's donation), and a playground (funded by Maria's budget surplus), all on an accelerated timeline."
