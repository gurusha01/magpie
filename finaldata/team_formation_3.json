The demo for them needs to be incredibly flashy and focus on novel AI features, even if the backend isn't fully robust. Stability is secondary to the 'wow factor' for this specific demo.

Ben's and Mark's concerns about Sarah's management style (backed by data) become concrete risks to mitigate. Sarah's promotion-or-quit ultimatum, backed by a real offer, clarifies the stakes. A clear compromise exists: Appoint Sarah as Project Lead to meet Evelyn's strategic need and retain Sarah, but also appoint Mark as 'Technical Lead' with explicit authority over architectural quality and team workload. This satisfies Ben's need to protect his engineers, gives Mark a leadership role for his promotion, and puts a necessary check on Sarah's high-risk tendencies, creating a balanced leadership team that can achieve the project's true goals."
