The agreement must address wages, healthcare contributions, workplace safety, and contract duration. A resolution is urgently needed to prevent further economic damage to the company, its workers, and its key clients.",

      "role": "Chief Operating Officer, AeroForge Dynamics",
      "description": "David is a sharp, data-driven executive under immense pressure from the board to maintain profitability. He sees the strike as a direct threat to the company's Q4 performance and his own career trajectory. He publicly projects an image of fiscal restraint, arguing that the company cannot afford the union's 'unrealistic' demands.",

        "wage_increase": {
          "description": "Propose a maximum 3% wage increase. David will argue this is the absolute ceiling the company can afford without risking layoffs, citing narrow, publicly reported profit margins and increased material costs. He will frame this as a generous offer given the 'tough economic climate'. Utility: +2 for <=2%, +1 for 3%, 0 for 4%, -1 for 5-7%, -2 for >7%.",
          "utility_impact": "Keeping wage increases minimal is his primary performance metric. A low settlement would secure his bonus and position him for a promotion. A high settlement would be seen as a personal failure by the board."

        "healthcare_contributions": {
          "description": "Increase the employee's share of healthcare premiums from the current 20% to 30%. David will present industry data (carefully selected) showing this is standard practice and necessary to offset the 12% annual rise in healthcare costs. Utility: +2 for 30% employee share, +1 for 25%, 0 for 20% (status quo), -1 for 15%, -2 for <15%.",
          "utility_impact": "Shifting healthcare costs is a key part of his long-term cost-containment strategy. This is a non-negotiable point for the board of directors."

David can hint that 'business is solid' but cannot reveal the source or the exact amount. Revealing the $15.7M figure carries a -2 utility penalty for violating SEC quiet period rules and infuriating the board. He recently received a congratulatory email from the CEO about his role in securing this, which mentioned his upcoming $250,000 bonus tied directly to this undisclosed profit.",
          "reason": "Revealing this information would constitute a breach of fiduciary duty, likely lead to his immediate termination, and could trigger an SEC investigation into the company's financial disclosures.",
          "utility_impact": "This knowledge creates immense internal conflict. He knows he can afford more, but admitting it would destroy his career. He is tempted to use this knowledge to make a slightly more generous 'final offer' to seem like a hero, without revealing the source."

The report includes dated photographs and maintenance logs proving that management was aware of a critical stress fracture in the Line 3 hydraulic press for over 6 months and deliberately chose not to repair it to avoid a production slowdown. The report estimates a 40% chance of catastrophic failure in the next 1000 operational hours. She can allude to 'serious, documented safety issues' but revealing the report itself carries a -2 utility penalty, as it would likely trigger an immediate federal plant shutdown by OSHA, costing all her members their jobs while the investigation proceeds.",

          "utility_impact": "This information is her ultimate trump card, but using it is a mutually assured destruction scenario. She is tempted to leak it to the press if David Chen refuses to budge on the safety investment, hoping the public pressure will force his hand without a full shutdown."

The data shows the true market-rate wage is 8.5% higher than what AeroForge currently pays. This means the Union's 15% demand is high, but the company's 3% offer is significantly below market. Her mandate forbids her from sharing the report directly, as it's privileged data. Revealing the specific 8.5% figure would be a severe breach of protocol, carrying a -2 utility penalty. She can only guide the conversation, for example, by saying 'My experience suggests that settlements in your sector have been landing in the high single digits recently.'",

Utility: +2 for >=3 year guarantee, 0 for 2 years, -2 for <2 years or no guarantee.",

He has the sole authority to send the activation wire. If a deal is not reached and production restart is not guaranteed within 24 hours, he will activate the contract, which would immediately move 80% of Stellara's business ($40M annually) away from AeroForge. He can hint at 'exploring other options' or 'contingency planning,' but revealing the existence of a signed contract would be an extreme act of bad faith that would destroy the business relationship forever and give AeroForge no incentive to cooperate on the orderly transition of tooling and IP. This carries a -2 utility penalty.",

  "solvability_note": "The scenario is solvable because the hidden information provides a clear path to a mutually beneficial agreement. David's undisclosed profits ($15.7M) are more than sufficient to cover Maria's key demands (a wage increase around 10% and the $2M safety investment). The threat of Samuel's hidden ultimatum (losing a $40M/year client) provides the overwhelming incentive for David to make these concessions. Maria's hidden knowledge of the safety issue gives her the leverage to ensure the investment is non-negotiable. Dr. Reed's private data can guide both parties toward a fair wage settlement without revealing the source. A deal around a 9-10% wage increase, a $2M safety investment, healthcare status quo, and a 3-year contract would satisfy the core needs of all parties once the private pressures are understood."
