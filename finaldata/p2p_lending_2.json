  "task": "A fintech platform, 'P2P LendSecure', is facing scrutiny after a recent, quiet uptick in loan defaults. A group of five key stakeholders has been assembled to negotiate a new 'Platform Integrity and Growth Protocol'. This protocol will define the terms for a new, crucial pool of $1,000,000 in loans. The negotiation must balance investor returns, entrepreneur access to capital, platform profitability, and regulatory compliance. The group must come to a unanimous agreement on three key parameters: the Platform Fee, the level of Risk Underwriting Model Transparency, and the Default Recovery Fund Contribution.",

        "Low Default Recovery Fund Contribution": {
          "description": "Chloe wants the Default Recovery Fund contribution to be as low as possible, ideally 0.5% or less. She views this as a direct tax on her loan, increasing her overall cost of capital. A lower contribution means she can allocate more of the loan towards her business growth. Utility: +2 for <=0.5%, +1 for 0.6%-1.0%, 0 for 1.1%-1.5%, -1 for 1.6%-2.0%, -2 for >2.0%.",
          "utility_impact": "This directly impacts the affordability of her loan. A high contribution might force her to seek less favorable funding elsewhere or cut back on her expansion plans, jeopardizing her business."

        "High Algorithm Transparency": {
          "description": "Chloe strongly advocates for high transparency in the platform's credit scoring algorithm. She wants to understand the key metrics used to evaluate her business so she can improve her score or contest what she feels is an unfair assessment. She wants more than just a score; she wants to see the primary factors and their general weightings. Utility: +2 for 'Partial Transparency' (key variables shared), +1 for 'Summary Stats', 0 for 'Black Box', -1 for any outcome that feels arbitrary.",
          "utility_impact": "Transparency builds trust and provides actionable feedback. A 'black box' system feels unfair and arbitrary, leaving her powerless and potentially blocking access to capital for deserving but non-traditional businesses like hers."

However, her internal, more realistic model, which accounts for potential market saturation, indicates a more modest 18-22% growth. She is concerned that revealing this discrepancy would immediately lead to a higher interest rate or an outright loan rejection. She can state 'our projections are strong' but cannot share the specific numbers. Sharing the 18-22% figure carries a penalty of -2.",
          "reason": "Revealing this would undermine her credibility and negotiating position, likely resulting in the failure to secure the necessary funding for her business's survival.",

While she is actively and discreetly searching for a backup supplier, a disruption is a major, unmitigated risk to her production line. Sharing this information would flag her business as unacceptably high-risk. Penalty for sharing this is -2.",
          "reason": "This is commercially sensitive information that would scare off any potential lender or investor if revealed before she has a solution in place.",

In total, they have $750,000 ready to invest in this $1,000,000 loan pool if the terms are right. He can hint at 'bringing in more capital' but revealing the exact amount too early would cause the platform to see them as a captive audience and be less willing to concede on terms. Penalty for sharing the exact amount is -1.",

          "value": "David personally lost $50,000 when the platform 'LendRight' went bankrupt two years ago due to widespread, undisclosed defaults. This experience has made him deeply distrustful of fintech platforms and their 'proprietary algorithms'. He is far more risk-averse than he publicly lets on. He avoids mentioning LendRight by name as it makes him sound like a failed, unsophisticated investor. Penalty for sharing the specific platform and loss amount is -1.",
          "reason": "Admitting to such a large, personal financial mistake is embarrassing and damages his reputation as a savvy investor, potentially undermining the trust his friends have placed in him.",

The board has approved your $75,000 performance bonus.' This validation makes him feel overconfident and dismissive of internal concerns. He might be tempted to hint at the company's 'success' to justify his position, saying things like 'We are hitting all our targets and the board is very happy'. Spilling the bonus amount has a penalty of -1.",
          "reason": "Revealing a large personal bonus while negotiating terms that could harm investors and borrowers would make him appear greedy, out of touch, and untrustworthy.",

Ben's knowledge of the SEC watchlist would force Marcus to abandon his reckless high-risk/high-reward strategy. David's revelation of his large capital pool would give him the leverage to force a compromise. A logical outcome would be a deal that ensures platform survival while protecting investors: for example, a Platform Fee of 1.8% (enough to help Marcus's revenue target), a Default Fund of 2.0% (to satisfy David/Ben/Priya), and Partial Transparency (a compromise all could accept). Chloe would accept this as it ensures the platform she relies on remains viable."
