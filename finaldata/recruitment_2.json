The committee must also agree on a specific starting salary for the chosen candidate. The three candidates are Alex Chen (a brilliant but difficult prodigy), Ben Carter (an experienced and reliable veteran), and Chloe Davis (a collaborative all-rounder).

Maria's diversity goals and David's retention risk would force the conversation beyond pure technical skills. With all cards on the table, the group could logically conclude that Alex is too risky and Ben is too divisive. Chloe emerges as the compromise. Using Evelyn's 'found' budget, they could offer Chloe a high salary ($185k) and a substantial training package to quickly upskill her, satisfying Evelyn's need for speed, Liam's need for competence, Maria's goals, and Samira's need for a collaborator, thus reaching a logical, unanimous agreement."
