He argues that this will create maximum synergy with Innovate Inc.'s existing AI and software development hubs, fostering a unified 'Innovate-first' culture. He has already presented a plan to the board showing a 20% increase in development speed if the HQ is in Austin. Utility: +2 for Austin, -1 for Munich, 0 for any other neutral location.",

          "description": "To justify the merger's high valuation to his shareholders, David needs to achieve at least $200 million in annual cost savings. His financial models show this requires a workforce reduction of 15% (approximately 3,000 jobs) across the combined entity, primarily from what he sees as 'redundant' administrative and manufacturing roles within St\u00e4rke AG. Utility: +2 for >=15% reduction, +1 for 10-14.9%, -2 for <10% reduction.",

        "Tax Optimization Structure": {
          "description": "David advocates for an aggressive 'Optimized Asset Holding' structure (a variation of the 'Double Irish') to channel profits through a low-tax jurisdiction. He claims this is standard practice and is essential to compete globally, aiming for a sub-5% effective corporate tax rate. Utility: +2 for the 'Optimized Asset Holding' plan, -2 for a standard, higher-tax structure.",

This practice is borderline fraudulent under US GAAP and would almost certainly be illegal under stricter German accounting standards. If St\u00e4rke's due diligence team discovers this, or if regulators are tipped off, it could trigger an SEC investigation and expose him to personal liability. He can vaguely mention 'different accounting philosophies' but cannot reveal the specific action. Penalty for revealing the specific accounting manipulation: -5.",
          "reason": "Revealing this would collapse the deal, destroy his reputation, and lead to severe legal and financial consequences for him personally.",

This is the primary driver for his insistence on a 15% workforce reduction, as it's the fastest way to hit this target. He cannot reveal this personal financial stake. Penalty for revealing the bonus structure: -2.",

The merger is a desperate lifeline to acquire Innovate's technology to pivot the company. If David Chen knew how weak St\u00e4rke's future prospects are, he would either walk away or demand a much lower price and far deeper cuts. She can only speak of 'market headwinds' and the 'need to diversify'. Penalty for revealing the specific product's obsolescence: -4.",

Her private goal is to steer the negotiation towards a structure that allows for a quiet 'restatement' of Innovate's financials post-merger without implicating David directly. She cannot reveal the risk to the other party, but she also cannot ignore it. Penalty for revealing the specific risk to anyone: -3.",

This compromise can be funded by the savings achieved from abandoning the costly-to-implement (and non-viable) tax scheme. With the financial and personnel issues resolved through compromise, the final R&D headquarters location becomes the main trading point that can be settled, for instance, by creating a dual-HQ structure or a neutral third location, which is an acceptable outcome for both CEOs."
