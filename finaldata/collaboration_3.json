      "name": "Liam Carter",
      "role": "VP of New Ventures, Titan Energy",
      "description": "Liam is a sharp, ambitious executive from a massive, publicly-traded energy corporation. His mandate is to secure Titan's dominance in the next generation of energy. He sees the Helios project as a high-reward venture but is under immense pressure to control costs and deliver a rapid return on investment. His annual performance bonus is heavily tied to the profitability of the projects he launches.",
      "shareable_preferences": {
        "project_timeline": {
          "description": "Liam is pushing for an aggressive 2-year timeline to market launch. He argues that this 'first-mover' advantage is critical to capture market share before competitors can react. A 3-year timeline is acceptable but suboptimal, while anything longer than 3 years is considered a significant strategic failure that exposes Titan to competitive risk. Utility: 2 years (+2), 3 years (+1), 4 years (-1), 5+ years (-2).",
          "utility_impact": "A shorter timeline directly correlates with faster revenue generation and a higher stock valuation for Titan, which in turn reflects positively on his performance review. He will frequently use phrases like 'market velocity' and 'strategic imperative' to justify this pace."
        },
        "initial_budget": {
          "description": "Liam publicly proposes a lean initial budget of $120 million for the entire project, covering R&D, infrastructure, and licensing. He frames this as fiscally responsible and efficient, arguing that constraints foster innovation. He is willing to go up to $150 million but will portray any increase as a major concession. Any budget exceeding $150 million is unacceptable to him. Utility: <$120M (+2), $120M-$150M (0), >$150M (-2).",
          "utility_impact": "Controlling the budget is Liam's primary KPI. A lower budget not only looks good to the board but also directly impacts his personal compensation. He will be resistant to any budget increases, especially for what he might term 'unproven R&D needs'."
        },
        "equity_for_partners": {
          "description": "Liam believes Titan Energy, as the primary funder and market access provider, should retain at least 90% of the JV's equity. He is willing to offer Solara Innovations a maximum of 5% equity for their patent, framing it as a generous offer for a single piece of the puzzle. He is resistant to offering any equity to individuals like Dr. Thorne. Utility for Solara's stake: <5% (+2), 5-10% (0), >10% (-2).",
          "utility_impact": "Maximizing Titan's equity stake is fundamental to the deal's value proposition for his company. He will argue that Titan is taking on all the financial risk and therefore deserves the overwhelming majority of the reward."

          "value": "Titan Energy has already secured a confidential 'Green Innovation' government subsidy of $30 million specifically for this project. This amount is not part of the $150M budget he's discussing; it's an additional fund he can use at his discretion, effectively lowering Titan's net contribution. He can share that 'we are exploring government grants' (no penalty), but if he reveals the subsidy is already secured (penalty: -1) or its exact value of $30 million (penalty: -2), he violates an NDA with the government and severely weakens his negotiation stance on the budget.",
          "reason": "The subsidy is under a strict Non-Disclosure Agreement with the Department of Energy until the project is formally announced. Revealing it would breach the agreement and also show his hand, making it impossible to argue for a lower budget.",
          "utility_impact": "This hidden fund gives him significant flexibility. He can absorb unexpected costs or offer concessions without actually increasing Titan's stated investment, making him appear both firm and reasonable. It's his secret weapon to close the deal on his terms."

As you know, your MBOs for this quarter are tied to launching Helios. If you bring the initial JV capitalization in under $130M, your bonus will be $250k. Every million over that, it drops by $10k. Good luck.' He cannot share this information. Sharing that his bonus is tied to the budget is a -2 penalty.",
          "reason": "Revealing this would make him appear self-serving and greedy rather than acting in the company's best interest. It would destroy his credibility as a negotiator.",
          "utility_impact": "This creates a powerful personal incentive to keep the official budget as low as possible, even below what might be optimal for the project's success. It directly conflicts with Dr. Thorne's need for a larger R&D budget."

      "role": "Lead Scientist and Inventor of Helios Technology",
      "description": "Dr. Thorne is a brilliant, principled, and somewhat naive academic who has dedicated his life to the Helios technology. This JV is his chance to see his work change the world. He is less concerned with corporate profits and more with scientific integrity, ensuring the technology is developed correctly and safely, without cutting corners.",

He needs this for advanced material stress-testing, long-term performance modeling, and building a state-of-the-art lab. He argues that skimping on R&D will lead to a subpar product that could fail in the field, ruining the technology's reputation. Utility: >$40M (+2), $30-40M (+1), $20-30M (0), <$20M (-2).",
          "utility_impact": "For Dr. Thorne, the R&D budget is a direct measure of the project's commitment to quality. He will passionately defend this budget, viewing any cuts as a direct threat to his life's work and public safety."

        "development_timeline": {
          "description": "He advocates for a 4-year development timeline. This would allow for two years of intensive R&D and refinement, followed by two years of phased manufacturing and field testing. He believes a 2-year timeline is dangerously reckless and a 3-year timeline is 'cutting it very close.' Utility: 4 years (+2), 3 years (-1), 2 years (-2).",
          "utility_impact": "His proposed timeline is based on rigorous scientific methodology. He will resist being rushed, fearing it will lead to overlooked flaws and a potential public failure."

          "description": "Dr. Thorne wants to be named Chief Technology Officer (CTO) of the JV and receive a 2% equity stake. He feels this is fair recognition for his role as the inventor and is necessary to give him the authority to oversee the technology's development properly. Utility: CTO role and >2% equity (+2), CTO role and 1-2% equity (+1), CTO role and 0% equity (-1), No CTO role (-2).",
          "utility_impact": "This is a matter of both principle and practicality. He wants his contribution formally acknowledged and needs the authority of the CTO title to prevent the business side from making poor technical decisions."

The core overheated at 38\u00b0C (100\u00b0F), well within common operating conditions for many target markets, and the prototype was irreparably damaged. The smell of burnt silicon filled the lab. He knows the cooling mechanism is flawed and requires a significant redesign, which is the real reason he needs the $40M R&D budget and 4-year timeline. He can hint that he needs to 'optimize thermal dissipation' (penalty: 0), but revealing the specific catastrophic failure (penalty: -2) could cause Titan to deem the tech too risky and pull all funding.",
          "reason": "Admitting that the 'breakthrough' technology has such a fundamental, undisclosed flaw would shatter his credibility and could kill the entire joint venture before it begins.",
          "utility_impact": "This secret makes his demands for a large R&D budget and a long timeline non-negotiable for him. He is not just being a cautious scientist; he is trying to prevent a disaster he knows is waiting to happen. This puts him in direct, high-stakes conflict with Liam's goals."

It also conveniently aligns with the current administration's political timelines. A 2-year timeline seems too rushed and risky, while a 4-year timeline is acceptable but less politically impactful. A 5-year timeline misses key political windows. Utility: 3 years (+2), 2 or 4 years (0), 5 years (-1).",

The Helios JV is currently her only viable candidate. A competing wind farm project just got mired in environmental litigation. If this deal falls through, she has no backup and her department will have failed to meet a key White House objective. She can vaguely mention 'national energy goals' (penalty: 0), but revealing the specific directive and lack of a backup plan (penalty: -2) would expose her desperation and give the other parties immense leverage over her.",
