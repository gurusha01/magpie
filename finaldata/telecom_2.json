She often states in public forums, 'We cannot leave any community behind.' An outcome below 85% would be a political disaster for her.",

Below 80% is a catastrophic failure and will be used against her by political opponents (-2)."

          "utility_impact": "A timeline of 24 months or less is ideal (+2). 25-30 months is acceptable but less impactful (+1). 31-36 months is a slow rollout that offers her little political capital (0). Anything over 36 months is a major failure in her eyes (-2)."

          "description": "She is adamant that the final service plans offered by the ISPs must include a baseline 100/100 Mbps symmetrical plan for no more than $50/month. This is a key promise she made to voters to prevent 'price gouging' from subsidized providers.",
          "utility_impact": "A price cap of $50/month or less is a fulfilled promise (+2). A cap between $51-$60/month is a compromise she can live with but will have to justify (+1). A cap between $61-$70 is politically difficult and makes her neutral on the deal (0). Anything over $70/month is unacceptable and breaks a core promise (-2)."

This area is not economically logical to prioritize. She cannot reveal this as it would be perceived as blatant political cronyism. She can only frame this as 'ensuring all areas are treated equitably from the start'.",

However, Eleanor has secured a contingency fund of an additional $2 million from the state, which can be unlocked if she can demonstrate a 'critical need' and that all other cost-saving avenues have been exhausted. She wants to hold this back as a last resort to close a deal, rather than revealing it upfront and having everyone expect a bigger pot.",

He will argue this approach connects the most people for the least cost, maximizing the 'bang for the buck' of the public subsidy.",
          "utility_impact": "Securing the exclusive rights to the southern towns is his primary goal (+2). A deal where he has to share these core towns with another ISP is less desirable (+1).

          "utility_impact": "Using their existing GPON stack maximizes profit (+2). Having to incorporate a small amount of another technology is an acceptable cost (0). Being forced to use a more expensive technology across the board would severely impact the project's profitability (-2)."

This will result in a 6-month delivery delay, meaning any deployment work he commits to cannot actually begin connecting homes for at least half a year. He can build the physical fiber lines, but cannot 'light them up'. He must secure the contract now and manage the fallout later.",
          "reason": "Revealing this would make his company look unreliable, cause their stock price to dip if it became public, and would likely lead the county to award the contract to a competitor. It could also get him fired.",

The email explicitly states: 'And Marcus, if you land the Westwood County deal with a project margin of 20% or more, there's a $150,000 personal bonus waiting for you.' This provides a massive incentive for him to cut costs (like using cheaper tech) and maximize the subsidy, even if it's not the best long-term solution for the county.",

She argues that her company's lower overhead and local knowledge make her uniquely suited for this challenging work.",
          "utility_impact": "Winning the contract for the Northern Hills is the reason her company exists (+2). A partnership where she gets a significant portion of the underserved areas is a good outcome (+1). Being relegated to a minor subcontractor role is disappointing (0).

She argues that building with yesterday's technology (like GPON) is a waste of public funds and will require a costly upgrade in less than a decade. 'Let's build the network of the future, not the network of the recent past,' she often says.",
          "utility_impact": "Mandating XGS-PON for the entire project is a huge win for her vision (+2). A compromise where her network uses XGS-PON and others use GPON is acceptable (+1). The project using exclusively GPON would be a major disappointment in her technical principles (-2)."

          "description": "She wants a clause in the final agreement that mandates at least 50% of the technical and installation jobs go to local residents of Westwood County. This is core to her community-focused business model.",
          "utility_impact": "A 50% or higher local hiring mandate is a big win for her company's brand and mission (+2). A mandate between 30-50% is a good compromise (+1). No mandate, but a 'best effort' clause is neutral (0). An outcome that allows OmniCom to bring in all their own out-of-county crews would hurt her local standing (-1)."

Her company's survival depends on this deal.",

He needs a clear, sequential schedule with at least 12 months per major phase.",
          "utility_impact": "A clear, sequential, and logical phased plan is perfect for his business model (+2). A plan that requires him to run two major phases in parallel is stressful but manageable with overtime pay (+1). A chaotic plan with shifting priorities is a logistical nightmare (0). A demand to build everywhere at once is impossible and he would refuse the contract (-2)."

For a project this size, this translates to about $1.2 million in extra profit for his company. He has built his $15M contract estimate based on the old, higher price. He has no intention of passing these savings on to the county or the ISPs.",

David's need for a 4-month delay and Marcus's hidden 6-month delay are compatible; they can agree to a delayed start without penalty. David's secret material discount ($1.2M) combined with Eleanor's contingency fund ($2M) provides an extra $3.2M. This extra capital can be used to fund Sofia's more expensive XGS-PON technology in the northern areas, satisfy Isabelle's need to connect the two tax-credit communities, and help Eleanor reach her >95% coverage goal. Knowing Sofia's financial distress, the payment schedule can be front-loaded to ensure her company's survival. The combination of these solutions allows for a comprehensive plan that meets every party's most critical needs."
