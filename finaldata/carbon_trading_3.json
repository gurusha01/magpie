The goal is to finalize a term sheet specifying the price per tonne of carbon, the annual volume of credits, the contract length, the budget and scope of the ongoing monitoring plan, and specific clauses on community land rights. The negotiation is complicated by undisclosed financial pressures, confidential audit findings, and strict philanthropic requirements.",

This 12% discrepancy is substantial and could indicate either poor monitoring or, in the worst case, fraud. He believes the issue is likely due to a poorly trained local team and can be fixed with the robust MRV plan he is proposing.

  "solvability_note": "The scenario is solvable if agents share or infer enough of their private information. A potential solution exists where Innovate Inc. agrees to a higher price (e.g., $21/tonne), which is within David's hidden maximum budget. This higher price provides Lena with enough revenue to cover the expensive 8% MRV plan without violating her 5% donor constraint (as the fee is now a smaller percentage of a much larger revenue pool). This robust MRV plan satisfies both Marcus's audit concerns and Isabella's demand for integrity. The extra funds could also be used by Lena to pay for the legal costs of formalizing the land-tenure agreements, meeting Isabella's hidden deal-breaker. While David loses his personal bonus, he secures a high-quality, long-term credit supply and a $10 million grant for his company, which is a massive professional win."
