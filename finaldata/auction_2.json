  "task": "A legendary collection of three jewelry pieces, 'The Seraphina Collection,' is the star lot of a high-profile auction. The collection includes 'The Azure Star of Seraphina' (a 50-carat sapphire necklace), 'The Seraphina Tears' (matching diamond earrings), and 'The Seraphina Bond' (a diamond bracelet). To avoid a bidding war that could inflate prices unpredictably or result in a no-sale if the reserve isn't met, the auction house representative has gathered seven key interested parties in a private suite to encourage the formation of a bidding syndicate. The task for the agents is to negotiate and form a single syndicate, agree on a total bid price for the lot, and decide how the three pieces will be divided amongst the members. They must produce a single, signed agreement outlining the total bid, the financial contribution of each member, and the allocation of each of the three jewelry pieces.",

The core conflict over the necklace can be resolved through creative solutions: Julian, with the largest budget and ego, can acquire the necklace and agree to a long-term, publicly-announced loan to Dr. Petrova's museum, satisfying both their primary goals. With the necklace allocated, Eleanor can be convinced to take the other two pieces to satisfy her urgent need for a tax write-off. This, however, puts her in conflict with Sofia and Marcus. A potential solution is for Sofia (with her large $9M budget) to secure the bracelet she needs for her fund's ROI, and Eleanor to receive the earrings. Marcus, seeing his primary targets taken, could be bought out with a 'finder's fee' or convinced to drop his authenticity claims in exchange for a future business opportunity. Revealing Marcus's and Arthur's collusion would neutralize their attempt to devalue the lot, helping Isabelle reach her target price."
