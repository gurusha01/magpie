The agreement must cover financial contributions, room and space allocation, house rules, and member exit strategies. Each agent has undisclosed personal circumstances that heavily influence their desired outcomes, creating a complex web of conflicting needs.",

She argues that her unpredictable on-call schedule and need for absolute quiet to ensure she is fit for surgery make this non-negotiable. She is willing to pay a premium on her share (up to 5% more than an even split) to secure it.",
          "utility_impact": "Getting the master bedroom is critical for her well-being and job performance (+2 Utility). Getting a standard bedroom would be a significant compromise she would resent (-1 Utility). Being allocated a space without a private bathroom is a deal-breaker (-2 Utility)."

          "utility_impact": "A strict, codified quiet policy provides her with peace of mind (+1.5 Utility). A moderate, flexible policy is acceptable but not ideal (0 Utility). A very liberal or non-existent policy would make her living situation untenable (-2 Utility)."

          "description": "She advocates for an exit clause that allows a member to sell their share with only 90 days' notice. The remaining members would have the right of first refusal for 30 days, after which the share can be sold on the open market to a pre-vetted buyer.",
          "utility_impact": "A flexible 90-day exit clause gives her crucial career flexibility (+1 Utility). A moderately restrictive clause of 6-12 months is a negative but manageable (-0.5 Utility). A long-term lock-in period of over a year is a major problem (-1.5 Utility)."

She believes she has a 75% chance of getting the offer, which would require her to relocate within 12-18 months. Her plan is to secure the apartment as a high-end 'home base' for now, and then sell her share for a quick profit when she moves. Revealing this would make the others see her as a disingenuous and unstable partner.",

          "utility_impact": "This arrangement would greatly ease his current financial burden (+2 Utility). Having to pay an even 20% share will stretch him to his absolute limit (0 Utility). Being asked to contribute more, for example to a contingency fund, is financially impossible (-2 Utility)."

She hasn't mentioned the dog to anyone.",

He argues this ensures stability and commitment.",

For instance: Eleanor's short-term plan could be accommodated with a special exit clause where she pays a penalty or is responsible for finding a replacement. Liam's, Chloe's and Sofia's financial issues would lead the group to reject expensive, immediate upgrades (kitchen) and restructure the contingency fund (perhaps funding it over time). Ben's trauma could be addressed with specific legal protections that don't unfairly punish others. The room allocation could be resolved by understanding who *truly* needs what (Ben and Liam need offices for work, Eleanor needs quiet, Chloe needs light), possibly leading to Sofia taking a smaller room for a reduced buy-in."
