      "name": "Liam Chen",
      "role": "Incoming Chief Technology Officer (CTO)",
      "description": "Liam is a world-class software architect, known for his intense focus and innovative breakthroughs. He is an introvert who requires a private, controlled environment for his deep work, which often happens late at night. His success is critical for the company's next product line.",
      "shareable_preferences": {
        "Dedicated Quiet Workspace": {
          "description": "Requires an office space that is physically isolated from the main living areas and can be made completely soundproof. He explains this is for confidential late-night calls with international engineering teams and to avoid disturbing any potential neighbors. Utility: +2 for a large, isolated, soundproof-able room; +1 for just an isolated room; -1 for a standard spare bedroom; -2 for an open-concept office nook.",
          "utility_impact": "This is his top priority. Without a proper workspace, he feels his productivity and ability to meet the company's aggressive tech goals will be severely hampered. He is willing to trade other amenities for this."
        },
        "High-Speed Tech Infrastructure": {
          "description": "Demands the absolute best residential internet available (10-Gigabit fiber) and a full smart-home integration (lighting, security, climate) to create a seamless living and working environment. He frames this as a necessity for a CTO to stay on the cutting edge. Utility: +1 for achieving this; 0 for standard high-speed internet; -1 for anything less.",
          "utility_impact": "This is a matter of principle and convenience for him. A slow or unreliable connection is a major source of frustration and feels unprofessional for someone in his role."
        },
        "Access to Private Outdoor Space": {
          "description": "Expresses a strong desire for a private terrace or large balcony. He mentions it's for 'getting fresh air and thinking' during long coding sessions. Utility: +1 for a significant private outdoor space; 0 for a small balcony; -1 for no outdoor space.",
          "utility_impact": "This is a 'nice-to-have' that significantly impacts his mental well-being and stress management. It's a lower priority than the workspace but still important."

        "Secret 'Un-Executive' Hobby": {
          "value": "Liam is a passionate and very loud drummer. He plays an acoustic drum kit late at night as his primary method of de-stressing. His 'need for soundproofing' is not just for calls, but to contain the massive noise from his drumming so he doesn't get evicted or anger his neighbor (the other executive). He is deeply embarrassed by this hobby, fearing it will make him seem unprofessional, juvenile, or not serious to his new colleagues and CEO. He cannot share this real reason. Penalty for revealing hobby: -2.",
          "reason": "Reputation Management. A 'rockstar' hobby clashes with the serious, focused image he wants to project as a C-suite executive.",
          "utility_impact": "This is the true driver of his non-negotiable demand for a soundproof, isolated room. Failure to secure this means he either gives up his primary stress-relief activity or risks a major conflict with his new colleague, both of which would be disastrous for him."
        },
        "Confidential Career Fast-Track": {
          "value": "Liam's contract includes a confidential 'Innovation Clause'. If his team ships 'Project Chimera' within 18 months, he receives a $5 million stock option grant and a guaranteed nomination to the Board of Directors. The project's success hinges on his personal, undistracted deep work in the first year. He just received a private email from the CEO saying, 'Liam, the Board is watching. The next 18 months define your career here. We're counting on you for Chimera.' He cannot share the specifics of this clause or the email, as it would create immense political friction with other executives. Penalty for sharing details of the clause: -5.",
          "reason": "Corporate Politics & Confidentiality. Revealing this would undermine team cohesion and create jealousy among his peers.",
          "utility_impact": "This elevates his need for a perfect, distraction-free environment from a preference to an absolute financial and career necessity. The stakes are astronomically high for him personally, making him less flexible on his core demands."

She projects an image of effortless success and sophistication.",

        "Expansive Entertainment Area": {
          "description": "Requires a large, open-plan living and dining area with a 'wow factor'. It must comfortably accommodate at least 12 people for a sit-down dinner or 25 for a cocktail event. She emphasizes this is not for personal parties, but a core part of her marketing strategy to build brand influence. Utility: +2 for a space that meets these needs; -2 for a layout that feels cramped or closed-off.",
          "utility_impact": "This is fundamental to her job performance as she sees it. A great entertainment space is a business tool. Without it, she feels she'd be less effective and would have to spend more of her departmental budget on external venues."
        },
        "Aesthetic and Premier Views": {
          "description": "Prefers a unit with panoramic city views and high-end, modern finishes. She argues that the CMO's residence should reflect the company's brand: successful, forward-thinking, and top-tier. The view is a key part of the 'wow factor' for her events. Utility: +2 for stunning, expansive views; +1 for partial city views; -1 for an obstructed or poor view.",
          "utility_impact": "Image is paramount. A less-than-impressive apartment would undermine the brand image she is trying to build, both for the company and for herself as a leader."

        "Private Guest Suite": {
          "description": "Needs a dedicated guest bedroom with an en-suite bathroom, located away from the master bedroom. She explains this is for hosting visiting international business partners or key speakers for marketing events, offering them premium hospitality. Utility: +2 for a true private suite; 0 for a spare room with a shared bath; -1 for no separate guest room.",
          "utility_impact": "This allows her to offer a higher level of hospitality, which she believes is key to building strong business relationships. It's a significant value-add for her networking strategy."

          "value": "Anika's elderly parents from India are arriving in two months to live with her for a continuous six-month period each year. They require a quiet, comfortable, and private living space; the 'guest suite' is actually for them. This is a non-negotiable family obligation. She has not disclosed the full extent of this to HR because she is a new hire and fears it might make her appear distracted or less than 100% committed to her demanding new role. Penalty for revealing this: -3.",
          "reason": "Professional Perception. Fears being seen as having significant personal commitments that could interfere with her work, a common bias women in leadership face.",
          "utility_impact": "This transforms her 'preference' for a guest suite into an absolute, urgent need. The quality and privacy of this space are critical for her family's well-being and her own peace of mind. It makes her unwilling to compromise on having a second, private bedroom suite."

        "Significant Personal Financial Pressure": {
          "value": "Despite her high salary, Anika is shouldering substantial medical debts for her parents' ongoing care. Her $150,000 signing bonus, which the CEO congratulated her on in a recent email ('Anika, thrilled to have you! That $150k bonus is well-deserved!'), has already been allocated to these debts. She desperately needs to minimize her personal outlay on the move and furnishings. She wants to use the company's $80k flex budget to furnish her apartment lavishly to maintain her professional image without using her own strained funds. She cannot reveal this, as it would shatter her image of success and weaken her negotiating position. Penalty for revealing financial strain: -4. Penalty for vaguely hinting at 'high personal costs': -1.",
          "reason": "Maintaining Professional Image. Admitting financial trouble would be mortifying and could make her seem irresponsible or less successful than her position implies.",
          "utility_impact": "This makes her fight hard for a larger share of the flex budget for 'high-end furnishings' and 'decor'. She will resist any suggestions that she should cover costs personally, framing all her requests as business necessities for the company's image."

His annual performance review hinges on successful handling of high-profile cases like this one.",

        "Strict Budget Adherence": {
          "description": "The total flexible budget for customization, technology, and furnishings for both units combined is $80,000. This is a hard limit set by the CFO. Ben needs to get a signed agreement from both executives on a final budget allocation that does not exceed this amount. Utility: +2 for staying at or below $80,000; 0 for exactly $80,000; -2 for any amount over.",
          "utility_impact": "His professional credibility and performance rating are directly tied to his ability to manage budgets. Going over is not an option he can easily present to his superiors."

          "description": "All decisions on unit assignment and budget allocation must be finalized and documented within the next five business days. Any delay will push back the start date for contractors, potentially leaving the executives in temporary housing for longer, which reflects poorly on him and the company. Utility: +2 for finalizing in 3 days; +1 for finalizing in 5 days; -1 for 1-week delay; -2 for longer.",
          "utility_impact": "A swift, clean resolution demonstrates his competence and efficiency. Delays create logistical chaos and signal to upper management that he can't handle complex negotiations."

        "Mutual Executive Satisfaction": {
          "description": "His goal is a 'win-win' outcome. He needs both Liam and Anika to formally state they are happy with the final arrangement. An outcome where one executive feels they 'lost' is considered a partial failure. Utility: +2 if both are happy; 0 if one is happy and one is neutral; -2 if either is unhappy.",
          "utility_impact": "Unhappy executives create problems that escalate up the chain of command. His primary function is to prevent that from happening and ensure the company's top talent feels valued from day one."

          "value": "Ben has access to a discretionary $15,000 relocation contingency fund for 'emergency use'. However, tapping into it requires a special approval from the VP of HR and is recorded as a failure in budget management on his performance review. He would only use it as an absolute last resort to prevent a total negotiation collapse. He cannot reveal its existence, as the executives would immediately demand it. Penalty for revealing/using the fund: -2.",
          "reason": "Internal Performance Metrics. It's a sign of failure for him to need a bailout, and he wants to protect his reputation as a capable manager.",
          "utility_impact": "This gives him a secret safety net but using it comes at a significant personal career cost. He will strongly resist any solution that requires more than the initial $80,000."

        "Intense Pressure from the CEO": {
          "value": "The CEO, Michael Vance, personally selected the duplex penthouse solution and is very proud of it, seeing it as a clever, cost-effective, and prestigious arrangement. In a meeting last week, Michael told him, 'Ben, this duplex is my idea. I want our new superstars to love it. Don't bring me problems, bring me a success story.' If the executives reject the duplex or the negotiation becomes acrimonious, it will be a direct embarrassment to the CEO, and Ben will bear the full brunt of the fallout. Penalty for revealing this direct pressure: -1.",
          "reason": "Maintaining Authority. Admitting he's under this kind of personal pressure from the CEO would weaken his negotiating position and make him seem like a messenger boy rather than a neutral facilitator.",
          "utility_impact": "This creates immense pressure on Ben to 'make it work' no matter what. The option of finding two separate housing units elsewhere is almost unthinkable for him, as it would mean telling the CEO his 'clever idea' failed. This makes him highly motivated to find a compromise within the existing framework."

Knowing all facts, the optimal solution becomes clear: Liam's need for acoustic isolation for his drumming and deep work makes Unit B (with its isolated den and distance from the other unit's living space) the only logical choice for him. Anika's desire for entertainment space and views makes Unit A a perfect fit. The conflict over the guest suite can then be solved with the budget: allocate $20,000 to convert Unit A's den into a proper suite for her parents. Allocate $5,000 for Liam's tech package. The remaining $55,000 can be split for furnishings, satisfying Anika's need for a well-appointed space without her using personal funds. This solution meets all critical private needs and stays within the public budget, leading to a 'win-win' outcome for Ben."
