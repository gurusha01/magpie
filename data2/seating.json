A longer event risks fatigue and potential for unscripted, negative interactions. A shorter one feels rushed and dismissive. He gets +2 utility for a schedule between 2h 15m and 2h 45m. He gets -1 for anything over 3 hours, and -2 for under 2 hours.",
          "utility_impact": "This preference for a tight schedule is driven by his desire to minimize opportunities for friction.

He wants the host leader in the center, with the leaders of Country B and C on either side, in that order, based on standard diplomatic precedent. He gets +1 for a rectangular table and 0 for any other shape. Deviating from the standard B-then-C seating order gives him -2 utility as it would be a break from his country's established protocol.",

This dinner is to promote trilateral cooperation, and their side-deals must not overshadow our message.' He cannot reveal that this is a direct order from the highest level. He can only frame it as a 'strong suggestion' for 'maintaining focus'. If he reveals this is a direct order, the penalty is -2, as it makes his government appear heavy-handed and undermines his own negotiating authority.",

Her plan relies on extensive pre-screening of all staff, electronic surveillance, and quick-reaction teams staged out of sight. She gets +2 utility for no visible guards in the dining hall. She gets -1 for up to two visible guards, and -2 for more than two, as it signals a failure of her preferred methodology.",

Security cannot officially be seen as going over budget this quarter.' She cannot reveal the specific nature of the threat (as it would expose intelligence sources) or that her department is trying to hide the cost.

He gets +2 for the seat of honor, 0 for a neutral arrangement, and -2 for any perceived slight or subordinate position.",

A round table is actually worse for this, as the acoustics are more challenging than a head table where conversation is more directed.
