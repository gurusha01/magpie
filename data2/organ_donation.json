      "description": "Dr. Sharma is a renowned surgeon at a top-tier, private hospital known for its high success rates and wealthy clientele. Her primary motivation is to maintain her department's stellar reputation and secure funding through successful, high-profile cases. She is pragmatic and data-driven, but also fiercely protective of her hospital's image.",

This is not just about one patient; it's about ensuring the long-term future and technological advancement of her department. A successful outcome would be a major PR victory. Utility: +2 if Mr. Harrison gets the liver and the transplant is positioned as a major success; -2 if the liver goes elsewhere and her hospital is perceived as 'losing' to a competitor; 0 if a compromise is reached where her hospital's reputation is not enhanced but also not harmed.",

Her patient, Mr. Harrison, has a perfect on-paper record of compliance, a stable home life, and financial resources to cover any ancillary costs. Utility: +1 if the chosen patient has a documented compliance score above 90%; -1 if the chosen patient has a history of non-compliance, as she sees this as a waste of a precious resource.",

His pre-sobriety medical charts, which she has reviewed in detail, show patterns of liver enzyme spikes consistent with binge drinking. While he is technically eligible, she privately assesses his risk of relapse post-transplant as a moderate 25-30%. Sharing this would be a massive HIPAA violation and would instantly disqualify her patient, causing a scandal and losing the hospital a major donor.

They are currently operating with a skeleton crew, stretching resources thin. Their current coordinator-to-patient ratio is 1:7, well below their advertised 1:4 standard.

He will argue that every day she waits, her chances of survival plummet.

Dr. Carter received a confidential email from the hospital's CFO last week stating that if his department cannot improve its 'high-profile success metrics,' it will face a 20% budget cut next fiscal year. A successful liver transplant would be the most significant positive metric he could achieve. Revealing this would make him look desperate and self-serving, undermining his altruistic arguments. Penalty for mentioning the budget cuts or the CFO's email: -1.",

There is no official UOSN protocol for this variant, but a single, not-yet-peer-reviewed study from a European journal suggests it *could* correlate with a 5% higher rate of chronic rejection after 10 years. Disclosing this would cause undue panic and potentially lead to the organ being discarded, which she sees as a tragedy. It would also be a violation of UOSN's internal data-sharing policy. Penalty for revealing the specific genetic marker: -2.",
          "reason": "Violating UOSN protocol, preventing a life-saving organ from being used based on inconclusive data, and professional reprimand.",

We need to get our liver numbers out of the basement before the Q4 review.' This pressure makes her intensely risk-averse. A failed transplant would be a personal and professional disaster for her.

For example, they could agree to give the organ to the more urgent patient, Ms. Garcia, but only under the condition that she is temporarily housed in a hospital-funded recovery apartment and her post-operative care is co-managed by the better-resourced (despite the temporary shortage) Prestige Medical Center. This addresses the key risks associated with her case and allows all parties to achieve a partial victory."
