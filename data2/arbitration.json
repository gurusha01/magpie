If I mention the source ('FutureTech Ventures') or the amount ($5M), the penalty is -2.",

Klaus's blatant IP theft for his new venture (provable by Anya's server logs) would nullify his claim to 50% of the assets and expose him to a massive lawsuit. Faced with this, a rational Klaus would relinquish his claim to the IP for a small 'go away' settlement to avoid legal ruin. David's private valuation ($12M) justifies giving the IP to Anya in exchange for a significant equity stake in her new, well-funded ($5M from FutureTech) venture, which represents a better potential ROI for him than a fire sale. The company's $2M cash can be used to pay Ben Carter's options handsomely (e.g., $300k) to ensure he joins Anya's new company (securing the IP's 'tribal knowledge'), with the remainder used for the small settlement to Klaus and legal fees. This satisfies the core interests of almost every party while punishing the bad actor."
