She has meticulously budgeted the film and believes this amount is the absolute minimum required to achieve the desired cinematic quality, including on-location shooting in Ireland and hiring a top-tier cinematographer. A budget of $35 million would be ideal to allow for a more flexible shooting schedule and higher-end post-production effects. Anything below $28 million will force compromises that she feels will critically damage the film's quality.",
          "utility_impact": "Getting $35M is +2 (perfect vision realized). $30M is +1 (vision achieved with tight control). $28M is -1 (significant compromises). Below $28M is -2 (project is artistically compromised)."

          "description": "Retain 'Final Cut' rights. Lena feels she is the guardian of the writer's vision and must have the final say on the released version of the film. She is willing to collaborate with the studio on notes, but she cannot accept a deal where the financier can unilaterally re-edit the movie for commercial purposes.",

The writer, under a strict NDA with Lena, recently delivered a revised draft that introduces a subtle, Hitchcock-style psychological thriller element in the third act. Lena believes this change makes the film vastly more marketable and awards-worthy without sacrificing its artistic core. She is contractually forbidden from discussing the specifics of this change until the lead actor is formally attached. If she reveals the new twist, the writer could sue her and walk away from the project.",

His ideal scenario is a $22 million budget, which he believes is achievable with a non-union crew and tax credits.",

As a reward, he has been granted discretionary access to a $5 million 'Innovation Fund' to be used on a single, high-potential project this year. He cannot reveal the existence of this fund, as it would set a precedent for every producer to demand more money and undermine his negotiating position on all future projects. The email states, 'Marcus, great work on the Q3 savings. I'm authorizing a one-time $5M innovation fund for you to champion a project you truly believe in. Use it wisely and don't make it common knowledge.'",

This data makes 'The Galway Echo' worth significantly more to StreamVerse than David is publicly letting on, potentially justifying an investment of up to $28 million.

I'd do it for half my fee if it means we protect the script and I get to shoot in Ireland for the summer. Just make sure I don't look weak.'

If information is revealed: David, knowing the film's immense value from his data, can increase his offer (e.g., to $25M). Marcus can justify using his secret $5M fund. This brings the total available financing to $30M from the financiers. Simultaneously, Isabella, to secure Lena's creative control for her client, can agree to the privately-desired $10M salary. This allows a $30M budget ($20M for production + $10M for the actor), satisfying everyone's core private needs."
