He just received an email from his manager saying, 'Richard, you're so close to that Q3 bonus! The sale of Elm Street over $825k will lock it in for you. Don't let it slip away!'

Eleanor's minimum acceptable price to net her $725k is roughly $792,553 (P - 0.06P - $20k = $725k). Ben's maximum price is $830,000. This leaves a bargaining range of approximately $37,000. The negotiation then centers on how the $25,000 repair cost is distributed within this range. For example, a deal at $815,000 with a $25,000 credit to the buyer would result in an effective price of $790,000 for Ben (good for him) and a net price of $815,000 for Eleanor, which meets her needs. The key is for the agents to see through the bluffs and address the real, underlying constraints."
