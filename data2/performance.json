      "description": "Eleanor is the long-serving Chair of Innovate Inc.'s board. Her primary responsibility is to ensure long-term shareholder value and company stability. She has a deep understanding of the company's internal politics and strategic positioning. She personally recruited CEO Alex Chen and has a strong, professional relationship with him.",

        "Maintain Leadership Stability": {
          "description": "Eleanor strongly believes that a sudden change in leadership would create significant market uncertainty and internal disruption, potentially jeopardizing key long-term initiatives. She advocates for renewing Alex Chen's contract to project an image of stability and steady leadership. A simple renewal is her ideal outcome.",
          "utility_impact": "Renewing the contract provides a utility of +2. Placing the CEO on a Performance Improvement Plan (PIP) creates uncertainty and is neutral (0). Terminating the contract would be a disaster in her view, yielding a utility of -2."

        "Responsible Executive Compensation": {
          "description": "Eleanor is acutely aware of public and shareholder scrutiny regarding executive pay. She wants to award a performance bonus that is justifiable and avoids controversy. She believes a bonus between 5% and 10% of the CEO's base salary ($2M) is appropriate and defensible. A bonus above 15% would attract negative press.",
          "utility_impact": "A bonus in the 5-10% range ($100k-$200k) gives her +1 utility. A bonus below 5% is acceptable (0 utility). A bonus above 15% ($300k+) would be a public relations headache and gives her -1 utility."

          "value": "Eleanor is the lead negotiator in a secret, high-stakes merger talk with a larger competitor, a deal codenamed 'Project Nightingale'. The deal is valued at an additional $500M for Innovate Inc. The acquiring party's CEO has explicitly stated, in writing, that their confidence in the deal is 'predicated on the continued leadership and strategic vision of Alex Chen' for at least the next 18 months. If Chen is fired, the deal will immediately collapse. She can allude to 'sensitive strategic partnerships' but cannot mention a merger or the critical role of the CEO.",
          "reason": "Revealing this information would violate strict Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDAs) and SEC regulations against insider trading, leading to severe legal penalties for her and the company, and would instantly terminate the merger.",
          "utility_impact": "The success of this merger is her primary, hidden objective. Any hint about a 'strategic partnership' carries a penalty of -1. Explicitly mentioning a 'merger' or 'acquisition' carries a penalty of -2."

        "A Fractured Board": {
          "value": "The Board of Directors is dangerously split on Alex Chen's performance. A recent informal straw poll resulted in a 4-4 tie. As Chairperson, Eleanor holds the deciding vote. She cannot reveal this division, as it would fatally undermine her authority and signal to the other agents, especially the activist investor Sofia, that the board is weak and can be manipulated.",
          "reason": "Admitting the board is deadlocked would project weakness and invite a hostile proxy battle from Sofia's fund. It is crucial to maintain an appearance of unified board control.",

He will present a balanced view of the CEO's performance, highlighting both strengths (operational efficiency) and weaknesses (innovation culture), and wants his final recommendation to be adopted verbatim. His credibility is tied to this.",

          "description": "He wants this high-profile engagement to serve as a case study for his firm's expertise. A smooth, professional process that leads to a clear, defensible outcome will be a major win. A messy, contentious negotiation that leaks to the press would be damaging.",

          "value": "While the publicly shared summary report is 'balanced', the raw data is alarming. The company's 'Innovation Culture' score is at the 15th percentile for their industry, and the rate of new product development has halved under Chen's tenure. Marcus's internal models predict that this will lead to a catastrophic loss of market share within 18-24 months. He has an email from his managing partner congratulating him on the contract, which ends with, 'Remember, our firm's reputation for foresight is on the line. Don't be afraid to make the tough call.' He can share that innovation is 'an area for development', but revealing the 15th percentile figure would expose his official report as overly diplomatic and could anger the board.",
          "reason": "Client confidentiality protocols prevent him from sharing raw, unvarnished data without permission. Doing so would be seen as unprofessional and could jeopardize future contracts by making his firm seem unreliable and difficult to work with.",
          "utility_impact": "Revealing the specific '15th percentile' statistic or the internal prediction of 'catastrophic loss' carries a -2 penalty. Strongly hinting that innovation is a 'critical failure point' carries a -1 penalty."

          "value": "Two weeks ago, Marcus's firm was invited by Sofia Rossi's activist fund, 'Vanguard Activist Capital,' to bid on a massive, portfolio-wide consulting project worth an estimated $5M. During a preliminary call, the fund's representative noted that they 'value consultants who aren't afraid to challenge the status quo' and that they would be 'watching the outcome of the Innovate Inc. evaluation closely.' Siding with Sofia could significantly increase his chances of winning this lucrative contract.",
          "reason": "This is a clear conflict of interest. Admitting that his judgment could be swayed by a potential future contract would destroy his credibility as an objective arbiter and violate his firm's code of ethics.",

She is publicly demanding a leadership change or, at a minimum, a radical strategic shift towards high-risk, high-reward markets. She wants to see the CEO replaced or put on a PIP with explicit, aggressive growth targets.",
          "utility_impact": "Terminating the CEO or putting him on a strict, growth-oriented PIP would align with her fund's goals, yielding +2 utility. A simple contract renewal represents a failure to enact change and gives her -2 utility."

A leadership shake-up is the fastest way to signal a change in direction.",

Her team has a 150-page turnaround plan, 'Project Phoenix,' that this new CEO has agreed to implement. The plan involves divesting two of Innovate Inc.'s legacy divisions. This plan is completely incompatible with Alex Chen's leadership style and skillset. She can talk about 'needing a different kind of leader' but cannot reveal she has one on standby.",
          "reason": "Revealing that she has a replacement ready would be seen as a hostile, premeditated attack, not a good-faith negotiation. It would cause the board to entrench, leak to the press, and could trigger SEC investigations into market manipulation.",

          "value": "Sofia's $2M personal bonus for the year is explicitly contingent on Innovate Inc.'s stock price rising by 15% before the end of the fiscal year (in 10 months). All internal models run by her fund show that this is impossible under the current leadership's trajectory. She recently received an email from her managing director saying, 'The clock is ticking on INNC stock. Your bonus depends on it.' This creates immense personal pressure for her to force a change.",
          "reason": "Revealing that her advocacy is tied to a personal financial windfall would make her arguments seem self-serving rather than for the benefit of all shareholders, completely undermining her negotiating position.",

Sofia would learn that firing the CEO would destroy a $500M merger, a short-term loss far greater than her potential stock gains. Eleanor would learn that the company faces a long-term existential threat due to a lack of innovation, making a simple renewal irresponsible. Marcus's conflicting pressures would be understood. The logical compromise is to renew the CEO's contract (securing the merger for Eleanor) but place him on a strict, publicly-monitored Performance Improvement Plan focused exclusively on hitting aggressive innovation targets (satisfying Sofia's need for change and addressing Marcus's data)."
