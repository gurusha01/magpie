The project cannot proceed without a unanimous agreement on four key parameters: Development Scale (number of suites), Environmental Conservation Area (in hectares), Local Community Fund (in USD), and Project Timeline (in months). The meeting is the last chance to reach a deal before the development permits expire.",
